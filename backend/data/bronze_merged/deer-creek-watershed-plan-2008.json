This draft of the Watershed \nImplementation Plan focuses on the upper Deer Creek watershed, which extends from Lake \nBolivar to Rolling Fork, and drains about 71,000 acres of the Yazoo River Basin in western \nMississippi. In 2005, a Washington County Deer Creek Watershed Association was formed to \naddress the water quality issues in Deer Creek and its watershed. In 2007, the Watershed \nAssociation expanded to consider Deer Creek from its source above Lake Bolivar to Rolling \nFork, Mississippi. \nThe Deer Creek Watershed Association is a cooperative, inclusive organization of \nresidents dedicated to improving the quality of life for people who live near and visit Deer \nCreek, by providing examples of effective stewardship through restoration, management, and \nconservation of our natural resources. Information on the Deer Creek Watershed Association \nExecutive Committee members is listed in Table ES.1. \nThe Committee talked to stakeholders, floated Deer Creek, identified stakeholder \nconcerns about Deer Creek, and then developed a watershed implementation plan of activities to \naddress a number of these concerns and water quality problems. The perceived problems and \nneeds are listed in Table ES.2. Plans for addressing these problems and needs are listed in \nTable ES.3. Other concerns will be addressed in later revisions to the implementation plan. \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \nii \n \n \n \nTable ES.1.

\n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n2-1 \n2.0 DEER CREEK WATERSHED \n \n2.1      Watershed      Description      \nDeer Creek is a 159-mile waterway that extends from Lake Bolivar in Bolivar County \nthrough Washington, Sharkey, and Issaquena counties, before entering Warren County and \nflowing into Whittington Auxiliary Channel near Vicksburg. This Watershed Implementation \nPlan (WIP) initially focuses on the upper Deer Creek watershed. \nThe upper Deer Creek watershed extends from Lake Bolivar to Rolling Fork, and drains \napproximately 71,000 acres of the Yazoo River Basin in portions of Bolivar, Washington, and \nSharkey counties in western Mississippi (Figure 2.1) (MDEQ 2003a, DeLorme 1998). \nApproximately 12,000 people lived in this watershed in 2000 (based on Census 2000, county \ndata). Portions of the cities of Leland, Arcola, Hollandale, Metcalfe, and Rolling Fork are in the \nupper Deer Creek watershed. Agriculture is the primary land use in the upper Deer Creek \nwatershed, with 84% cropland and 5% pasture (Figure 2.2). \nThe watershed is underlain by alluvial deposits of sand and clay. The topography of the \nwatershed is mostly flat, with river terraces and levees providing the main topographic relief \n(MDEQ 2000). Dundee-Bosket-Beulah-Souva is the major soil association in the watershed \n(Morris 1961). Soils in this association are nearly level, somewhat poorly drained to \nwell-drained, silt loam and sandy loam soils formed on old natural levees. The watershed is \nlocated in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain ecoregion (MDEQ 2000). Native vegetation in the \nwatershed consists of bottomland hardwoods (oak, gum, cottonwood, and cypress) (MARIS \nonline map accessed June 24, 2004). \n \n \n\n \n \n \n2-2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.1. Deer Creek watershed. \n\n \n \n \n2-3 \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.2. Land use in Deer Creek watershed. \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n2-4 \nNamed creeks in the watershed include Deer Creek, Otter Bayou, East Branch, and \nWilliams Bayou. There are two lakes in the upper Deer Creek watershed, Lake Bolivar and Saw \nGrass Lake. Numerous smaller impoundments and oxbow lakes are present in the watershed \n(DeLorme 1998). At Rolling Fork, a large portion of Deer Creek flow is diverted to Rolling Fork \nCreek (MDEQ 2003a). Approximately 5,200 acres of wetlands occur along upper Deer Creek. \nWater levels in the creeks and wetlands are maintained by the shallow alluvial aquifer that \nunderlies the watershed. Public water supply is primarily provided from deep confined aquifers \nthat are generally protected from contamination. Water for agricultural uses (e.g., irrigation) is \nprimarily drawn from the shallow alluvial aquifer (MDEQ 2000). \n \n2.2      Water      Quality      \n2.2.1   Standards   \nThe designated use class for all perennial surface waters of this watershed, as stated in the \nMississippi water quality regulations, is Fish and Wildlife Support. The designated beneficial \nuses for these waters are Aquatic Life Support and Secondary Contact Recreation \n(http://deq.state.ms.us/MDEQ.nsf/page/WMB_yazoodesignate?OpenDocument). Portions of \nDeer Creek are also permitted for irrigation withdrawal. Table 2.1 lists the numeric water quality \ncriteria applicable to Deer Creek watershed surface waters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2.1. Water quality criteria for Deer Creek watershed. \n \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature                  32.2ºC                  \nFecal coliform \nMay – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per 100 mL less \nthan ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30-day period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, 4000 per 100 mL \nless than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30-day period. \nSpecific conductance    1000 μohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n2-5 \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural, or other \ndischar\n\nges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, sediment, turbidity, \nor other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the waters injurious to public \nhealth, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife, or adversely affect the palatability of fish, \naesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated use” (MDEQ 2002). \n \n2.2.2   Current   Condition   \n2.2.2.1 Surface Water Quality \nThere is a Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) ambient \nmonitoring site on Deer Creek at Hollandale. A number of other agencies have conducted water \nquality studies on Deer Creek. In the early 1970s, Deer Creek was sampled during pollution \nstudies on the Big and Little Sunflower Rivers by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, \nFisheries and Parks (MDWFP) and Mississippi Game and Fish Commission. More recent water \nquality sampling (in the 1990s and 2000s) has been conducted by MDEQ, the Yazoo-Mississippi \nDelta Joint Water Management District, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) \nAgricultural Research Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United \nStates Geologic Survey (USGS). Information on the sampling dates and parameters sampled by \nthe various agencies at various locations on Deer Creek is provided in the Yazoo River Basin \nCompendium of Water Quality Information (MDEQ 2003) and in the sediment/siltation, organic \nenrichment/low dissolved oxygen (DO), and nutrients total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for \nDeer Creek (MDEQ 2003a). \nTwo segments of Deer Creek (MS407M1 and MS403M6) and a portion of the Deer \nCreek watershed associated with segment MS402E have been classified as impaired and \nincluded on the Mississippi 303(d) list. Table 2.2 lists the designated uses that were classified as \nimpaired, the listed causes of the impairments, and the year the impairment was identified. \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n2-6 \nTable 2.2.

The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard to \ngroundwater quality from either aquifer (MDEQ 2000). \n \n2.2.2.3 Wildlife Resources \nA number of  threatened or endangered species are listed for the counties of the upper \nDeer Creek watershed. These species are listed in Table 2.3. However, upper Deer Creek and its \nenvirons are significantly modified from natural conditions, and none of these federally listed \nspecies are known to occur in the area. There are also approximately 60 species of “special \nconcern” for the upper Deer Creek counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory \n(Appendix A) (http://www.mdwfp.com/museum/html/research/downloads.html). These species \nmay be present in the watershed and/or the surrounding area.

Four TMDLs have been completed \naddressing all but the 2006 listing of segment MS407M1. These TMDLs are described below. \nA Phase I TMDL addressing organic enrichment/low DO and biological impairment  in \nsegments MS403M6 and MS402E has been completed and approved by the United States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) (MDEQ 2003a). This was a Phase I TMDL because \nno data were available for calibrating the model to critical conditions (summer low flow). A 79% \nreduction in nonpoint sources of organic material was recommended in the TMDL. Table 2.4 \nlists the total biological oxygen demand (TBODu) TMDLs for Deer Creek (MDEQ 2003a). \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n2-8 \nTable 2.4.

This was a Phase I TMDL due to lack of flow data and \nfecal coliform measurements. Nonpoint pathogen sources were of primary concern in the listed \nstream segments. No percent reduction was developed in the TMDL study. However, the study \ndid recommend that the nonpoint load be reduced by eliminating failing septic systems and direct \npipes that discharge to Deer Creek (MDEQ 2003b). \nA TMDL addressing sediment from nonpoint runoff and in-channel processes in the \nupper portion of Deer Creek has been completed and approved by USEPA. The TMDL study \ndetermined that estimated sediment loads for Deer Creek were already within the range of \nestimated target sediment loads for the creek; therefore, no reduction in sediment load was \nrequired (MDEQ 2003c). \nThe pesticide impairments in Deer Creek were addressed in pesticide TMDLs for the \nYazoo River Basin (MDEQ 2003d, 2005). The target for these TMDLs was the removal of fish \nconsumption advisories for DDT and toxaphene and the reduction of water column \nconcentrations to the DDT human health and aquatic organism standards and the toxaphene fresh \nwater chronic standard. The methods proposed for achieving these targets included \nimplementation of best management practices (BMPs) to reduce sediment loading to water \nbodies (these pesticides are present in basin soils) (MDEQ 2003d) and natural attenuation \n(historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin has indicated a decreasing trend \nin pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ 2003d). \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n2-9 \n2.3      Stakeholder      Concerns      \nDeer Creek was selected for implementation of restoration activities based on its TMDLs \nand high level of stakeholder interest (MDEQ 2004b).

The goals and objectives of this plan reflect these \nprinciples. Each of these management principles is briefly described below, followed by \nwatershed management actions that are planned for the near future to work toward the vision for \nDeer Creek. Goals related to other existing or potential concerns in this watershed will be \naddressed in future implementation plans. \n \n3.1      Ecosystem-Based      Management      \nDeer Creek and its watershed represent the ecosystem management unit. Although Deer \nCreek is typically considered the ecosystem, a stream and its watershed cannot be divorced. Land \nuse and land cover activities in the watershed and surrounding areas directly or indirectly affect \nDeer Creek (e.g., there are fields located outside the Deer Creek watershed boundary that have \ndrains that discharge to the creek). Sediment and nutrient loadings from the lands along Deer \nCreek drive many stream processes, including both desirable and undesirable changes in the \nstream. The ecosystem, however, is characterized not only by its environmental attributes, but \nalso by its socioeconomic attributes. Humans are part of, not apart from, aquatic ecosystems. \nWatershed management is fundamentally a social activity (Thornton and Creager 2001; \nThornton and Laurin 2005). \nThe benefits that accrue from reduced sediment and nutrient loadings to Deer Creek are \nnot just associated with the stream in terms of increased water clarity, reduced sedimentation and \nloss of volume, reduced algal blooms, a more productive sport fishery, and greater recreational \nand aesthetic values. The agricultural community also benefits from reduced sediment and \nnutrient loadings. For example, Pimentel et al. (1995) estimated that each ton of sediment lost \nwas worth about $6.75 per year to the farmer ($5.00 per ton for lost nutrients, and $1.75 per ton \nfor lost soil and water capacity). Delta farmers are losing 1.4 to 2.8 tons of sediment per acre per \nyear in the Delta. For a 1,000-acre farm, this results in an economic loss of $9,450 to $16,200 per \nyear through soil erosion. \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n3-2 \n3.2 Adaptive Management Process \nIn addition to ecosystem-based management, an adaptive management process is being \nused for watershed management associated with Deer Creek. Adaptive management is “learning \nby doing” and has become the recommended approach for ecosystem and natural resources \nmanagement, including watershed management (Christensen et al. 1996; Holling 1978; Jackson \net al. 2001). Adaptive management has helped shift management from the concept that there is a \n“balance of nature” to a more realistic concept that ecosystems are dynamic, non-equilibrium \nsystems. The environment is continually changing – climate, development, agricultural practices, \ndemographics, and societal values. Adaptive management is the only feasible approach for \nmoving toward sustainable water resources (Coleman 1998). \nAdaptive management, or learning by doing, means that periodic assessments must be \nmade to determine if results-based criteria (e.g., decreased pesticides in fish) are being attained \nand if the stream is moving toward the desired vision for Deer Creek. The schedule for these \nperiodic assessments and revision of the watershed management plan is discussed in Section 5. \nThe rotating basin approach used by MDEQ is part of this periodic assessment process. \n \n3.3      Management      Actions      \nThe goals for this watershed implementation plan stem from the stated mission to \nimprove the quality of life for people who live near and visit Deer Creek through effective \nstewardship. In fulfilling this mission, the following goals are set for this implementation plan: \n \n• Ensure Deer Creek attains water quality standards to protect human health and \ndesignated uses; \n• Restore instream and riparian habitat in Deer Creek and its watershed; and \n• Improve and manage Deer Creek and its watershed so it contributes to an \nimproved quality of life (health, jobs, economy, education, recreation, aesthetics, \nand spirituality) for all who experience it. \n \nPlanned management actions for achieving these goals fall within six general categories, \ndiscussed below: \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n3-3 \n1.         Health         Hazards;         \n2.         Erosion         and         Sedimentation;         \n3. Pollutants (in water, sediment, fish, and plants); \n4.         Water         Quantity;         \n5. Recreational Opportunities; and \n6.         Socioeconomic         Development.         \n \nFor each category, there is a general introduction followed by a table(s) that provides \ninformation on the specific management action, its objective(s) and benefit(s), participants \ninvolved in implementing the management activity, their role and responsibility, the schedule, \nand estimated budget. Note that values shown for load reductions, number of management \npractices to be installed, and costs are planning estimates and subject to change. \n \n3.3.1   Health   Hazards   \nThe concerns raised by the stakeholders that have been categorized as health hazards \ninclude failing septic systems, direct discharge of untreated sewage into Deer Creek, E. coli and \nother pathogens, and West Nile virus and other mosquito problems. There are two management \nactions planned that address the sewage-related health issues: \n \n• A survey of Deer Creek to identify locations of  failing septic systems and direct \nsewage discharge pipes, and \n• Repair of failing septic systems. \n \nEach of these management actions is briefly discussed below and then highlighted in \nTables 3.1 and 3.2. In addition, a Sewage Summit to inform municipal and county officials, \ninstallers, and residents about decentralized and onsite sewage treatment systems is planned as an \neducation and outreach action to address sewage-related health issues. The Sewage Summit is \ndescribed in detail in Section 4.0. \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n3-4 \n1. Deer Creek Survey \nAn important first step for most restoration work in the Deer Creek watershed is \ndetermining specific sites in need of restoration. An initial survey has been conducted (see \nSection 2.3). A more detailed survey is warranted before implementation of restoration practices. \nThis survey will encompass the entire length of Deer Creek. An initial review of the \nwatershed will be made using aerial photographs flown within the last 2 years and information \ngathered during the March 2006 survey and from stakeholders. From this initial review, locations \nwill be identified for confirmation and in-depth investigation during the detailed survey. Lastly, \ntwo survey teams will be put together to characterize Deer Creek from Lake Bolivar to Rolling \nFork. The survey teams will employ USEPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocols, Natural Steam \nChannel Design procedures, or similar hydraulic/physical habitat protocols for the survey. Teams \nwill characterize stream bank erosion and fishery habitat and record GPS coordinates. They will \nalso record GPS coordinates of all inflows to Deer Creek, that could be possible sources of \nnutrients, organic material, and/or pathogens. Conditions will also be documented with \nphotographs. The teams will prepare survey reports to be used to plan restoration activities in \nDeer Creek (Table 3.1). \n \n2. Fix Failing Septic Systems and Direct Discharges \nAerial photography will be used to identify locations of potentially failing septic systems. \nThese locations will then be evaluated on the ground to determine their status. When fail\n\ning \nsystems are identified, MSDH will provide landowners with information on repair options. \nMSDH will follow up to ensure that failing systems are replaced or repaired (Table 3.2). \nAssuming daily per capita loads of 50 gallons/person/day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen \ndemand (CBOD), 10 gallons/person/day total nitrogen, 3.5 gallons/person/day total phosphorus, \nand 12 x 10\n8\n fecal coliforms/person/day from the failed systems (USEPA 1980), and that each \nsystem serves two people, fixing one failing septic system would be estimated to result in the \nreduction of approximately 80 lbs per year of oxygen demand, 16 pounds/year of nitrogen, \n5 pounds/year of phosphorus, and 9 x 10\n11\n fecal coliforms/year. This is consistent with TMDL \nrecommendations for reducing organic matter loading to Deer Creek (Table 2.4). \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n3-5 \n3.3.2   Erosion and Sedimentation \nErosion in Deer Creek and on the adjacent lands can lead to sedimentation in Deer Creek. \nErosion and sedimentation affect both the aquatic and riparian (stream bank) habitat associated \nwith the creek. Four management actions are planned to address erosion and sedimentation: \n \n1. Fixing head-cuts and failed culverts, \n2.         Bank         stabilization,         \n3. Aquatic weed control training, \n4. Implementation of agricultural BMPs, \n5. A Deer Creek survey. \n \nThese actions address the goals of Deer Creek by attaining water quality standards and \nachieving designated uses, restoring instream and riparian habitat, and improving quality of life. \nThe Deer Creek survey was described in Section 3.3.1. The other management actions are briefly \ndiscussed below and highlighted in Tables 3.3 through 3.6, located at the end of Section 3.0. \n \n1. Fix Head-Cuts and Failed Culverts \nThere are drainage canals in crop fields adjacent to Deer Creek that drain to the creek and \nare currently subject to head-cutting. Erosion of head-cuts can be a significant source of \nsediment that could end up in Deer Creek. Section 319 grants can be prepared to fund part of the \ncost of fixing head-cuts identified during the survey (Section 3.3.1). \nSome culverts in the Deer Creek watershed have collapsed and now serve as \nimpediments to, rather than conduits for, flow under field roads. These culverts need to be \nremoved and replaced. These failed culverts can result in downstream erosion, bank instability, \nand increased upstream sedimentation. Section 319 grants can be prepared to fund part of the \nreplacement of failed culverts identified during the survey (Section 3.3.1). Activities associated \nwith this management action are highlighted in Table 3.3. \n \n2.        Bank        Stabilization        \nSedimentation in Deer Creek can arise both from soil erosion in the watershed and bank \nerosion in the stream. Bank instabilities contribute not only to water quality degradation, but also \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n3-6 \nto loss of habitat for aquatic organisms. Bank stabilization is required both for habitat and water \nquality improvement. Section 319 and NRCS Wildlife Habitat Improvement Program (WHIP) \nare candidates for proposals to fund bank stabilization efforts at sites identified during the survey \n(Section 3.3.1). Activities associated with this management action are highlighted in Table 3.4. \n \n3. Aquatic Weed Control Training \nAquatic weeds often occur in Deer Creek at locations subject to sedimentation. Once \naquatic weeds become established, they can further impede flow and promote sedimentation. \nThey are generally considered undesirable in those areas of Deer Creek that flow through \ncommunities. Not all aquatic plants are weeds, and some aquatic plants provide habitat for fish \nand other aquatic organisms. However, these communities lack the expertise to know what plants \nare undesirable (weeds) and how to control or get rid of them. Therefore, it would be beneficial \nto provide training on this subject to community leaders and employees. Activities associated \nwith this management action are highlighted in Table 3.5. \n \n4. Implementation of Agricultural BMPs \nThe sediment TMDL completed for Deer Creek indicated that reductions in sediment \nload from the watershed were not needed. However, a number of farms operating adjacent to \nDeer Creek recognize that they are experiencing significant soil loss from their fields, and some \nof this eroded material is deposited in Deer Creek. Potential sites for BMPs such as water control \nstructures, seasonal residue management, buffer zones, land forming, and tree planting will be \nidentified during the Deer Creek survey and by local land owners. Implementation of these \nand/or other BMPs will address erosion and sediment transport from individual fields to Deer \nCreek. In addition, sediment BMPs will reduce organic material and pesticide runoff and loading \nto Deer Creek from these fields. Activities associated with this management action are \nhighlighted in Table 3.6. \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n3-7 \n3.3.3   Pollutants   \nThe primary pollutants of concern in Deer Creek are nutrients, organic material, and \npesticides. Nutrients and organic material are suspected of contributing to low DO conditions in \nDeer Creek. Potential sources of nutrients and organic material to Deer Creek include untreated \nsewage and fertilizers in field runoff and drain effluent. \nIn the past, pesticides have been measured in Deer Creek fish at levels above those \nconsidered safe for human consumption. Some data collected in the Delta suggest that pesticide \nlevels in fish are declining, however, there is no recent data from Deer Creek to confirm that \npesticide levels are declining and/or have reached safe levels, in the Deer Creek sport fish \npopulation. In addition, there is concern that pesticides stored in Deer Creek sediments may act \nas a source for continued fish contamination. Again, no recent data are available characterizing \npesticide levels in Deer Creek sediments. \nThree management actions are planned to address these concerns: \n \n1. A Deer Creek fish tissue survey, \n2. A Deer Creek sediment pesticide survey, and \n3. Implementation of agricultural BMPs. \n \nThese actions address the goals of Deer Creek attaining water quality standards and \nachieving designated uses, restoring instream and riparian habitat, and improving quality of life. \nReducing sewage and organic material loading was discussed in Section 3.3.1. Implementation \nof agricultural BMPs for reducing sediment, nutrients, and pesticides was described in \nSection 3.3.2. The other management actions are briefly discussed below and highlighted in \nTables 3.7 and 3.8, located at the end of Section 3.0. \n \n1. Deer Creek Fish Tissue Survey \nCarp, buffalo, gar, and large catfish in Deer Creek are included in the Delta fish \nconsumption advisory for DDT and toxaphene. There is interest in obtaining a more complete \npicture of the levels of DDT and toxaphene in Deer Creek game fish prior to providing increased \nfishing access to, or promoting fishing in, Deer Creek. Therefore, a fish tissue sampling survey is \nplanned. \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n3-8 \n2. Sediment Pesticide Survey \nDeer Creek sediments are a potential source of pesticides for fish tissue contamination in \nthe system. Ensuring the human health safety of the Deer Creek fishery requires evaluation of \npotential sources of contamination. This action addresses the fishable (including fish \nconsumption) designated use for Deer Creek and the suitability of the habitat to produce fish that \nare safe to eat. \n \n3.3.4   Water   Quantity   \nMaintaining a minimum flow in Deer Creek can improve water quality and fish habitat, \nand enhance the aesthetics of the creek. Currently parts of Deer Creek are dry during late \nsummer (August). Determining the minimum flow for Deer Creek is the current planned \nmanagement action for this category. This management action is described in detail below and \nhighlighted in Table 3.9. \n \n1. Establish Minimum Stream Flow \nDeer Creek is part of the state's water supplies available for out-of-stream beneficial use \n(e.g., irrigation). Water withdrawals for beneficial use should be managed under the regulations \nestablished by MDEQ. There are currently several active permits for water withdrawals from \nDeer Creek. A minimum flow needs to be established for Deer Creek to provide both for \npermitted withdrawals and aquatic life support. \n \n3.3.5   Recreational   Opportunities   \nProviding opportunities for recreation associated with Deer Creek can improve quality of \nlife in the communities and area around the creek. Many stakeholders believe that increasing \nflow in Deer Creek (or maintaining a minimum flow) is the first step in increasing recreational \nopportunities associated with the creek. Stakeholders are also interested in developing or \nimproving fisheries for catfish, crappie, bass, and bream in Deer Creek to increase recreational \nopportunities. Planned management actions for increasing recreational opportunities include: \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n3-9 \n1. Developing walking trails along Deer Creek in Metcalfe, Rolling Fork, \nHollandale, and Leland; \n2. Developing boat ramps on Deer Creek in Hollandale and Metcalfe; \n3. Developing information for a driving/cycling tour of local historical sites and/or a \nfloat tour of Deer Creek; and \n4. Establishing minimum stream flow for Deer Creek (see Table 3.9). \n \nThe issue of increasing flow in Deer Creek was discussed in detail in Section 3.3.4. The \nremaining management actions are discussed below and highlighted in Tables 3.10 through 3.12. \n \n1. Develop Walking Trails Along Deer Creek \nThe towns of Metcalfe, Rolling Fork, Hollandale, and Leland are interested in developing \nwalking nature trails along Deer Creek in their communities. Several of these communities \ncurrently own property along Deer Creek on which trails could be developed. The details of this \nmanagement action are highlighted in Table 3.10. \n \n2. Develop Boat Ramps on Deer Creek \nNo developed access currently exists on Deer Creek. The towns of Metcalfe and \nHollandale are interested in developing public access (i.e., boat ramp) to Deer Creek in their \ncommunities. Having two public access points will make it easier to canoe/float Deer Creek, and \nprovide additional opportunities for recreation on Deer Creek. The details of these projects are \nhighlighted in Table 3.11. \n \n3. Develop Information for Self-Guided Tours of the Area \nThe land surrounding Deer Creek has many historical sites (e.g., plantations, Indian \nmounds) whose history is significant not only to the state of Mississippi, but also to the nation. \nInformation on these sites can be obtained from area historians and organizations such as the \nDelta State History Department, Vicksburg Military Park, and the Corps of Engineers, and \ncompiled into a document to be used for self-guided driving/cycling tours of the Deer Creek \narea. Markers would be installed at sites of interest. The Mississippi River Trail for Cyclists \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n3-10 \ncovers ten states from Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana. The \nMississippi River Trail enters Mississippi from Helena, Arkansas, on Highway 49, and travels \nclose to the river. In Washington County, cyclists travel on Highway 1 to Lake Washington and \nonto Mayersville where the Mississippi River Trail follows the levee almost to Eagle Lake. \nDetours from the trail to Deer Creek and associated communities could be promoted in these \nself-guided tour documents. \nA document could also be produced highlighting historical and natural sites encountered \nwhen boating Deer Creek. This document could include information about Deer Creek fisheries, \naccess, float characteristics, and other information useful to boaters and anglers, as well as \ninformation about the historical significance of Deer Creek. Brochures for drivers, cyclists, \nboaters, and anglers would provide additional recreational opportunities in the area. The details \nof this management action are highlighted in Table 3.12. \n \n3.3.6   Socioeconomic   Development   \nThe Mississippi Delta is classified as economically depressed. Management actions \nplanned along Deer Creek will improve quality of life and potentially create sustainable jobs in \nthe area. Improving the water quality and aesthetics of Deer Creek and reducing health risks \nassociated with the creek improves the quality of life along Deer Creek. Increasing recreation \nopportunities along Deer Creek also improves the quality of life in the area, but in addition, has \nthe potential to create sustainable recreation associated jobs (e.g., tour service, canoe shuttle, \nboat and tackle shop). Agri-tourism has already taken root near Rolling Fork, with a fall \nPumpkin Patch and Corn Maze in conjunction with the Great Delta Bear Affair held in the fall. \nAll of the planned management actions have the potential to contribute to socioeconomic \ndevelopment along Deer Creek. \n\nTable 3.1.

The goal of community education along the Deer Creek corridor is to develop an \natmosphere that promotes sustained, long-term restoration, stewardship, and protection of Deer \nCreek natural resources. In addition to the numerous state and federal agency education efforts \ncurrently ongoing at the county level, the following additional education and outreach actions are \nplanned to benefit the Deer Creek corridor and are described below: \n \n1. Washington County Sewage Summit, \n2. Deer Creek signage project \n3. Deer Creek Clean-Up Days, \n4. Deer Creek essay contest, \n5. Deer Creek Christmas float contest, \n6.         Deer         Creek         website,         \n7.         Newsletter,         \n8.         Media         coverage,         \n9. Hire a watershed coordinator, \n10. Establish a Deer Creek environmental education coordinator or education and \noutreach committee, and \n11. Establish and populate a Deer Creek information repository. \n \n4.1 Washington County Sewage Summit \nMany property owners are unaware of requirements instituted by MSDH, MDEQ, and \ncounties regulating the installation, inspection, and maintenance of onsite wastewater treatment \nsystems (septic and decentralized wastewater treatment systems). Many property owners are also \nunaware of the new technologies for treatment available to them as well as funding sources \navailable for cost-share on the purchase and installation of onsite systems. This Summit will \ninform property owners, local and state officials, and others about onsite, decentralized \nwastewater treatment systems and these options (Table 4.1; all tables included at the end of the \nsection). \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n4-2 \n4.2 Deer Creek Signage Project \nSigns along Deer Creek will increase awareness of improvements on Deer Creek and its \nimportance to local communities and their quality of life. Details of this management action are \nhighlighted in Table 4.2. \n \n4.3 Deer Creek Clean-Up Days \nMetcalfe, Leland, Arcola, Hollandale, Anguilla, and Rolling Fork held Clean-Up Days \nduring 2007 to encourage volunteers to clean up Deer Creek. This activity removed trash in the \ncreek and from its banks, improved Deer Creek’s public image, contributed to a sense of \ncommunity pride, and helped improve aquatic habitat. This action addressed all three of the plan \ngoals: attaining water quality standards, improving instream habitat, and improving quality of \nlife by improving aesthetics and reducing health hazards. This will be an annual event. Details of \nthis management action are highlighted in Table 4.3. \n \n4.4      Deer      Creek      Essay Contest \nIn 2007, the DCWA sponsored an essay contest in Deer Creek community schools with a \nprize of a $500 scholarship. The essay subject was “Why is Deer Creek Important?” This contest \nincreased awareness of the positive aspects of Deer Creek in the schools and the community at \nlarge. This will be an annual event to maintain interest in Deer Creek and the associated work to \naddress stakeholders concerns (Table 4.4). \n \n4.5 Deer Creek Christmas Float Contest \nIn 2007 the DCWA sponsored a Christmas float contest among the Deer Creek \ncommunity schools with a prize of $500 to the winning school. The 2007 float theme was \n“Conservation Keeps Us Afloat on Deer Creek.” The DCWA provided participating schools with \n$200 to help with the purchase of float construction materials. The floats were floated on Deer \nCreek. The contest and floats increased awareness of Deer Creek in the Deer Creek communities. \nThis will be an annual event, to maintain interest in Deer Creek and the associated restoration \nwork (Table 4.5). \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n4-3 \n4.6 Deer Creek Watershed Association Website \nA website could provide a convenient way to get information out to stakeholders, \nagencies, and other organizations interested in Deer Creek restoration (Table 4.6). \n \n4.7 Deer Creek Watershed Association Newsletter \nThis newsletter will serve as a vehicle to keep stakeholders informed about ongoing and \nplanned Deer Creek restoration work (Table 4.7). \n \n4.8      Media      Coverage      \nNews stories about restoration work on Deer Creek have been and will continue to be \nreleased to local TV and radio programs (e.g., Listen to the Eagle, Delta Day Break, Look \nAround Mississippi, and Delta Traveler), and local print media (e.g., Delta Magazine, Life in the \nDelta, Mississippi Outdoors, newspapers, newsletters). These news stories will address \nstakeholder concerns by increasing awareness of positive aspects of Deer Creek, and \nopportunities for community involvement (Table 4.8). \n \n4.9      Watershed      Coordinator      \nDCWA will work with various agencies and organizations to create a Watershed \nCoordinator position. This Watershed Coordinator will act as a liaison among the watershed \ncommunities and the agencies and groups active in the Deer Creek watershed. This was a need \nidentified by stakeholders. The Watershed Coordinator will also promote research on the \nhistorical significance of Deer Creek, educating the public, and improving Deer Creek’s public \nimage. This action addresses all three of the plan goals. Details of this management action are \nhighlighted in Table 4.9. Potential sources of funding to support the Watershed Coordinator \ninclude the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Entergy, MDEQ, USEPA, a Congressional \nearmark, and location individuals and businesses. \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n4-4 \n4.10    Environmental Education Coordinator \nStakeholders believe that establishing an environmental education coordinator would \ncontribute significantly to education and outreach activities in the Deer Creek area. However, \nthey believe that this action should be undertaken only after a watershed coordinator has been \nhired and established. Until an education coordinator can be hired, education and outreach \nactivities will be coordinated by an Education Outreach Committee formed of representatives of \nagencies involved in restoration work in the Deer Creek area and teachers from the schools along \nDeer Creek. The education coordinator/committee will serve as a liaison and resource for the \nagencies and groups involved in education and outreach in the Deer Creek communities. This \naction will address stakeholder concerns related to educating the public about Deer Creek, its \nimportance to the local communities, and the environmental concerns related to the creek. A \npotential funding source for this action is the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Table 4.10 \nsummarizes the details of creating the Education Outreach Committee. Activities associated with \nhiring or appointing an environmental education coordinator will be outlined in later updates of \nthe Deer Creek WIP. \n \n4.11    Deer Creek Information Repository \nHaving a single location/source for information about Deer Creek and the ongoing \nrestoration work in the watershed will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of education and \noutreach activities. This is a need that was identified by stakeholders. This action addresses \nconcerns related to educating the public about Deer Creek, the importance of Deer Creek to the \ncommunity, and the environmental concerns related to Deer Creek. The information available \nfrom this repository will assist in actions that address all three plan goals. See Table 4.11 for \ndetails of this management action. \n \n \n\nTable 4.1.

This information is \nsummarized in Table 5.2 for use in tracking and evaluating implementation of this plan. For \nimplementation to be considered successful, all activity milestones must be met on time. \nThe Implementation Team will meet quarterly to review progress on achieving the \nmilestones and make needed adjustments to the schedule. Each Team member serves as the chair \nfor one of the major management categories, such as health hazards, erosion and sediment, etc. \nThere is a subcommittee associated with each of these categories to ensure that the planned \nmanagement actions are implemented. \n \n5.2.1   Evaluation   of   Management   Actions and Education/Outreach \nActivities \nSpecific management action goals and/or expectations are described in Chapter 3. \nSpecific goals and/or expectations for education and outreach activities are described in \nChapter 4. If the activity goals are not met, the causes behind the failure to meet the goals will be \ndetermined. In addition, the plan activities will be evaluated with regard to information and \nknowledge about Deer Creek and its watershed that has been gained since the existing plan was \ndeveloped, as well as any relevant physical changes in the watershed or changes in policy \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n5-2 \naffecting Deer Creek. Implementation of the activities will be reevaluated in light of all of this \ninformation on a quarterly basis, as discussed above. \n \n5.3 Evaluation of Plan \nSpecific management action schedules toward achieving the vision for Deer Creek and its \nenvirons are described in Chapters 3 and 4 and summarized in Table 5.2. If the schedules are not \nbeing met, the causes behind the failure to meet the goals will be determined, and actions will be \ntaken. \n \n\nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 18, 2008 \n \n \n \n5-3 \n \n \n \nTable 5.1.
