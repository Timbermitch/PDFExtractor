The     \nwatershed  begins  near  the  Town  of  \nLumberton     in     southeast     Lamar     \nCounty  and  empties  into  the  Bay  of  \nSt.  Louis  north  of  the  City  of  Pass  \nChristian    near    the    Harrison    and    \nHancock   County   lines.      The   Wolf   \nRiver  Watershed  is  formally  identified  \nas  two  separate  sub-basins  within  the  Coastal  Streams  Basin.    These  two sub-basins \ninclude the Upper Wolf River (11-Digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 03170009080) and \nthe Lower Wolf River – Cane Creek (11-Digit HUC 03170009090).   \n \nThe Wolf River Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) is funded through a Section 319 \nWater Quality Grant from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). \nThe  purpose  of  the  Section  319  project  is  to  protect  water  quality  in  the  Wolf  River  \nWatershed  by  developing  a  WIP  and  conducting  other  activities  that  would  engage  \nstakeholders.  The primary focus of this plan is on public and stakeholder education with \na  goal  of  increasing  awareness  of  watershed  issues,  in  general  and  increasing  \nawareness  of  the  Wolf  River  Watershed,  specifically.    Although  the  plan  does  include  \nboth  technical  and  educational  strategies,  the  Section  319  Grant  only  includes  funding  \nfor implementation of selected educational strategies.  However, the technical strategies \ndiscussed in this plan include strategies and activities already being carried out by the \nWolf River Conservation Society (WRCS), its board members, and other interested and \ninvolved stakeholders.   \n \nT\n\nhe WRCS is a local, grassroots organization dedicated to preservation, conservation, \nmanagement, and protection of the Wolf River and its watershed from its headwaters in \nLamar  County  to  its  termination  at  the  Bay  of  St.  Louis,  Mississippi.    This  WIP  was  \nprepared  as  a  proactive  measure  to  prevent  future  pollution  of  the  watershed  and  to  \nmaintain  and  improve  the  current  water  quality  within  the  watershed.    The majority  of  \nactivities  and  strategies  proposed  herein  will  be  conducted  throughout  the  entire  \nwatershed  with  an  emphasis  on  a  comprehensive  approach  to  public  outreach  and  \neducation designed to reach both general and targeted audiences.  The implementation \nof the plan will be carried out by the Watershed Implementation Team (WIT) as led and \ndirected by the WRCS.  The WRCS assumes primary responsibility for the contractual \nobligations  with  the  MDEQ  and  will  direct  implementation,  evaluation,  review,  and  \nrevision activities.  The primary contact for the WRCS is: \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n2 \n \n \nWolf River Conservation Society \nMr. Robert F.

The   Wolf   River   \nWatershed  is  actually  comprised  \nof     two     distinct     watersheds     \ncommonly   referred   to   as   the   \nLower Wolf River Watershed and \nthe Upper Wolf River Watershed.  \nFor the purposes of this planning \neffort  and  implementation  efforts  \nto follow, the two sub-watersheds \nwill be referred to in the collective \nas   the   Wolf   River   Watershed.      \nDesignated      uses      of      the      \nwatershed are primarily recreational, and the Wolf River is one of few river systems in \nthe  State  of  Mississippi  that  is  not  overly  burdened  by  severe  water  quality  issues.    \nBecause  the  Wolf  River  drains  directly  to  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  via  the  Bay  of  St.  Louis,  \nmaintaining good water quality is critical not only for the river system itself but also for \nthe Bay and the Gulf. \n \nBecause  of  the  unique  characteristics  of  the  Wolf  River  Watershed,  it  has  been  \ndetermined  that  the  development  and  implementation  of  a  WIP  will  provide  specific  \nstrategies and a focused approach to maintain the high water quality standards that the \nWolf River now exhibits.  The development of the WIP involves the formation of a WIT.  \nThis WIT plays a critical role in the planning process by ensuring that the primary plan \nelements are selected based on a broad consensus.  The WIT is also the body that will \nwork  with  the  WRCS  to  ensure  plan  elements  are  implemented  according  to  the  WIP  \nand in a timely manner. \n \nThe  pages  to  follow  in  this  document  are  the  result  of  an  intensive  planning  effort \nundertaken by a large and diverse group of local, state, and federal stakeholders.  The \nplan references numerous organizations, agencies, and other stakeholders that played \na  critical  role  in  the  development  of  the  plan  and  the  strategies  contained  within  the  \nplan.  Many of these agencies and organizations are referred to in the plan document by \nacronym.  While efforts have been made to reduce the frequency of acronym usage, a \nFigure 1 – WOLF RIVER WATERSHED \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n5 \n \ntable  has  been  provided  as  Appendix  A  that  provides  a  guide  to  acronyms  and their \nmeanings. \n \nThe  Wolf  River  WIP  includes  multiple  components,  many  of  which  will  be  conducted  \nconcurrently.    These  components  include  planning,  public  education,  development  of  \nstrategies  for  water  quality  protection,  and  development  of  a  plan  for  continuous \nmonitoring  of  the  progress  of  the  implementation  of  the  plan.    Each  component  of  the  \nplan will play an integral role in the success of the established goals and objectives of \nthe  plan.    This  plan  is  the  sum  of  all  its  parts  and  should  be  viewed,  analyzed,  and  \nimplemented in a comprehensive manner in order for the implementation process to be \nfully successful. \n \n2.2 VISION STATEMENT \n \nThe  vision  of  the  Wolf  River  WIT  is  to  establish  a  watershed  management  framework  \ndesigned  to  protect  water  quality,  to enhance  and  protect  the  natural  resources  that  \nexist  within  the  watershed,  and  to  allow  the  entire  watershed,  as  a  natural  system,  to  \nfully  realize  its  potential  for  the  designated  water  uses  through  the  application  of  \neducation  measures,  sound  scientific  principles,  and  natural  resource  management  \npractices. \n \n2.3 MISSION STATEMENT \n \nThe mission of the WRCS and the WIT through this planning effort is to develop a WIP \nemphasizing  practices  designed to  assist  in  the  realization  of  the  WRCS’s  mission  to  \n“preserve,  conserve,  manage,  and  protect  the  Wolf  River  and  its  watershed  from  its  \nheadwaters in Lamar County to its termination at the Bay of St. Louis, Mississippi.”  This \nWIP  is  being  prepared  as  a  proactive measure  to  prevent  future  pollution  of  the  \nwatershed and to maintain and improve the current water quality within the watershed.  \nPotential  water  quality  impairment  issues  include  erosion,  sediment,  siltation,  litter,  \norganic  debris,  excess  nutrients,  suspended  solids,  and  pathogens.    Through  the  \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  this  plan,  the  WIT  will  promote  technical  and \neducational  best  management  practices  (BMPs) to  address  issues  of  concern  and  \npriority  areas.    The  goals  of  the  plan  will  be  achieved  through  a  combination  of  \nassessment,  education,  public  involvement,  targeted  management  actions,  and  land  \nconservation easements.    \n \n2.4 WATERSHED IMPLEMENTATION TEAM \n \nThe following entities are represented on the Wolf River WIT: \n \nMississippi Power \nWolf River Conservation Society \nWolf River Canoe & Kayak \nDuPont \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n6 \n \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Department of Wildlife & Fisheries \nMississippi Soil & Water Conservation Commission \nMississippi Museum of Natural Science \nLamar County Planning Department \n \nExecutive Committee (Wolf River Conservation Society) \n \nRobert Bass Ed Blakeslee Jane Dennis Frank DiGeorge \nBob Fairbank Joe Feil John Hairston Tracy Heggins \nTina Knoll Tom Milner Walter Morton Bob Occhi \nLenny Sawyer Dan Sloan Judy Steckler Bob Tannen \nBen Vance    \n \n \nTechnical & Education Committees \n \n \nBobby Ariatti Laura Beiser Mark Gilbert Micheal Hershman \nJoyce Hicks Art Kennard Chris Lagarde Lance Middleton \nCoen Perrott Cynthia Simmons Daniel Stuart Patrick Vowell \nJohn Walrod Melanie Walrod Andrew \nWhitehurst \n \n \n \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n7 \n \n3.0 WATERSHED DESCRIPTION \n \n3.1 O\nVERVIEW \n \nThe  Wolf  River  Watershed  is  a  sub-basin \nof   the   Coastal   Streams   Basin   and   is   \ncentrally    located    within    the    Coastal    \nStreams     Basin.          The     Wolf     River     \nWatershed  begins  with  Wolf  Creek  at  its  \nheadwaters  near  the  Town  of  Lumberton \nin  Lamar  County  and  extends  southward  \nthrough   five   counties   including   Lamar,   \nPearl River, Stone, Hancock and Harrison \nto its mouth at Bayou Portage and the Bay \nof  St.  Louis.    The  Wolf  River  Watershed  \nalso  includes  the  eastern  portions  of  the  \nCity of Poplarville.  The Wolf River Watershed encompasses approximately 367 square \nmiles   equating   to   approximately   235,052   acres.      The   Wolf   River   itself   includes   \napproximately  66  stream  miles  and  flows  through  land  that  is  predominantly  rural  in  \nnature.   \n \nThe Wolf River  became  part  of  the  State  of  Mississippi’s  Scenic  Streams  Stewardship  \nProgram on March 17, 2000 and was the first river in Mississippi designated through the \nScenic  Streams  Stewardship  Program.    The  Mississippi  Scenic  Streams  Stewardship  \nProgram was established as a voluntary program designed to encourage conservation \nand  stewardship  by  riparian  (stream-side)  landowners.    According  to  the  Mississippi  \nCode of 1972, Section 51-4-5, “The Legislature finds that certain selected streams and \nstream  segments  of  this  state  posses  unique  or  outstanding  scenic,  recreational,  \ngeological,  botanical,  fish,  wildlife,  historic,  or  cultural  values.    It  is  the  policy  of  the  \nLegislature  to  provide  for  the  protection  of  these  streams  and  to  conserve  the  state’s  \nnatural heritage for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations, while \npreserving the private property rights of riparian landowners.  There is a necessity for a \nrational balance between the use of these streams and the conservation of the natural \nbeauty  along  these  streams.    The  Legislature  finds  that  this  balance  will  be  best  \nachieved  through  a  nonregulatory  voluntary  stewardship  program  emphasizing  local  \neducation,  participation,  and  support.    The  primary  goal  of  the  program  is  to  maximize  \nvoluntary private conservation efforts and to build and maintain a sense of stewardship \namong  stream  users  and  riparian  landowners.    To  accomplish  this  goal,  the  program  \nmust  provide  a  nonregulatory  framework  to  obtain  cooperative,  voluntary  management  \nagreements  with  landowners  to  maintain  scenic  values  while  ensuring  the  rights  of  \nriparian landowners to continue customary uses along the stream.”   \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n8 \n \nThe goals of the WIP and the Scenic Streams Program closely align, and the benefits of \nthe   Wolf   River   being   a   part   of   the   Scenic   Streams   Stewardship   Program   will   \ncomplement the WIT’s efforts to implement this plan to its fullest potential. \n \nThe Wolf River is the largest and longest river in the Wolf River Watershed.

Harrison County has approximately 339 stream \nmiles within the watershed, followed by Hancock County with approximately 94 stream \nmiles,  Stone  County  with  approximately  88  stream  miles,  and  Lamar  County  with  \napproximately 31 stream miles.  \n \nTable 3.2 Named Waterbodies in the Wolf River Watershed \nName Area (in acres) County \nBig Swamp 285.65 Pearl River \nBonner Lake 19.27 Pearl River \nBrowns Lake 15.23 Stone \nCarrol Lake 15.23 Stone \nCrystal Lake 35.09 Stone \nHillsdale Lake 36.82 Pearl River \nHoliday Lake 60.05 Pearl River \nHorsehead Lake 3.95 Stone \nMorning Glory Lake 43.24 Hancock \nOrvisburg Lake 7.91 Pearl River \nRogers Lake 44.23 Stone \nSilver Run Lakes 66.47 Stone \n \n \n3.2 DEMOGRAPHICS AND PRIMARY LAND USES \n \nThe  Wolf  River  Watershed  reaches  into  five  counties  in  south  Mississippi  including:  \nLamar,  Pearl  River,  Stone,  Hancock,  and  Harrison.    General  land  uses  within  the  \nwatershed  are  primarily  rural  in  nature,  with  the  City  of  Poplarville  being  the  only  city  \nwithin  the  watershed  boundaries.    The  total  estimated  population  of  the  watershed  is  \n17,882 according to the 2000 U.S. Census.  The portion of the Watershed’s population \nresiding inside the City of Poplarville is 1,017 people.  Based on this breakdown of the \nWatershed’s  population,  only  about  5%  of  the  total  population  in  the  watershed  lives  \nwithin a municipality with the other 95% living in rural or unincorporated portions of the \nwatershed  counties.    An  analysis  of  data  from  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau’s  Population  \nEstimates  Program  from  the  base  year  of  2000  through  July  2008  indicates  that  \nHancock  and  Harrison  Counties’  populations  have  decreased  while  populations  in  \nLamar,  Pearl  River  and  Stone  Counties  have  increased.    Table 3.3  provides  an  \noverview of the population changes in the five watershed counties since 2000. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n10 \n \nTable 3.3 Population Change in Watershed Counties, 2000-2008 \n  \nHancock \nCounty, \nMississippi \nHarrison \nCounty, \nMississippi \nLamar \nCounty, \nMississippi \nPearl River \nCounty, \nMississippi \nStone \nCounty, \nMississippi \nTotal Population \n  \n1-Jul-08 \n40,140 178,460 49,121 57,466 16,025\n\n \n1-Jul-07 \n39,741 176,366 47,648 57,007 15,549 \n1-Jul-06 \n38,853 172,955 45,916 56,237 15,390 \n1-Jul-05 \n46,088 195,756 44,150 51,773 14,695 \n1-Jul-04 \n45,445 194,544 42,865 51,264 14,297 \n1-Jul-03 \n44,835 190,933 41,609 50,475 14,139 \n1-Jul-02 \n44,435 191,295 40,928 50,050 14,016 \n1-Jul-01 \n43,848 190,232 39,952 49,350 14,067 \n1-Jul-00 \n43,274 189,872 39,335 48,765 13,688 \nApril 1, 2000 (Estimates Base) \n42,969 189,606 39,068 48,619 13,622 \nApril 1, 2000 (Census 2000) \n42,967 189,601 39,070 48,621 13,622 \nPercent Change 2000 - 2009 -6.60% -5.90% 25.73% 18.19% 17.64% \nSource: US Census Bureau, Population Estimates Program \n \nAs indicated in Table 3.3, the populations of Hancock and Harrison Counties decreased \nat  6.6%  and  5.9%  primarily  dues  to  the  impacts  of  Hurricane  Katrina  as  evidenced  by  \nthe population change from July, 2005 – July 2006.  In similar fashion, the populations \nof Lamar, Pearl River, and Stone Counties have increased, with the largest increase of \n25.73%  seen  in  Lamar  County.    In  terms  of  management  of  the  watershed,  increased  \npopulation  in  Lamar,  Pearl  River,  and  Stone  Counties  have  the  potential  to  equate  to  \nincreased  development  pressures  in  the  upper  reaches  of  the  watershed  as  these  \ncounties  develop  in  an  effort  to  accommodate  increases  in  population.    It  is  also  \nassumed  that  as  hurricane  recovery  efforts  continue,  populations  in  Hancock  and  \nHarrison Counties will eventually return to and exceed pre-hurricane numbers.   \n \nOther  management  concerns  associated  with  demographic  trends  in  the  watershed  \nrelate  to  growing  populations  and  residential  development  in  rural  areas  located  in  the  \nupper  reaches  and  headwaters  of  the  watershed.    At  the  current  time,  none  of  the  \nwatershed  counties  have  centralized  wastewater  systems.    While  some  counties  may  \nhave scattered decentralized systems, the majority of new rural residential development \nwill  rely  on  single-lot  septic  systems  for  sanitary  sewer  disposal.    An  increase  in  the  \nnumber  of  septic  systems  in  the  watershed  has  the  potential  to  create  nutrient  related  \nwater  quality  concerns.    These  concerns  can  be  best  addressed  through  public  \neducation  targeting  these  residential  populations  and  through  the  promotion  of  more  \ntechnologically-advanced decentralized wastewater systems throughout the watershed. \n \nThe  predominant  land  use  throughout  the  watershed  is  rural,  undeveloped  land  \nclassified as bottomland hardwood forests, pine forests, farmlands, marshes, and other \nhabitats  typical  of  coastal  environments.    The  primary  improved  land  uses  in  the  \nwatershed include residential and light commercial activities.  Most commercial activity \nin  the  watershed  is  found  in  the  eastern  portion  of  the  City  of  Poplarville  within  the  \nboundaries of the watershed. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n11 \n \n \n3.3 PHYSICAL GEOLOGY \n \nThe Wolf River Watershed is located in the Pine Belt and Coastal Zone regions of the \nSouthern Coastal Plain and Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods land resource areas with the \nmajority  of  the  watershed  located  in  the  Pine  Belt  Region.    The  watershed  stretches  \nacross  three  primary  geological  formations  including  the  Citronelle  Formation,  the  \nPascagoula/Hattiesburg  Formation,  and  the  Coastal  Deposits  Formation.    The  Wolf  \nRiver  Watershed  includes  approximately  twenty-five  soil  associations  and  a  variety  of  \nspecific soil  types  typical  of  soils  located  throughout  the  Pine  Belt  and  Coastal  Zone  \nRegions.    A  map  depicting  primary  soil  associations  throughout  the  watershed  is  \nincluded in Appendix B and Table 3.4 provides specific information on the predominant \nsoil types located within the soil associations. \n \n \nTable 3.4 Primary Soil Types \nSoil Type % of Land Area Hydric Erosive \nAltmore Silt Loam 2% Yes Slight \nDorovan-Croation 2% Yes Slight \nHarleston Fine Sandy Loam 2% No Slight \nMalbis Fine Sandy Loam 2% No Slight to Moderate \nMalbis-Saucier 2% No Moderate \nMalbis-Susquehanna-Saucier 10% No Moderate \nMcLaurin Fine Sandy Loam 8% No Moderate \nMcLaurin-Lucy 2% No Slight \nMcLaurin-Smithdale 14% No Moderate \nPoarch Fine Sandy Loam 9% No Slight \nPonzer and Smithton 2% Yes Slight \nRuston Fine Sandy Loam 11% No Slight to Moderate \nSaucier Fine Sandy Loam 2% No Slight \nSaucier-Susquehanna 2% No Slight \nSmithdale Fine Sandy Loam 2% No Moderate \nSmithdale Sandy Loam 3% No Slight \nSmithton 7% Yes Slight \nSmithton Fine Sandy Loam 3% Yes Slight \nPercentages do not include surface water areas and soils of less than 2% of the total land area \n \nSoil  classifications  represented  in  Table  3.4 make  up  approximately  85%  of  the  \ngeographic  area  of  the  watershed  not  including  surface  water  areas.    In  terms  of  their  \nerosive index, these soils range from slight to moderate with approximately 16% of the \nsoil surface area of the top 85% of soils in the watershed classified as hydric. \n \n3.4 WETLANDS \n \nWetlands  are  defined  by  33CFR328 as  “areas  that  are  inundated  or  saturated  by  \nsurface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n12 \n \nnormal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in \nsaturated  soil  conditions.  Wetlands  generally  include swamps,  marshes,  bogs,  and  \nsimilar areas.”    Ecologically, wetlands provide a number of valuable functions including \nhabitat  and  foraging  opportunities  for  many  species  of  animals.    From  a  water  quality  \nperspective,  wetlands  provide  attenuation  of  floodwaters,  processing  of  nutrients,  and  \ninfiltration  of  stormwater,  all  of  which  improve  the  water  quality  of  the  respective  \nwatershed.   \n \nIn the  northern  portions  of  this \nwatershed,       wetlands       exist       \nprimarily    in    conjunction    with    \nstreams  and  are  often  located  in \nthe   floodplains   of   the   stream   \nchannels.  The dominant wetland \ntype  is  composed  of  bottomland  \nhardwood  forested  areas  along  \nstreams     and     in     floodplains.          \nSmaller  areas  of  emergent  and  \nshrub  type  wetlands  are  present  \nin   areas   where   shallow   water   \npools  for  extended  periods,  such  \nas  oxbows,  sloughs,  and  beaver  \nponds.  In  general,  the  wetland  areas  within  the  watershed  are  dominated  by  canopy  \nspecies  of  sweet  gum,  sweet  bay,  cypress,  tupelo  gum,  and  magnolia.    Loblolly  and  \nslash pines are found in wet flats within the watershed. \n \nThe Wolf River terminates at the Bay of Saint Louis.  A large, 2,426 acre Gulf Ecological \nManagement Site (GEMS) exists near the mouth of the Wolf River.  This preserve area \nis  managed  by  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Marine  Resources  (MDMR)  Coastal  \nPreserves Program and contains both tidal freshwater and brackish water marsh areas.  \nThese southernmost wetland areas are dominated by marsh plants such as sawgrass, \narrow  arum,  spike  rush,  and  pickerelweed.    The  marsh  areas  with  higher  salinity  also  \ncontain needle rush, duck potato, and big cordgrass.  \n \nTwo  types  of  wetland  management  activities  that currently  exist  in  the  watershed  \ninclude the GEMS preserve area and “Streamside Management Zones” (SMZs), which \nare   timber   harvesting   practices   encouraged   throughout   the   watershed.   Timber   \nproduction constitutes one of the major land uses in the watershed, and practices such \nas  clear-cutting  have  the  potential  to  result  in  significant  disturbance  of  soils  thus \nimpacting  water  quality.    SMZs  are  designed  to  protect  water  quality  of  streams  and  \nwetlands by limiting clearing of areas along streams and providing a buffer for managing \nrunoff  from  adjacent  disturbed  areas.  While  it  would  be  expected  that  an  increase  in  \nurbanization  would  lead  to  impacts  on  the  quantity  and quality  of  wetlands  within  the  \nwatershed; data does not exist to make a determination of impacts. \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n13 \n \n3.5 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AREAS \n \nThe  only  environmental  management  area  located  within  the  Wolf  River  Watershed  is  \nthe  Wolf  River  Coastal  Preserve  located  near  the  mouth  of  the  river  at  Bayou  Portage  \nand the Bay of St. Louis.  The Wolf River Wildlife Management Area is located adjacent \nto  the  watershed  boundaries  at  the  extreme  northwestern  end  of  the  watershed  but  \nexists primarily outside of the watershed boundaries.   \n \nThe Wolf River Coastal Preserve is part of the MDMR’s GEMS program.  GEMS is part \nof  a  coordinated  effort  between  the  U.S.  EPA,  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  Program,  and  the  \nMDMR  to  collect  information  about  Mississippi’s  coastal  wetland  areas.  Data  collected  \nis  available  on  the  internet.    The  GEMS  sites  in  Mississippi  are  also  Mississippi’s  \ndesignated   coastal   preserves.      The   Wolf   River   Coastal   Preserve   is   primarily   \ncharacterized  as  an  estuarine  and  tidal  freshwater  marsh  dominated  by  sawgrass,  \narrow  arum,  pickerelweed,  and  spike  rush  in  the  mid-section  of  the  river  segment  \nlocated  in  the  preserve.    The  lower  extent  of  the  river  near  DeLisle  Bayou  and  Bayou  \nPortage is dominated by needle rush with a mixture of duck potato and big cordgrass.  \nThis  area  provides  feeding,  resting,  and  wintering  habitat  for  several  migratory  bird  \nspecies  including  the  Brown  Pelican,  White  Pelican,  Osprey,  and  Cormorants.    Rare,  \nthreatened,  and  endangered  species  common  to  the  Wolf  River  Coastal  Preserve  \ninclude: \n \n• Mottled Duck • Osprey • Yellow Rail \n• Black Rail • Coastal Shiner • Diamondback Terrapin \n• American Alligator • Gulf Salt Marsh Snake • Southern Red Cedar \n \nLands  within  the  Coastal  Preserve  are  either  privately,  locally,  state,  or  federally–\nowned, with much of the property owned by the State of Mississippi.  The primary threat \nto the ecological integrity of the preserve is development of surrounding lands.  It is the \nintention  of  the  State  of  Mississippi  to  offset  these  threats  through  intergovernmental  \nand private cooperation in the management of the unique ecosystem that exists within \nthe Wolf River Coastal Preserve.\n1\n \n \n3.6 PARKS AND RECREATIONAL AREAS \n \nAn  analysis  of  available  GIS  data  indicates  the  presence  of  nineteen  facilities  located  \nthroughout the Wolf River Watershed.  These facilities are mixed in ownership and use \nwith  several  listed  as  owned  by  the  State  or  local  governments  and  others  listed  as  \nprivately  owned.    The  primary  concern  with  limited  parks  and  recreational  areas  is  the  \nlimited public access to the Wolf River and the Wolf River Watershed.  Limited access \nalso  tends  to  create  a  hindrance  to  education  and  outreach  efforts  by  limiting  the  \n“hands-on” personal experience that adds intrinsic and cultural value to the watershed.  \n                                            \n1\n    Mississippi    Department    of    Marine    Resources    GEMS    Sites:    www.dmr.state.ms.us/Coastal-\nEcology/GEMS/Wolf-River.htm.  \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n14 \n \nA listing of known parks and recreational areas is included in Table 3.5.

The survey was designed to gauge and quantify issues of concern, identify \ngeographic areas of concern, and reveal general attitudes of stakeholders towards the \nwatershed.    While  some  survey  questions  were  easily  quantifiable,  others  were  more  \nsubjective in nature and allowed for a wide range of responses.  Water quality concerns \ncommunicated  by  the  stakeholders  are  primarily  directed  towards  non-point  source  \npollution  issues.    Specific  non-point  source  pollution  issues  included  erosion,  siltation,  \nand pathogens.  In addition to general non-point pollution concerns, the survey revealed \nconcerns  associated  with  the  use  of  all  terrain vehicles  (ATVs)  and  the  presence  of  \ninvasive and non-native plant species in the watershed.   \n \nThe  survey  also  revealed  several  geographic  priority  areas  including  (1)  the  stretch  of  \nriver  from  Poplarville  to  Silver  Run,  (2)  areas  north  of  Highway  26,  (3)  the  Mill  Creek  \narea, (4) areas south of Interstate 10, and (5) unprotected areas in the Upper Wolf River \nWatershed.  Areas of general concern communicated by stakeholders were associated \nwith  those  geographical  areas  with  the  greatest  potential  for  new  development  within  \nthe watershed.  Areas such as Lamar County near Lumberton, Pearl River County near \nPoplarville,  and  areas  of  Harrison  County  south  of  I-10  will  likely  receive  the  greatest  \ndevelopment pressures in coming years.  Given these assumptions, stakeholders desire \nmeasures   designed   to   provide   protection   to   these   areas   prior   to   the   onset   of   \ndevelopment  activities.    The  following  sections  provide  specific  information  obtained  \nfrom the surveys and stakeholder meetings including specific responses to the survey.   \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n17 \n \n4.1 SURVEY RESULTS  \n \nIn  this  section,  the  survey  results  are  presented  graphically  where  appropriate,  and  a  \nnarrative is provided when graphic representation was not an option. \n \n \nWhat are the water quality concerns you have in this watershed? \n \nAs  the  graphic  above  shows,  one  of  the  main  areas  of  concern  for  impacts  to  water  \nquality  comes  from  erosion  and  sediment  due  to  land  development.    Forty-one \nresponses were given on this topic, with twelve of those listing general pollution topics \nsuch as  “non-point  source  pollution,  point  source  pollution,  pathogens,  and  excess  \nnutrients.”    The  remaining  responses  described  water  quality  concerns  related  to  \nrecreational such as ATV use and littering.  The forestry and wildlife concerns focus on \nprotection  of  riparian  forest,  preventing  invasive  plant  species,  and  destruction  of  fish  \nand wildlife habitat. \n \nWhat  do  you  consider  as  priority  areas  within  this  watershed  in  terms  of  \ngeography? Where are these priority areas located (specifically)? \n \nSurvey  results  provided  in  response  to  the  previous  questions  showed  the  greatest  \nconcern  lying  in  Pearl  River  County,  specifically  Poplarville  to  Silver  Run  –  North  of  \nHighway 26 and the Mill Creek area.  Other general areas of concern are areas north of \nHarrison  County  where  the  WRCS  does  not  hold  conservation  easements.    Some  \nstakeholders  felt  that  the  southern  end  of  the  watershed,  including  Harrison  County  \nrequired the most attention due to development pressures.   \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n18 \n \n \nWhat  are  the  pollution  issues  or  concerns  associated  with  identified  priority  \nareas?  \n \nIncreased  runoff,  sediment  and  siltation  were  concerns  expressed  throughout  the  \nwatershed.  The biggest concern associated with the northern portion of the watershed, \nincluding  the  headwaters  in  Lamar  County  and  all  of  Pearl  River  County,  is  leaking  \nseptic  tanks  and  pathogens.    Littering  and  industrial  dumping  were  also  mentioned  as  \nissues  in  the  northern  portion  of  the  watershed.    Nutrient  runoff  and  exotic  species  \ninvasion  was  presented  as  a  concern  for  areas  south of  Interstate  10.    A  total  of  14  \nresponses  were  given  to  this  prompt.    5  responses  were  related  to  pathogens  and  \nseptic  system  concerns  and  4  responses  were  related  to  se\n\ndimentation  and  siltation  \nwith the remaining responses related to various topics. \n \nWhat  do  you  consider  as  priority  areas  within  the  watershed  in  terms  of  \nsignificant water quality issues of concern, impacts of human activities, etc.? \n \nThe majority of the 15 responses related to stream bank protection from riparian forest \nremoval  and  channelization  and  the  subsequent  erosion  potential.    Litter  and  trash  \nremoval  was  mentioned  twice  as  were  specific  locations  (North  of  Interstate  10  in  \nHarrison County and Pearl River County).   Singular responses included concerns about \npathogens,   fish   and   wildlife   protection,   education   of   landowners,   land   owner   \ninvolvement and development hazards.    \n \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n19 \n \n \n \nDo  you  have  any  suggestions  regarding  best  management  practices  to  address  \nthe issues of concern in these priority areas? \n \nIn  response  to  this  question,  the  stakeholders  suggested  technical  strategies  with  \napproximately  the  same  frequency  as  educational  strategies.    The  technical  strategies  \ninclude  water  quality  testing,  conservation  easement  acquisition,  riparian  BMPs  for  \nforestry,  bank  stabilization,  wetland  and  floodplain  restoration,  and  establishment  of  \ngreen  belts.    The  survey  results  suggest  that  the  stakeholders  would  like  to  see  \nincreased  education  on  the  current  protection  laws.    Other  educational  suggestions  \ninclude  a  wildlife  conservation  awareness  program,  public  signage  at  basin  crossings,  \nsignage at public access points, educational nature hiking trails, and river conservation \neducation   programs   for   schools   and   tourism.   On   the   enforcement   side,   stricter   \nenforcement   of   water   quality   protection   laws   and   stormwater   containment   from   \nconstruction sites were listed as suggested BMPs.   \n \nDo    you    have    any    suggestions    regarding    water    quality    and    watershed    \nmanagement education needs within the Wolf River Watershed?  \n \nThis  question  provided  results  relating  to  specific  audiences  for  education  such  as  \ndevelopers,  landowners,  and  people  who  use  the  river  for  recreation.    The  specific  \nstrategies  suggested  in  the  survey  results  include  school  and  children’s  outreach  \nprograms,  signage  to  promote  the  Wolf  River  as  a “scenic  stream”  and  a  media  \ncampaign to include newspaper, magazines, television and the internet. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n20 \n \n \nWhat do you value most about the Wolf River Watershed? \n \n• Excellent example of a black water stream; \n• Scenic value; \n• It is a pristine, unpolluted stream located in an urban area; \n• The quality of water and wildlife; and \n• Opportunities for recreation: nature hikes, swimming, canoeing, camping, a cure for \n“Nature Deficit Disorder” \n \n4.2 RESOURCE RANKINGS AND POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS \n \nThe   MDEQ   recently   developed   the   Mississippi   Watershed   Characterization   and   \nRanking  Tool  (MWCRT)  for  use  by  planners,  scientists,  and  other  environmental  \nprofessionals  to  determine  the  relative  value  of  watersheds  within  the  State  based  on  \nthe   presence   of   important   natural   resource features.      The   MWCRT   utilizes   a   \ncombination of spatial attributes placed into categories to determine their resource value \non  the  environment,  their  impacts  on  human  welfare,  and  the  presence  of  potential  \nstressors within the watershed.  The spatial attributes contained in these categories are \nused to generate values that are normalized and weighted to produce a final score and \nranking for each watershed.  The MWCRT was used in development of the Wolf River \nWIP as a comparison to resource values, issues, and concerns communicated through \nthe survey.   \n \nTable  4.1  provides  an  overview  of  stakeholder’s  perceived  problems  and  specific  \ngeographic locations of concern as communicated through the stakeholder survey.  The \nMWCRT  was  used  in  this  instance  to  compare  stakeholder  concerns  with  quantified  \nresource values and concerns based on known attributes and spatial data.  Generally, \nthe  MWCRT  supports  the  perceptions  communicated  in  the  stakeholder  survey  and  \nlends validity to the overall perceived value of the Wolf River Watershed and concerns \nthat have potential to impact water quality in the watershed. \n \nTable 4.1 Stakeholders’ Perceived Stressors \nIssue Geography Suspected Stressor or Cause \nSiltation and Erosion Pearl River County Unauthorized ATV use \nSiltation and Erosion Pearl River County Increases in development activity \nPathogens Entire Watershed Failing septic tanks \nNutrients Mill Creek Area Agricultural Activities \nSiltation Upper Watershed Unregulated and unprotected activities \nInvasive species Entire Watershed Removal of Native Species \n \nThe MWCRT evaluates basins based on sub-watershed categories indicated by 12-digit \nHUC codes.  Data provided through the MWCRT for the Coastal Streams Basin covers \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n21 \n \nall   fifty-six   sub-watersheds   within   the   basin   including   the   eight   sub-watersheds \ncomprising  the  Wolf  River  Watershed.    Each  12-digit  HUC  code  sub-watershed  was  \nscored based on a number of factors as indicated below.  The scoring for each category \nconsidered was then evaluated to provide a ranking for each 12-digit HUC.  Each sub-\nwatershed is ranked 1 through 56 based on their environmental resource values, human \nwelfare  resource  values,  and  potential  stressors.    In  general  terms,  the  lower  the  \nnumbered  ranking,  the  higher  the  potential  is  for  that  particular  12-digit  HUC  to  have  \neither significant resources or potential stressors.  The sub-categories of data contained \nwithin the three broad categories are listed in Table 4.2 below: \n \n \nTable 4.2 Mississippi Watershed Characterization and Ranking Criteria  \nEnvironmental Resource Values  \n Endangered Species \n Bottomland Hardwood Forests \n Estuarine Emergent Wetlands \n Estuarine Woody Wetlands \n Palusturine Emergent Wetlands \n Pine Savannahs \n Swamps \n Freshwater Shrub/Scrub Wetlands \n Palusturine Non-vegetated Wetlands \n Wildlife Management Areas \n National Wildlife Refuges \n National Forests \n Lakes \n Perennial Streams \nHuman Welfare Resource Values  \n Recreation Lakes \n Recreation Streams \n Public Waterways \n National Parks \n State Parks \n Recreation Locations \nPotential Stressors  \n Non-Riparian \n Erosion Potential \n Impervious Surfaces \n Nutrient Potential \n Livestock Operations \n \nAn evaluation of the data specific to the Wolf River Watershed was conducted utilizing \nthe MWCRT, which is provided in this document as Appendix C. The following sections \nprovide a description of the values and stressors evaluated in the MWCRT. \n \n \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n22 \n \n \n4.2.1  ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE VALUES \n \nThe  MWCRT  uses  measurable  and  quantifiable  attributes  to  establish  environmental  \nresource values.  These attributes include the presence of a variety of wetlands types, \nwater  features,  and  other  resources  such  as  established  wildlife  management  areas,  \nwildlife  refuges,  and  national  forests  to  determine  overall  environmental  resource  \nvalues.   \n \n4.2.2  HUMAN WELFARE RESOURCE VALUES \n \nThe   Human   Welfare   Resource   Value   component   of   the   MWCRT   includes   an   \nassessment of attributes that have particular value to human activities in the watershed \nincluding the presence and value of recreational lakes and streams, public waterways, \nand public parks.   \n \n4.2.3  POTENTIAL STRESSORS \n \nThe  Potential  Stressors  component  of  the  MWCRT  analyzes  watersheds  based  on  a  \nseries  of  attributes  or  conditions  that  have  potential  to  negatively  impact  water  quality.    \nThese  attributes  include  erosion  potential;  the  presence  of  impervious  surfaces;  the  \npotential for imputation of nutrients from both agricultural and urban environments; and \nthe existence of livestock operations within the watershed.   \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n23 \n \n5.0 WATER RESOURCES \n \n5.1 H\nISTORY OF ACTIVITY IN THE WATERSHED \n \nHuman  activity  in  the  watershed  has  \nhistorically     consisted     of     sporadic     \nresidential      development      and      the      \ndevelopment    of    small    family    farm    \nsettlements.      In   more   recent   history,   \nland in the watershed has been used for \ntree  farming,  small  parcel  grazing  lands  \nand      other      agricultural      activities      \ncombined   with   recreational   activities   \nsuch   as   hunting,   fishing,   hiking,   and   \ncamping.    The  watershed  is  devoid  of  \nsignificant   urban   development   with   a   \nportion of the City of Poplarville being the only incorporated area of the watershed.   \n \nThe Wolf River holds the distinction of being the first river in the State of Mississippi to \nbe  designated  as  a  Scenic  Stream  through  the  State’s  Scenic  Streams  Stewardship  \nProgram.  The Mississippi Scenic Streams Stewardship Program was established as a \nvoluntary  program  designed  to  encourage  conservation  and  stewardship  by  riparian  \n(stream-side) landowners.  Through this designation, property owners in the watershed \nare  encouraged  to  voluntarily  adopt  practices  designed  to protect  the  river  and  to  \nmaintain the water quality of the river.   \n \nBecause   of   this   lack   of   urbanization   and   the   sparsely   populated   nature   of   the   \nwatershed, human activities have not yet had considerable impacts on the river channel \nand the water quality of the river and its tributaries.  Activities such as the acquisition of \nconservation  lands  and  the  designation  of  the  lower  portion  of  the  river  near  its  mouth  \nas  a  coastal  preserve  further  serve  to  enhance  and  protect  water  quality  in  the  Wolf  \nRiver.  However, there is a sense that the watershed and the river are becoming harder \nto protect due to increases in development activity and increases in population. \n \nEvidence of the impacts of these human activities is demonstrated in a Total Maximum \nDaily Load (TMDL) Report published by MDEQ in 2000 for fecal coliform in a segment \nof  the  Wolf  River.    The  Wolf  River  TMDL  addresses  a  thirty-one  mile  segment  of  the  \nriver from near Lizana from Cable Bridge Road to the mouth of the river at the Bay of St. \nLouis.    The  TMDL  report  indicates  the  presence  of  pathogens  exhibiting  as  fecal  \ncoliform in levels that exceed the maximum level allowed.  The report also attributes the \nprimary  source  of  fecal  coliform  to  septic  tanks  within  the  watershed  with  other  \ncontributing  factors  being  wildlife,  grazing  animals,  land  application  of  poultry  litter,  \nurban  development,  and  direct  inputs.    However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  at  a  point  \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n24 \n \nbetween 2000 and 2006, the Wolf River was de-listed from the State’s 303(d) impaired \nwaterbodies list.   \n \n5.2 I\nNTEREST IN THE WATERSHED \n \nThe Wolf River Watershed and \nthe   Wolf   River   are   unique   \ntreasures  in  south  Mississippi  \nand  contribute  to  the  region’s  \nheritage,  culture,  and  way  of  \nlife.  The Wolf River also helps \nto  solidify  the  coastal  region’s \ncultural connection to the water \nby  providing  a  link  from  inland  \nareas  of  the  region  to  the  Bay  \nof  St.  Louis  and  the  Gulf  of  \nMexico.        Interest    in    this    \nwatershed   extends   past   the   \nimmediate         region         into         \nneighboring  regions  and  states  \nthrough active participation in the WRCS.  Originally organized in 1998 with a mission to \nconserve, protect, and manage the Wolf River and its resources, the WRCS continues \ntoday to be a leader in promoting the watershed and engaging in activities designed to \nprovide further protection to the water quality and natural ecosystems that exists within \nthe  watershed.    At  the  present  time,  the  WRCS  is  over  150  members  strong  and  \ncontinues to be an advocate and a voice for the Wolf River and surrounding lands.   \n \nIn addition to activities undertaken by the WRCS, other groups have been active in the \nwatershed  including  Mississippi  Power  Company.    In  1993,  Mississippi  Power  began  \nefforts  to  collect  monitoring  data  in  the  Wolf  River  Watershed.    The  group’s  report,  \nfinalized and published in April, 2009, concluded that good water quality conditions exist \nthroughout  the  entire  66-mile  length  of  the  river.    Through  Mississippi  Power’s  efforts  \nand the combined efforts of other organizations such as the Soil Conservation Service \n(now the Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS), and the Wildlife Federation, \na  significant  amount  of  data  was  collected  at  twelve  monitoring  stations  established  \nalong  the  entire  length  of  the  river.    Data  collected  includes  stream  bottom  profiles,  \nwater temperature recordings, surface water chemistry, trace metals analysis of surface \nwaters, organic analysis of surface waters, organic analysis of river bottom sediments, \nand  water  quality  monitoring  including  monitoring  for  fecal  coliform  and  macroscopic  \nbenthic invertebrates.   \n \n5.3 WATER QUANTITY \n \nThe watershed is currently experiencing no shortage of surface or groundwater quantity.  \nAverage monthly stream discharge rates read from the USGS Stream Gauging Station \n02481510 near Landon, Mississippi and have remained relatively consistent throughout \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n25 \n \nthe study period from 1993-2008 with expected variations during seasonal wet and dry \nmonths.  Drinking water supply for the coastal region of Mississippi is sourced primarily \nfrom  groundwater  wells  reaching  into  deep  water  aquifers.    MDEQ  has  an  established  \nsource  water  protection  policy  that  applies  to  every  public  well  in  the  State.    An  \ninteractive map providing information on source water protection areas can be found on \nMDEQ’s    website    at    http://landandwater.deq.ms.gov/swap/onlinemaps/viewer.asp\n.  \nFactors typically affecting water quantity are primarily associated with land use, which is \nlargely rural in this watershed.  The rural land in the Wolf River Watershed is dominated \nby  forested  land,  farm  land  and  timber  production  and  is  generally  believed  not  to  \nimpact overall water quantity. \n \n5.4 WATER CONSERVATION \n \nLittle  effort  has  been  expended  towards  water  conservation  in  the  watershed  primarily  \ndue to the sparsely populated nature of the watershed and the resulting low demands in \nthe  watershed  for  potable  water  and  irrigation.    However,  a  statewide  effort  has  been  \nunderway to promote water conservation in households, businesses, and industry. \n \n5.5 WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES \n \nThe  Wolf  River  Watershed  is  characterized  by  the  diversity  of  aquatic  and  terrestrial  \nspecies.  The watershed provides habitat to a number of species including several listed \nas  rare,  endangered  and/or  threatened.    Protected  species  in  the  watershed  include:  \nDahoon  Holly,  Bog  Spice  Bush,  Chapman’s  Butterwort,  Southern  Butterwort,  coastal  \nshiner,  bluenose  shiner,  gopher  tortoise,  American  alligator,  rainbow  snake,  eastern  \ncoral snake, ribbon crayfish, and lavender burrowing crayfish.  Terrestrial species found \nin  the  watershed  include:  whitetail  deer,  turkey,  mink,  nutria,  otter,  beaver,  coyote,  red  \nwolf, raccoon, and bobcat.  The Wolf River and associated streams and tributaries are \nrich  with  a  diversity  of  aquatic  life  that  includes  approximately  ninety  documented  \nspecies of fish ranging from small shiners, minnows and chubs to larger game fish such \nas shadow bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, and channel catfish. \n3\n  \n \nNo  specific  fish  consumption  advisories  have  been  established  for  streams  in  the  \nwatershed  but  there  is  a  national  advisory  for  mercury  in  effect.    Due  to  the  relatively  \nunencumbered water quality found in the Watershed, the fishery appears to be in good \nhealth.  \n \nRecreational  activities  associated  with  identified  fish  and wildlife  species  is  primarily  \nrelated to hunting and fishing.  Since the majority of land is currently under protected or \nprivate ownership, the probability of issues associated with over-hunting or over-fishing \nare minimal. \n                                            \n3\n Mississippi Power Company, “Wolf River Preservation Project Environmental Monitoring Program: 1993-\n2008, 2009 \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n26 \n \n \nThreatened and Endangered Species By County\n4\n \nHancock Threatened Endangered Candidate \n \nLouisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus a. luteolus) \nLouisiana quillwort \n(Isoetes louisianesnsis) \nPearl darter (Percina \naurora) \n[Pearl River System] \n \nGopher Tortoise \n(Gopherus ployphemus) \nLeatherback turtle  \n(Dermochelys comacea) \n \n \nGreen turtle (Chelonia \nmydas) \nKemp’s ridley turtle \n(Lepidochelys kempii) \n \n \nLoggerhead turtle \n(Caretta caretta) \nWest Indian manatee \n(Trichechus manatus) \n \n \nInflated heelsplitter \n(Potamilus inflatus) \nBrown pelican (Pelecanus \noccidentalis) \n \n \nPiping Plover \n(Charadrius \npolyphemus) \n[Critical habitat] \n  \n \nGulf sturgeon \n(Acipenser oxyrhynchus \ndesotoi) \n[Critical habitat] \n  \nHarrison Threatened Endangered Candidate \n \nLouisiana Black Bear  \n(Ursus a. luteolus) \nKemp’s ridley turtle \n(Lepidochelys kempi\n\ni) \nBlack pine snake \n(Pituophis melanoleucus \nssp. lodingi) \n \nGopher Tortoise \n(Gopherus ployphemus) \nMississippi gopher frog \n(Rana capito sevosa) \n[Distinct vertebrate \npopulation] \n \n \nGreen turtle (Chelonia \nmydas) \nLouisiana quillwort  \n(Isoetes louisianesnsis) \n \n \nLoggerhead turtle  \n(Caretta caretta) \nAlabama red-bellied turtle \n(Pseuodomys \nalabamensis) \n \n \nGulf sturgeon \n(Acipenser oxyrhynchus \ndesotoi) \n[Critical habitat] \nLeatherback turtle \n(Dermochelys comacea) \n \n \nPiping Plover \n(Charadrius \npolyphemus) \n[Critical habitat] \nWest Indian manatee \n(Trichechus manatus) \n \n \n \nBrown pelican (Pelecanus \noccidentalis) \n \n \n Red-cockaded  \n                                            \n4\n http://www.fws.gov/southeast/jackson/ \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n27 \n \nwoodpecker (Picoides \nborealis) \nLamar Threatened Endangered Candidate \n \nLouisiana black bear  \n(Ursus a. luteolus) \nRed-cockaded \nwoodpecker (Picoides \nborealis) \nBlack pine snake –\n(Pituophis melanoleucus \nssp. lodingi) \n \nGopher Tortoise \n(Gopherus ployphemus) \n  \nPearl River Threatened Endangered Candidate \n \nLouisiana black bear \n(Ursus a. luteolus) \nLouisiana quillwort \n(Isoetes louisianensis) \nBlack pine snake \n(Pituophis melanoleucus \nssp.

Based  on  the  2008  \nMississippi  305(b)  Water  Quality  Assessment  Report,  the  Wolf  River  and  associated  \nstreams  are  currently  classified  as  attaining  their  designated  uses.    This  data  reveals  \nthat  water  quality  in  the  watershed  is  generally  good.    However,  there  are  potential  \nthreats  to  the  current  status  of  water  quality  in  the  watershed  that  include  future  \nurbanization,  agricultural  and  silvaculture  activities,  improper  ATV  use,  and  pathogens  \nassociated with failing septic systems.   \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n28 \n \n5.6.2 Designated Use Classifications and Water Quality Standards \n \nAll  water  bodies  within  the  Wolf  River  Watershed  have  a  designated  use  classification  \nas Aquatic Life Support and Recreation.  Based on the 2008 State of Mississippi 305(b) \nWater  Quality  Assessment  Report,  all  watershed  streams  identified  in  the  report  are  \ncurrently meeting standards for use. \n \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n29 \n \n6.0 WATERSHED TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES \n \n6.1 O\nBJECTIVES \n \nThe primary objectives of the technical management activities as outlined in this section \nare to increase the level of data and technical knowledge of human activities within the \nwatershed;  to  provide  a  basis  for  monitoring  of  environmental  conditions  within  the  \nwatershed;  and  to  establish  technical  strategies  specifically  designed  to  prevent  future  \nwater quality impairments in the watershed.  It should be understood and clearly stated \nthat current funding through the EPA Section 319 Water Quality Grant does not provide \nfor  implementation  of  technical  management  activities  outlined  in  this  section.    The  \nConservation Society and the WIT will need to identify and pursue alternative means of \nfunding implementation of these activities. \n \nTable 6.1 Technical Strategies \nTechnical Strategies Where When Budget \nWater Quality Sampling and Monitoring Entire Watershed On-going TBD \nConservation Easement and Buffer Zone Establishment Entire Watershed On-going TBD \n \nSpecific objectives of the technical committee include: \n \n \n6.2 W\nATER QUALITY SAMPLING AND MONITORING \n \n6.2.1 Desired Benefits \n \nWater quality sampling and monitoring will continue as appropriate to fill gaps in existing \ndata or to better identify areas of concern.  The information gathered by sampling and \nmonitoring  will  allow  environmental  concerns  to  be  identified  in  a  timely  fashion.    \nAddressing  these  concerns  early  and  pin-pointing  the  cause  can  prevent  wide-spread \ncontamination  of  the  river.    Water  quality  monitoring  will  also  provide  information  \nregarding the effectiveness of recently implemented BMPs. \n \n6.2.2 Activities \n \nSampling  and  monitoring  of  water  quality  will  be  conducted  as  appropriate  at  selected  \nsites throughout the watershed.  These activities may include physical assessment such \nas  inspection  and  ground  surveys,  surface  water  sampling  for  biological  and  chemical  \nanalysis,  and  biological  monitoring  for  macroinvertebrates  and/or  fish  and  may  involve  \ncontract staff, agency staff, and WIT participation.   \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n30 \n \n6.2.3 Participants \n \nMDEQ  Provide  assistance  with  sampling  and  monitoring  as  appropriate.  MDEQ  \nwill also provide assistance by offsetting some of the lab costs associated \nwith the analysis of collected samples. \n \nMDWFP  Provide assistance with sampling and monitoring if appropriate. \n \nUSGS  USGS  has  committed  through  an  agreement  with  MDEQ  to  provide  \nsampling and monitoring activities within the watershed. \n \nUSACE Provide assistance with sampling and monitoring if appropriate. \n \nUSDA  Provide assistance with sampling and monitoring if appropriate. \n \n6.2.4 Schedule \n \nSampling  conducted  in  association  with  this  plan  will  begin  in  the  spring  of  2010.    \nAdditional monitoring and/or sampling will be conducted as determined appropriate and \nspecific schedules will be developed for the monitoring proposed. \n \n6.2.5 Budget \n \nAn  estimated  budget  for  water  quality  monitoring  would  primarily  be  dependent  on  the  \nfrequency  and  extent  of  monitoring  and  sampling  activities.    However,  in  comparative  \nterms, the WRCS has received in-kind services for sampling and monitoring to-date with \nan estimated value of approximately $15,000 per year. \n \n \n6.3 \n CONSERVATION EASEMENT AND BUFFER ZONE ESTABLISHMENT \n \n6.3.1 Desired Benefits \n \nThe  WRCS  has  worked  diligently  to  procure  conservation  easements  along  the  Wolf  \nRiver.  These easements provide a protective buffer zone in which no development and \nonly selective timber harvesting/maintenance is allowed.   \n \n6.3.2 Activities \n \nThe WRCS will continue to establish conservation easements.  The WRCS will continue \nits  analysis  of  the  watershed  to  determine  specific  lands  to  target,  prioritization  of  \navailable lands, and negotiations with landowners and stakeholders. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n31 \n \n \n6.3.3 Participants \n \nWRCS The  WRCS  will  participate  in  all  aspects  of  acquisition  including  but  not  \nlimited to: identifying available properties, educating landowners on the tax \nbreaks   available   and   the   environmental   benefits   of   conservation   \neasements,  procuring  funds  for  procurement  of  conservation  easements,  \nand legal establishment of the conservation easement.    \n \nMDEQ  Will  participate  in  the  process  of  easement  acquisition  by  providing  \ninformation  on  prioritized  sites  relative  to  the  sites’  environmental  or  \nrecreation qualities. \n \nMDWFP  Will  provide  information  to  the  WRCS  regarding  locations  of  priority  \nconservation  sites.  MDWFP  will  also  provide  assistance  by  providing  \ninformation  related  to  participation  in  the  Mississippi  Scenic  Streams  \nprogram. \n \n \n6.3.4 Schedule \n \nThe WRCS will prioritize its acquisition goals based on the analysis of available lands. \n \n6.3.5 Budget \n \nThe budget for this task is dependent in part on negotiations with landowners seeking to \nplace  conservation  easements  on  targeted  properties.    In  addition,  the  procurement  of  \ngrant   monies   and   other   financial   support   for   the   establishment   of   conservation   \neasements will affect the estimated cost of this goal. \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n32 \n \n7.0 EDUCATION OUTREACH ACTIVITIES \n \n7.1 O\nBJECTIVES \n \nThe  public  education  component  of  the  WIP  is  designed  to  increase  awareness  of  \nwatershed issues such as the impacts of human activities on water quality impairment.  \nMultiple stakeholders and demographic groups will be targeted by the WIT’s Education \nCampaign.  \n \nSpecific objectives of the education committee include: \n• Increase  public  awareness  of  watershed  systems  and  the  cumulative  effects  of  \nhuman activities within the watershed; \n• Increase  the  awareness  of  culture,  heritage,  and  how  the  watershed  provides  a  \nsense of place to the region; \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water; \n• Increase   awareness   of   the   benefits   of   riparian   zones   and   conservation   \neasements; \n• Increase  public  awareness  of  the  hazards  of  ATV  use  within  stream/river  \nsystems; and \n• Target  younger  generations  with  a  positive  message  relaying  the  importance  of  \nenvironmental stewardship. \n \nSpecific activities designed to implement the strategies listed include: \n• Stakeholder Meetings and Presentations; \n• Coordinated   Media   Campaign   to   include   development   of   Public   Service   \nAnnouncements; \n• Development of Educational Materials; \n• Expedition Based Education; \n• Placement of Watershed Signage; and \n• West Harrison High School Partnership. \n \nTable 7.1 Summary of Education Strategies \nEducation Outreach Activity Where When Budget \nStakeholder Meetings and Presentations Entire Watershed 2009 – 2010 $10,000 \nWatershed Maps & GIS Database Entire Watershed 2009 – 2010  $10,000 \nCoordinated Media Campaign Entire Watershed 2009 – 2010 $10,000 \nDevelopment of Educational Materials Entire Watershed 2009 – 2010 $30,000 \nExpedition Based Education Entire Watershed 2009 – 2010 $20,000 \nWatershed Signage Entire Watershed 2009 – 2010 $10,000 \nWest Harrison High School Partnership Entire Watershed 2009 – 2010 $10,000 \nTotal Cost – Education Strategies \n$100,000 \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n33 \n \n7.2 STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND PRESENTATIONS \n \n7.2.1 Desired Benefits \n \nAn educational presentation will be developed to provide water quality information and \neducation to a variety of stakeholder groups.  This presentation will be created utilizing \ninformation  from  MDEQ,  MDWFP,  and  the  WRCS  to  highlight  concepts  of  non-point \nsource pollution, best management practices, the function of watersheds, conservation \neasement, buffer/riparian zones, and the impacts of human activities on water quality. \n \n7.2.2 Activities \n \nThe  WRCS  and  WIT  will  deliver  the  presentation  to  stakeholder  groups  such  as  civic  \nclubs,  professional  associations,  organized  meetings  and  other  venues  as  those  \nopportunities  present  themselves.    The  specific  groups  targeted  will  include  property  \nowners  within  the  watershed,  local  elected  officials,  builders  and  developers,  and  \nspecific  industries  such  as  the  timber  industry.    Regular  meetings  of  the WIT  will  be  \nincluded  as  a  reported  item  for  this  strategy.    It  is  anticipated  that  once  the  WIP  is  \napproved  by  MDEQ,  the  WIT  will  meet  on  a  quarterly  basis.    Additional  stakeholder  \npresentations will be conducted in 2010.   \n \n7.2.3 Participants \n \nWRCS Deliver  presentations  to  specific  stakeholder  groups  with  presentation  \nmaterials assembled by the consultant and the WIT. \n \nMDEQ Provide  data,  research,  images  and  other  components  to  be  included  in  \nthe presentations. \n \nMDWFP Provide  data,  research,  images  and  other  components  to  be  included  in  \nthe presentations. \n \nWIT The  WIT  will  assist  with  coordination  of  meetings  and  will  participate  in  \ndevelopment of presentation materials. \n \n7.2.4 Schedule \n \nThe WIT began meeting on April 16, 2009 to begin the process of developing the WIP.   \nDuring  the  plan  development  process,  the  WIT  met  four  times  from  April  16,  2009  – \nJanuary 2010.  The process of conducting other stakeholder meetings will begin in early \n2010  and  will  be  held  at  various  times  throughout  the  year.    It  is  anticipated  that  in  \naddition to WIT meetings, the WRCS will conduct four stakeholder meetings in 2010.   \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n34 \n \n7.2.5 Budget \n \nCosts associated with conducting stakeholder meetings will be primarily associated with \npreparation  of  presentation  materials,  travel  to  meeting  locations,  and  consultant  \npersonnel  time,  if  necessary.    It  is  anticipated  that  the  overall  cost  of  conducting  \nstakeholder meetings will be approximately $10,000.00. \n \n7.3 WATERSHED MAPS \n \n7.3.1 Desired Benefits \n \nA  comprehensive  database  of  mapping  data  will  be  developed  for  the  targeted  \nwatershed.    All  data  will  be  compiled  in  GIS  shapefile  format  and  will  include  the  \nconsolidation of existing data as well as development of additional data as opportunities \npresent themselves and as appropriate.  The purpose of the mapping efforts will be to \nprovide  a  thorough  documentation  of  existing  conditions  in  the  watershed,  to  provide  \neffective  illustrations  of  watershed  features,  and  to  provide  a  spatial  context  for  the  \nwatershed.    Collection  of  map  data  and  creation  of  watershed  maps  will  begin  \nimmediately and will be on-going as additional mapping data is obtained or generated.  \nThe effectiveness of this measure will be determined primarily by the direct usefulness \nfor development and implementation of related actions of the WIP. \n \n7.3.2 Activities \n \nThe WRCS and the WIT have initiated preparation of maps of the watershed based on \ncurrently  available  sources  of  geospatial  data.    Map  development  at  this  stage  of  \nplanning is primarily developed in support of the WIP and to provide a spatial context for \nplanning efforts.  Several thematic maps have been developed as exhibits to this plan.  \nData  currently  being  used  have  been  derived  from  a  variety  of  sources  including  the  \nU.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), \nthe  Mississippi  Automated  Resource  Information  Service  (MARIS),  and  the  Mississippi  \nGeospatial Clearinghouse. \n \nDevelopment of the GIS database for the watershed is planned to assist in the planning \nprocess.  Existing data regarding water quality, conservation areas, wildlife and fishery \nresources, land use, and environmental resource rankings will be compiled and used to \nhelp  establish  historic  and  baseline  conditions,  identify  existing  issues  and  concerns,  \ndevelop  educational  materials,  and  to  plan  for  the  implementation  of  educational  \nstrategies as communicated. \n \n7.3.3 Participants \n \nThe following activities are proposed according to the listed participants: \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n35 \n \n \nWRCS WRCS  will  compile  mapping  data  and  will  assist  in  the  creation  of  a  GIS  \ndatabase  specifically  for  planning  purposes  and  to  support  concepts  \nillustrated through the WIP.

The  budget  \nfor watershed mapping is anticipated to be at $10,000. \n \n \n7.4 COORDINATED MEDIA CAMPAIGN \n \n7.4.1 Desired Benefits \n \nLocal  media  outlets  will  be  encouraged  to  present  information  on  watershed-related \nactivities such as opportunities for public involvement and general news stories relating \nto  conservation  efforts  taking  place  in  the  watershed.    The  media  campaign  will  \nspecifically target those media outlets with exposure in and around the watershed.  The \nprimary  goal  of  the  coordinated  media  campaign  will  be  to  increase  the  level  of  \nawareness of the watershed and water quality issues associated with the watershed. \n \nThrough the coordinated media campaign, the WRCS and the WIT will develop a series \nof public service announcements focusing on recreation opportunities in the watershed \nand general water quality issues in the watershed.   \n \n7.4.2 Activities \n \nThrough the coordinated media campaign, the WRCS and the WIT will develop a series \nof public service announcements focusing on recreation opportunities and general water \nquality issues in the watershed.   \n \nThe  media  campaign  will  focus  its  efforts  on  providing  information  through  fishing  and  \nhunting  television  programs,  newspaper  and  magazine  articles.    In  addition,  a  public  \nservice  announcement  will  be  prepared  and  provided  to  local  radio  and  television  \nstations. \n \n7.4.3 Participants \n \nWRCS The  Wolf  River  Conservation  Society  and  the  WIT  will  work  together  to  \nestablish  priority  messages  for  public  service  announcements  and  other  \ninformation to be distributed to media outlets. \n \nWIT The WIT will assist the WRCS in identifying appropriate media outlets and \nopportunities for media coverage of implementation activities. \n \n7.4.4 Schedule \n \nThe WRCS has previously coordinated educational opportunities via print media outlets \nand  will  continue  to  lead  the  media  campaign  with  the  assistance  of  other  entities  and  \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n37 \n \nthe WIT.  The coordinated media campaign will begin in early 2010 and is expected to \nbe completed by December 2010. \n \n7.4.5 Budget \n \nIt is anticipated that the overall cost of conducting the coordinated media campaign will \nbe approximately $10,000.00 \n \n \n7.5 DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS \n \n7.5.1 Desired Benefits \n \nThe WRCS and the WIT will utilize a variety of strategies to provide general educational \ninformation to stakeholders and other interested parties.  Through this effort, the WRCS \ndesires  to  reach  a  broad  audience  with  a  series  of  messages  related  to  water  quality,  \nrecreational  opportunities,  benefits  of  conservation  easements,  and  other  issues  of  \nconcern related to the Wolf River Watershed. \n \n7.5.2 Activities \n \nThrough the development of educational materials, the WRCS will employ four specific \nstrategies to include: \n• Development of factsheets and brochures specific to the Wolf River Watershed; \n• Execution  of  a  mass  mail-out  of  brochures  and  other  information.    The  mass  \nmail-out will specifically target property owners within the watershed; \n• The  WRCS  will  develop  a  table-top  display  of  materials  to  include  educational  \ninformation,  pictures,  and  maps  of  the  watershed.    The  table-top  display  will  \ninitially  be  set  up  at  public  venues  within  the  watershed  including  schools  and  \nother  public  buildings.    The  table-top  display  will  also  be  used  by  the  WRCS  at  \nconferences and trade shows throughout the region; and \n• The  WRCS  will  also  develop  a  website  that  will  include  information  about  the  \nWRCS  but  will  also  include  information  pertinent  to  the  WIP  including  the  final  \nplan document, images from the watershed, maps of the watershed, a schedule \nof  events,  links  to  agency  and  other  supporting  websites,  and  e-mail  links  to  \nallow viewers to contact WRCS representatives.  In addition, the WRCS will set \nup  a  page  on  a  social  networking  website  to  facilitate  broader  coverage  of  the  \nWRCS’s mission and message. \n \n7.5.3 Participants \n \nWIT Will  discuss  and  provide  input  on  specific  information  to  be  included  in  \neducational materials to be prepared. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n38 \n \n \nWRCS Will  identify  specific  issues  to  be  communicated  in  prepared  educational  \nmaterials  and  will  work  with  the  consultant  and  a  website  development  \ncompany to develop a WRCS website. \n \n7.5.4 Schedule \n \nBrochures and the table-top display will be developed during the first quarter of 2010.  It \nis  anticipated  that  the  mass  mail-out  will  be  conducted  in  the  second  quarter  of  2010.    \nWebsite  development  will  begin  in  the  first  quarter  of  2010  with  the  goal  of  having  the  \nwebsite “live” by mid-year 2010. \n \n7.5.5 Budget \n \nActivities to be implemented through this strategy will require the largest component of \nthe project budget and will include: \n \n• Development of factsheets and brochures  $10,000.00 \n• Mass mail-out        $5,000.00 \n• Table-top display development      $5,000.00 \n• Website development     $10,000.00 \nTotal Cost Estimate $30,000.00 \n \n \n7.6 E\nXPEDITION BASED EDUCATION \n \n7.6.1 Desired Benefits \n \nThe desired benefit of this strategy is to create a sense of ownership of the Wolf River in \nall  stakeholders.    The  concept  of  “out  of  sight,  out  of  mind”  is  often  associated  with  \nenvironmental issues such as watershed heath.  Once on the river, it is very difficult to \ndeny its beauty, inherent worth and the necessity for conservation. \n \n7.6.2 Activities \n \nTwo  primary  activities  are  proposed  for  this  strategy  and  are  primarily  designed  to  \nincrease  awareness  of  the  watershed  and  to  provide  opportunities  for  participants  to  \ngain “first-hand” experiences in the watershed.  The proposed activities include: \n \n• Participation  in  existing  community  events  to  include  providing  educational  and  \npromotional  materials  related  to  the  Wolf  River  Watershed.    The  Conservation  \nSociety will work to participate in at least three events in 2010 with the intent of \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n39 \n \nparticipating  in  a  variety  of  events  to  include  all  areas  of  the  watershed.  \nExamples of existing events the Conservation Society may participate in include: \no The Coastal Development Strategies Conference – May 12-13, 2010 \no Blueberry Jubilee: Poplarville, MS – Dates to be announced \no Mississippi Coastal Cleanup 2010 – October 16, 2010 \no Celebrate  the  Gulf  2010  –  Environmental  Education  Festival  –  April  10,  \n2010 \no Lumberfest: Lumberton, MS – Dates to be announced \n• The WRCS will organize and execute a series of stream clean-up events through \nwhich   local   stakeholders   may   participate   in   cleaning   up   targeted   stream   \nsegments along the Wolf River.  It is anticipated that two events will be organized \nand executed in 2010. \n \n7.6.3 Participants \n \nWRCS Will identify specific events and will coordinate and facilitate participation. \n \nWIT  Organization and advertisement of expedition events. \n \nMWFP Will   provide   educational   information   and   participation   in   both   the   \nwatershed   fair   and   clean-up   events   to   include   an   Adopt-A-Stream \nworkshop to be held in conjunction with the watershed fair. \n \nMDEQ Will provide logistical support for both proposed events. \n \nVolunteers Will  participate  in  both  events  and  will  assist  with  logistical  and  planning  \nsupport \n \n7.6.4 Schedule \n \nThe WRCS will conduct two stream clean-up events during 2010 to include one in the \nspring  and  one  in  the  fall.    It  is  anticipated  that  participation  in  fairs  and  events  \nthroughout the watershed will be based on actual scheduling of events. \n \n7.6.5 Budget \n \nThe budget for this strategy is approximately $20,000 and includes support for clean-up \nand watershed fair activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n40 \n \n \n7.7 W\nATERSHED SIGNAGE \n \n7.7.1 Desired Benefits \n \nThe  placement  of  signage  throughout  the  watershed  will  have  the  benefit  of  creating  \nwatershed awareness and will also serve to educate the motoring public on the various \nelements of the watershed including the location of specific streams and water bodies.  \nThe placement of signage will also be used to identify public access locations with the \ndesired benefit of increasing the level of recreational activity within the watershed.  \n \n7.7.2 Activities \n \nA  variety  of  options  exist  for  the  content  and  placement  of  signs  within  the  watershed.    \nOne option involves the placement of signs on major highways at the entrances to the \nwatershed.    Previous  experience  has  indicated  that  MDOT  will  not  allow  watershed  \nsigns  to  be  placed  on  State  or  Federal  highways  at  watershed  boundaries.    As  an  \nalternative, the WRCS will evaluate county transportation routes that intersect the Wolf \nRiver  and  will  work  with  county  Boards  of  Supervisors  to  procure  and  install  signs  at  \nthese intersections.   \n \nPlacement  of  signs  at  public  access  points  will  require  identification  of  existing  public  \naccess locations and development of appropriate signage at these identified locations. \n \n7.7.3 Participants \n \nWRCS In  cooperation  with  the  counties  within  the  watershed,  the  WRCS  will  \ndetermine strategic locations for placement of the signs. \n \nCounties Will provide guidance as to the placement of signs and will provide direct \nassistance in the assembly and installation of signs. \n \nMDEQ MDEQ   will   provide   assistance   by   helping   to   identify   optimum   sign   \nplacement  within  the  watershed  and  by  coordinating  installation  activities  \nwith MDOT. \n \nWIT Will  coordinate  with  watershed  counties  to  identify  sign  locations  and  will  \ncoordinate design and acquisition of signs. \n \n7.7.4 Schedule \n \nSign locations will be identified during the first quarter of 2010.  Signs will be purchased \nand installed during the second and third quarters of 2010. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n41 \n \n \n7.7.5 Budget \n \nThe budget for the watershed signage component will be $10,000.00. \n \n7.  8  WEST HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP \n \n7.8.1 Desired Benefits \n \nThe  desired  benefit  to  a  partnership  with  the  West  Harrison  High  School  (WHHS)  is  \nincreased awareness of watershed concerns of students and faculty.  This partnership \nis designed to provide supplemental curriculum focused on conservation, environmental \nconcerns, heritage and cultural history related to the Wolf River watershed.   \n \n7.8.2 Activities \n \nVolunteers  from  the  Wolf  River  Conservation  Society  will  facilitate  establishment  and  \nsponsorship of a Key Club at West Harrison High School.  The Key Club will engage in \neducational   and   service   opportunities   related   to   environmental   management   and   \nstewardship of the Wolf River Watershed. \n \n7.8.3 Participants \n \nWHHS Students will participate in Key Club meetings and associated educational \nand service activities. \n \nWRCS  The Wolf River Conservation Society will facilitate organization and \nsponsorship of a Key Club at West Harrison High School including \nidentification of teachers to serve as staff representatives for the club. \n \nWIT The WIT will coordinate with WHHS and the WRCS to facilitate \nimplementation of activities. \n \n7.8.4 Schedule \n \nOrganization  of  the  Key  Club  will  take  place  by  the  end  of  the  2009-2010  school  year  \nwith planned activities in the spring and in the fall of the 2010-2011 school year. \n \n7.8.5 Budget \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n42 \n \nActivities related to the Key Club will be volunteer based with the WRCS and the School \nproviding  support.    It  is  anticipated  that  costs  associated  with  this  activity  will  be  \nminimal. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n43 \n \n8.0 PLAN EVALUATION \n \nThis  watershed  implementation  plan  will  be  evaluated  and  revised  during  the  first  \nquarter of 2011.  The purpose of this evaluation is to ensure that the provisions of the \nplan  are  having  the  intended  effect  and  to  ensure  that  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  \nplan are being met.  In the event that the intended results are not being achieved, the \nplan will be revised as appropriate.  In addition, the plan evaluation and revision process \nis  designed  to  provide  for  a  mechanism  for  the  WRCS  to  continue  to  follow  plan  \nelements beyond the period of grant funding from MDEQ.   \n \nThe  review  process  will  involve  a  meeting  of  the  WIT  to  discuss  and  review  progress  \nmade  during  the  previous  year  as  determined  by  on-going  monitoring  conducted \nthroughout the year.  During that meeting, the team will determine if recommendations \nneed to be made concerning the revision of the plan.  Once those determinations have \nbeen made, participating stakeholders will be notified of the intended revisions and will \nbe  given  an  opportunity  to  review  and  comment  on  the  proposed  revisions.    The  \nfollowing  schedule  is  representative  of  the  review  and  revision  schedule  that  will  be  \nfollowed by the WIT: \n \nReview Activity \nJanuary  February March \nWk \n1 \nWk \n2 \nWk \n3 \nWk \n4 \nWk \n1 \nWk \n2 \nWk \n3 \nWk \n4 \nWk \n1 \nWk \n2 \nWk \n3 \nWk \n4 \nWIT Review Meeting                         \nSubmission of Proposed Changes to Stakeholders                         \nStakeholder Review and Comment Period                         \nIncorporation of Comments into Plan Revisions                         \nFinalize Revisions and Submit to DEQ for Review                         \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \n44 \n \n9.0 PLAN REVISION \n \nAfter  the  plan  has  been  appropriately  evaluated,  and  if  revisions  have  been  deemed  \nnecessary,   the   WRCS,   the   WIT   and   MDEQ   will   prepare   a   revised   watershed   \nimplementation  plan  that  will  include  changes  requested  by  the  stakeholders.    If  \nnecessary,  a  follow-up  meeting  may  be  called  to  reconcile  conflicting  comments  or  \nmodification requests. \n \nIn  the  event  that  implementation  of  the plan  is  achieving  the  desired  results,  the  plan  \nmay  still  be  modified  to  address  different,  new  or  emerging  issues  that  may  have  the  \npotential to impact water quality and the objectives of the plan.  If the evaluated results \nare satisfactory and changes specific to the scope of the plan are warranted, the same \nprocedure  for  plan  review  and  revision  will  be  followed  to  ensure  that  all  appropriate  \nelements  of  the  plan  are  addressing  water  quality  issues  affecting  the  watershed.    In  \neither case, the procedures to be followed for plan review and revision will include those \nelements listed in the above table. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nI \n \n10.0  APPENDICES \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nII \n \n \nAPPENDIX A: COMMONLY USED ACRONYMS \n \nATV     All Terrain Vehicle  \nBMPs  Best Management Practices \nCFR    Code of Federal Regulations \nFEMA  Federal Emergency Management Agency \nGEMS  Gulf Ecological Management Site \nGIS  Geographic Information Systems \nHUC    Hydrological Unit Code \nMARIS Mississippi Automated Resource Information System \nMDEQ Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMDMR Mississippi Department of Marine Resources \nMDOT  Mississippi Department of Transportation \nMWF   Mississippi Wildlife Federation \nMWFP Mississippi Department of Wildlife and Fisheries \nNRCS  Natural Resources Conservation Service \nSMZs   Streamside Management Zones \nTMDL  Total Maximum Daily Load \nUSFS  United States Forest Service \nUSGS  United States Geological Survey \nWHHS West Harrison High School \nWIP     Watershed Implementation Plan \nWIT  Watershed Implementation Team \nWRCS  Wolf River Conservation Society \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nIII \n \n \nAPPENDIX B: MISCELLANEOUS WATERSHED MAPS \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nIV \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nV \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nVI \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nVII \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nVIII \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nIX \n \n \nAPPENDIX C: MDEQ ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE RANKING MAPS \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nX \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXI \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXII \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXIII \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXIV \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXV \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXVI \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXVII \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXVIII \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXIX \n \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nWolf River \n2009 \nXX \n \n ",
