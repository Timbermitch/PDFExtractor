Materials  from  selected dump  sites  should  be  removed  and  properly  disposed  of,  and  the  dump  site secured  as  appropriate  to  discourage  future  dumping.    State  and  local  law enforcement  officials  will  be  employed  to  investigate  and  prosecute  violators  if known.    Inputs  of  floatable  litter  from  urbanized  areas  of  Meridian  have  been suggested  as  a  major  source  of  objectionable  materials  present  in  Sowashee and  Okatibbee  Creeks.    Measures  to  reduce  inputs  and  structural  control measures  to  screen  floatable  materials  may  also  be  considered  to  address  the concern.",
