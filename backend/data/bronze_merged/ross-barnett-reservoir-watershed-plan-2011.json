The \nReservoir serves as the primary water supply for the City of Jackson, \nwhich is located southwest of the Reservoir. As it has done for more than \n50 years, this plentiful water resource supports economic growth in central \nMississippi and provides outstanding recreational opportunities, scenic \nbeauty, and vital wildlife habitats.  Recognizing this, the Mississippi \nDepartment of Environmental Quality and the Pearl River Valley Water \nSupply District jointly developed the Ross Barnett Reservoir Initiative, \nknown as Rezonate!.\nThe Reservoir’s watershed includes more than 3,000 square miles of \nland and over 4,000 miles of flowing rivers and streams. All uses of \nland within the Reservoir’s watershed can potentially impact water \nquality in its tributaries and ultimately in \nthe Reservoir itself. This Comprehensive \nProtection and Restoration Plan for the Ross \nBarnett Reservoir Watershed will serve as the \nframework for long-term, coordinated multi \nagency efforts to protect and restore water \nquality in the Reservoir and its watershed.\nThe Reservoir provides many social \nand economic benefits.   \nPhoto by Brian Albert Broom.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nii\nThis Plan recognizes six high priority issues in the Reservoir and its \nwatershed, and recommends management measures for reducing and \ncontrolling them. The majority of the pollutants originate from diffuse \nsources throughout the Reservoir watershed, including urban stormwater, \nstream bank erosion, and runoff from rural and agricultural areas. Since these \ndiffuse pollutant sources cannot be attributed to a single location or regulated \nentity, they are termed “nonpoint source pollutants.” Specific issues are:\n• Sediments and turbid water,\n• Nutrient enrichment and algae growth,\n• Bacteria and other pathogens,\n• Invasive aquatic plant species, \n• Pesticides (currently used herbicides  \n   and insecticides), and\n• Trash dumping and littering in and around  \n   the Reservoir and its shoreline.\nThe Reservoir provides drinking water \nto citizens of the City of Jackson.   \nPhoto by Shutterstock.\nRecreational benefits of \nthe Reservoir.   \nPhoto by Brian Albert Broom.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\niii\nThis Plan is intended to address the entire Reservoir watershed and \nrecommends general management concepts applicable throughout the \ndrainage basin along with specific pollution reduction measures for \ntargeted areas. The use of green infrastructure management practices, \na cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly approach \nto stormwater management, is the key pollution management concept \nrecommended in this Plan.\nGreen infrastructure management practices include streamside  \nbuffer zones, bioretention basins, vegetated drainage swales, \nconstructed wetlands, and preserved trees/vegetation. \nPreserving and restoring natural landscape features (such as \nforests, stream buffers, and wetlands) are critical components \nof green infrastructure. Communities in the Reservoir \nwatershed can use green infrastructure to improve water quality \nand solve stormwater management issues, while providing \nwildlife habitat and opportunities for outdoor recreation.\nNine overarching management strategies have been developed for the \nReservoir watershed. The strategies incorporate green infrastructure \nmanagement principles to achieve the goals and realize the Rezonate \nvision statement.\nImproved water quality, \nbetter human health, \nand increased property \nvalues are among the \nmany benefits of green \ninfrastructure.\nGreen infrastructure \nmanagement practices \nmaintain or mimic \nnatural processes \nby capturing and \ncleaning stormwater \nclose to its source.\nThe Reservoir supports important \nfish habitats.   \nPhoto by Brian Albert Broom.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\niv\nSTRaTegy 1: Maintain, and restore where \npossible, the existing riparian buffer zones \nalong the Reservoir shoreline and the banks of \ntributaries.\n Vegetated buffer zones are an effective and low-cost \nelement of green infrastructure that can be used in the Reservoir watershed. \nMaintaining a vegetated buffer along shorelines and streams provides an \nattractive landscape and can improve water quality by removing sediment \nand chemicals before they reach surface waters. In addition, buffers provide \nflood control, help recharge groundwater, prevent soil erosion, and improve \nwildlife habitat. When feasible, buffer zones should be restored to a width \nof at least 50 ft in already-developed areas. Avoid disturbance of buffer \nzones in undeveloped areas.\nSTRaTegy 2: Do not remove \nvegetation or disturb soils, if \npossible. If disturbed, minimize \nthe exposure time of bare soils.\n \nThe Reservoir watershed contains some of the most \nhighly erosive soils in the United States, especially \nin portions of Rankin, Madison, and Leake counties. \nWhen bare soils are exposed (due to construction and \nsurface mining) to intense rain they will quickly erode, \nwhich eventually leads to large gullies. This eroded soil \nwashes into surface waters, which in turn chokes streams \nand fills the Reservoir. Retain existing trees and other \nvegetation where feasible, and quickly replant disturbed  \nsites with native vegetation.\nProperly managed \ndevelopment using a \ngreen infrastructure \napproach can support \nsustainable economic \ngrowth and maintain \nthe water quality in \nthe Reservoir.\nReservoir shoreline.   \nPhoto by Laura Sheely.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nv\nSTRaTegy 3: Control urban runoff within \nsites where it is generated, and reduce the \nquantity of stormwater and pollutants through \ncapture, infiltration, and evapotranspiration.\n \nExcess stormwater from developed areas can damage stream channels \nand carry tons of sediment and other pollutants to surface waters. \nManagement measures that remove pollutants close to the source, such as \nbioretention basins, constructed wetlands, and rain barrels, are much more \nenvironmentally effective and cost-effective than attempting to treat the \nwater downstream. \nSTRaTegy 4: Use natural, bioengineering \ntechniques to repair failing stream banks and \neroding gullies.\n Preliminary estimates indicate that as much as \n65% of the sediments transported to the Reservoir in some areas originate \nfrom instream sources (i.e., eroding banks, resuspension from stream beds, \nand sediments stored in channels from past activities). Bioengineering \nerosion control techniques combine structural components and native plant \nmaterial to protect the banks, improve aquatic habitat, and improve the \nappearance of eroding streams.\nSTRaTegy 5: Adopt new ordinances or \nexpand existing ordinances regulating land \ndevelopment, stormwater management, and \nlandscaping if voluntary measures are shown \nto be insufficient.\n Review local stormwater management \nand erosion control policies for stream buffer protection, undisturbed \ngreen space, erosion and sediment controls on individual lots within \nBank failures contribute to \nsediments and turbid water  \nin Reservoir tributaries.   \nPhotos by Laura Sheely.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nvi\ndevelopments, and post construction stormwater management. If water \nquality problems persist, zoning policies, and local ordinances will need to \nbe strengthened in order to sustain the long-term health and beneficial uses \nof the Reservoir and its tributary streams.\nSTRaTegy 6: Continue public outreach and \neducation by implementing the activities \nrecommended for each targeted audience in the \nComprehensive Education and Outreach Plan.\n \nNonpoint source pollution control is a community-based activity. Effective \nmanagement of nonpoint source pollution requires a long-term commitment \nto educating the general public, educators and students, civic groups, \nhomeowners, decision-makers, and developers/contractors. Keep the public \ninformed about Rezonate events, restoration projects, and success stories. \nCultivate local champions (individuals, civic groups, or businesses) to take \npersonal ownership and have a leading role in promoting conservation in the \nReservoir watershed.\nSTRaTegy 7: Work with federal, state, \nand local agencies to support conservation \nactivities that are in progress on forested and \nagricultural lands and animal production. \nMany \nrural landowners in the Reservoir watershed are already participating in \nprograms of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and \nMississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission (MSWCC) to install \nand maintain best management practices (BMPs) in pastures and row-crop \nfields and for poultry-growing operations. Look for new opportunities to \nenhance green infrastructure through practices such as field borders and filter \nMr. Whiskers was created  \nas the Rez\nonate mascot. \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nvii\nstrips, while taking advantage of cost-sharing programs to fund their installation \nand maintenance. Work with NRCS to prioritize funding for practices in targeted \nsubwatersheds. Also, participate in forestry stewardship programs and use the \ntechnical expertise available from the Mississippi Forestry Commission (MFC) \nto properly manage logging operations on forest land.\nSTRaTegy 8: Develop and implement an \nincentive program to encourage the voluntary \nuse of green infrastructure management \nmeasures.\n The successful implementation of this Plan relies heavily on \nthe willingness of landowners to implement measures on their properties and \nthe ability of designers to include them in retrofits and new developments. \nIncentive programs are creative tools that nonprofit organizations or \ngovernments can use to encourage the use of green infrastructure on these \nprivate properties. Incentives allow governments to act beyond the confines of \ntheir regulatory authority to improve stormwater management and encourage \nthe use of measures not required by local zoning and ordinances. Examples of \nincentive programs include property tax credits, expedited permit approval, \ngrants, awards, and recognition. Incentive programs must be developed and \nimplemented by local or state governments or non governmental organizations \nbased on available resources. \nSTRaTegy 9: Focus Phase I restoration and \nprotection efforts on targeted subwatersheds \ndefined by 12-digit hydrologic unit codes \n(HUC12s).\n Develop detailed watershed implementation plans (WIPs) for \nhigh priority areas. Use early successes realized in these watersheds to shape \nfuture management measures through an adaptive management process. \nA constructed wetland is used to treat \nstormwater from the parking lot of the \nMississippi Museum of Natural Science.   \nPhoto by Laura Sheely.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nviii\nThis Plan recommends specific management measures for targeted \nsubwatersheds. Restoration measures are recommended for \nsubwatersheds that contain the most significant pollutant sources (i.e., hot \nspots) or have known water quality issues. Protection measures are \nrecommended for subwatersheds that have little development and few \npollutant sources. Protection measures help preserve the pristine condition of \nthese areas. \nImplementation of management measures on a watershed-wide scale (i.e., the \nentire Ross Barnett Watershed) is not practical or economically feasible. Thus, \nthis Plan recommends focusing the first phase of implementation efforts on \nthree subwatersheds targeted for restoration (Mill-Pelahatchie Creek, Riley-\nPelahatchie Creek, and Ashlog-Pelahatchie Creek) and one subwatershed \ntargeted for protection (Lake Creek-Pearl River) (see Figure ES.1).\nIn future years, \nimplementation efforts \nwill be extended to \nother subwatersheds \nas additional funding, \nstakeholder interest, \nand technical \nresources become \navailable.\nPearl River upstream of the Reservoir \nis largely underdeveloped. \nPhoto by Brian Albert Broom.\n\nFiguRe eS.1. Targeted subwatersheds.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nx\nRestoration: Mill-Pelahatchie Creek\nThe Mill-Pelahatchie Creek subwatershed is located entirely in \nRankin County. It is adjacent to Pelahatchie Bay, an important \nlocation for drinking water protection efforts. This watershed \ncontains a high percentage of developed area (Figure ES.2). Thus, \nurban green infrastructure practices would be effective and highly \nvisible in this area. Restoration measures will reduce pollutants \ncontributed from construction sites and developed areas.\nRecommended restoration measures are as follows:\n• Incorporate green infrastructure stormwater  \n   management practices in new construction  \n\t and\tretrofits,\n•\tCoordinate\twith\tRankin\tCounty\tofficials\tin \tmatters\t \n   related to stormwater management in developed areas,\n• Improve construction stormwater controls on individual lots  \n   that are within a larger common plan of development,\n• Stabilize disturbed soils on construction sites and  \n   surface mines by quickly replanting with native grasses  \n   and other vegetation,\n• Identify and restore shoreline and streamside buffer zones  \n   and banks in needed areas, and repair eroding gullies,\n• Leave undisturbed vegetated areas (i.e., green space) and  \n   shoreline/streamside buffer zones within new developments, and\n• Develop an incentive program to encourage the use  \n   of green infrastructure management practices.\nFiguRe eS.2.  \nLanduse in the Mill Creek-Pelahatchie \nCreek Watershed.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nxi\nRestoration: Riley-Pelahatchie Creek\nThe Riley-Pelahatchie Creek subwatershed is also located \nin Rankin County and contains some development from the \noutskirts of Flowood and Fannin. As growth continues, these \nareas should be managed in the same manner as Mill-Pelahatchie \nCreek (i.e., construction stormwater control and green \ninfrastructure management measures). This HUC12 also contains \nextensive pasture and timber areas that should be carefully \nmanaged to control nonpoint source pollutants (Figure ES.3). \nRecommended restoration measures are as follows:\n• address compliance issues at a wastewater treatment  \n   facility discharging into Pelahatchie Creek (Reservoir  \n   east) and encourage all new homes and buildings to connect  \n   to a central sewer system because most soils are not suitable  \n   for septic tanks,\n• Incorporate green infrastructure stormwater management  \n   measures for new construction,\n• Preserve streamside buffers and green space as new development  \n   expands to this area,\n• Stabilize disturbed soils on construction and surface mining sites  \n   by quickly replanting with native grasses and other vegetation, \n• Impl\n\nement pasture management practices on all areas with willing  \n   landowners, and\n• encourage participation in forestry stewardship programs.\nFiguRe eS.3.  \nLanduse in the Riley Creek-Pelahatchie \nCreek Watershed.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nxii\nRestoration: Ashlog-Pelahatchie Creek\nThe Ashlog-Pelahatchie Creek subwatershed is located in the \nheadwaters of Pelahatchie Creek within Rankin and Scott \ncounties. Headwater systems are generally more responsive to \nBMPs (i.e., nonpoint source reductions can be detected more \nquickly in smaller streams). There is some urban development in \nthe City of Pelahatchie. However, the watershed contains mostly \nforested and pasture land with limited row crop agriculture \n(Figure ES.4). There are several poultry growing operations \nlocated within this HUC12.\nRecommended restoration measures are as follows:\n• Incorporate green infrastructure stormwater  \n   management measures in new construction and  \n\t retrofit\tprojects\tin\tthe\tCity\tof\tPelahatchie,\n• Preserve streamside buffers and green space as development  \n   continues in this area,\n• assist poultry growers to ensure that they have access to technical  \n   expertise and cost-sharing programs to implement nutrient  \n   management plans,\n• Implement pasture management measures and best management  \n   practices for agricultural crops in all areas with willing landowners, \n•\tInvestigate\tflooding\tconcerns\tthrough\tevaluation\tof\tPelahatchie\t \n\t Creek’s\tflow\tcapacity,\tand\n• encourage participation in forestry stewardship programs.\nFiguRe eS.4.  \nLanduse in the Ashlog Creek-\nPelahatchie Creek Watershed.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nxiii\nProtection: Lake Creek-Pearl River\nThe Lake Creek-Pearl River subwatershed is located upstream \nof the Reservoir in a section of the Pearl River that is used \nextensively for recreation (between Ratliff Ferry and the Low-\nHead Dam). There are few roads, making most access by boat. \nAlso, there is little development and almost no croplands in \nthis watershed (Figure ES.5). It is important to protect the \nwetland areas as they serve important functions for water quality \npreservation and flood protection for areas downstream. \nRecommendations for protection measures are as follows:\n• Maintain wetlands, streamside buffer zones,  \n   and undisturbed green space,\n• Partner with Keep the Reservoir Beautiful to curb littering  \n   by recreational boaters, \n• Use education programs to promote a sense of pride and  \n   responsibility for environmental preservation of this area, and\n• Promote conservation easements through partnerships between  \n\t non-profit\tgroups\tand\tprivate\tlandowners.\nFiguRe eS.5.  \nLanduse in the Lake Creek- \nPearl River Watershed.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOctober 31, 2011\nxiv\nProtecting and \nmaintaining clean \nwater in the Reservoir \nand its watershed is \na community-based \nactivity that will \nrequire the long-\nterm cooperation \nand commitment of \nmany individuals. \nThis Comprehensive \nWatershed Protection \nand Restoration Plan \nis intended to sustain \nthese waters as a \nuseful and healthy \nresource for many \nyears to come.\nThis Comprehensive Watershed Protection and Restoration Plan was developed \nwith input from local citizens, resource agency representatives, and technical \nexperts in watershed planning and nonpoint source pollution management. This \nPlan, the product of almost 2 years of research and collaboration, ties together \nthe following set of comprehensive planning documents.\n• Water Quality Monitoring Plan for the  \n   Reservoir and Watershed,\n• Pathogen Source assessment and  \n   Wastewater Management Plan, \n• Comprehensive education and Outreach Plan  \n   for Rezonate!, and \n• Source Water Protection Plan for the  \n   O.B.

\nRecognizing the importance of the Ross Barnett Reservoir, the Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District (PRVWSD), \nalong with the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Mississippi Soil and \nWater Conservation Commission (MSWCC), initiated planning to protect and restore water \nquality in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. This effort, initially called the Ross Barnett \nReservoir Initiative, has been branded as Rezonate! A set of comprehensive plans based on the \nvision statement and common goals will guide implementation of the Rezonate Plans. \n \n1.1      Vision      \nA vision statement for the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed (Figure 1.1) serves as the \nstarting point for developing all aspects of Rezonate. The vision for the Ross Barnett Reservoir \nInitiative was developed by a group of agency representatives and local stakeholders responsible \nfor various resource management activities in the Reservoir and its watershed. Representatives \nresponsible for economic development in the five counties located closest to the Reservoir \n(Madison, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, and Leake counties) were also invited to participate in an \ninteractive discussion about ways to improve water quality while enhancing the environmental, \neducational, and recreational value of the Reservoir. Attendees included representatives of \nPRVWSD, MDEQ, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), local economic \ndevelopment groups, state and county government, the Rankin County School District, and local \nreal estate developers. The vision statement is an expression of the group’s desires and intentions \nfor the status of the Reservoir in the future. The vision statement is given on Figure 1.1. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n1-2 \nBorn  of  the  aspirations,  dreams  and  desires  of  visionaries  past,  the \nRoss  Barnett  Reservoir  is  an  interwoven  community  of  residential,  \ncommercial,  wildlife  and  ecological  systems  that  coexist  to  create  a  \nsource of life, as well as a source of lifestyle. \n \nIt  is  a  dichotomy  of  rural  wilderness  and  the  most  upscale  modern  \ndevelopments.  A  community  in  the  traditional  sense,  the  Reservoir  is  \nalso  a  community  in  the  larger  sense  ...  one  where  all  of  Mississippi  \nmay take part in camping, boating, hiking, bicycling and a destination \nfor experiential learning, as well as a source for economic development \nand social interaction. \n \nThe   common   thread   to   all   this   activity   and   community   is   the   \nunsurpassed water quality management practices performed within the \nReservoir’s  watershed.  It  is  an  area  vehemently  protected  by  a  highly  \nmotivated,    enlightened    citizenry    that    has    a    passion    for    the    \nsustainability of this precious resource. \n \nA source of pride and a wellspring of enjoyment, the Reservoir is a place \nwhere all who appreciate its many benefits take personal responsibility \nfor sustaining its unique characteristics for generations to come. \nFigure 1.1. Vision statement. \n \n \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n1-3 \n1.2      Goals      \nBased on the vision statement, there are four goals for the Ross Barnett Reservoir \nInitiative. The goals are as follows: \n \n• Develop a group of champions that will lead water quality improvements now and \nwill continue the vision into the future. \n• Promote a sense of community, citizen pride and involvement, and personal \nresponsibility among residents of central Mississippi. \n• Protect and restore water quality and the designated/desired uses in the Reservoir \nand its tributaries. \n• Maintain a healthy balance and diversity in using land and its resources in the \nReservoir watershed. \n \n1.3      Rezonate Plans \nA number of planning documents were developed to guide all future protection and \nrestoration activities in the Reservoir watershed. A list of plans is included below. The content of \neach plan is described in Appendix A. \n \n• Comprehensive Watershed Protection and Restoration Plan, \n• Water Quality Monitoring Plan for the Reservoir and Watershed, \n• Pathogen Source Assessment and Wastewater Management Plan, \n• Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for Rezonate!, and \n• Source Water Protection Plan for the O.B. Curtis Drinking Water Intake. \n \nMDEQ contracted with FTN Associates, Ltd. (FTN) to provide project management and \ntechnical support needed to develop the Rezonate plans. The Cirlot Agency joined with FTN to \ndevelop education and outreach programs and associated materials. An additional contractor, \nCDM Inc. (CDM), was responsible for development of the Pathogen Source Assessment and \nWastewater Management Plan. FTN and CDM coordinated work groups of local stakeholders \nand agency representatives to give input into all aspects of the planning process. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n2-1 \n2.0 WATERSHED DESCRIPTION \n \n2.1 Watershed Size and Location \nThe Ross Barnett Reservoir is an impoundment of the Pearl River just upstream of \nJackson, Mississippi (Figure 2.1).The Reservoir covers approximately 33,000 acres in Madison \nand Rankin counties. The watershed of the Reservoir covers approximately 3,050 square miles in \ntwelve counties: Attala, Choctaw, Hinds, Kemper, Leake, Madison, Newton, Neshoba, Noxubee, \nRankin, Scott, and Winston counties (Figure 2.1). The largest cities in the watershed are \nFlowood, Ridgeland, Madison, Philadelphia, Kosciusko, and Louisville (Figure 2.1). \nInterstate 20, US Highway 80, and Mississippi State Highway 25 pass through the watershed, as \nwell as the Natchez Trace Parkway (Figure 2.1). \n \n2.2 Land Use and Land Cover \n2.2.1   Current Land Use \nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service \n(NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is the most recent available land use inventory for the Ross \nBarnett Reservoir watershed. The CDL is a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data \nlayer with a ground resolution of 56 meters. In 2008, land use in the watershed was primarily \nforested (50%). Watershed land cover from 2008 is shown on Figure 2.2 and summarized in \nTable 2.1. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n2-2 \nFigure 2.1.

The Reservoir shoreline is an \narea of significant residential and commercial development in Rankin and Madison counties. \nResidential and commercial developments have lead to economic growth in northwestern Rankin \nCounty and southeastern Madison County, which currently experience the second and third \nhighest growth rates in the state. There is additional urban development in upstream watersheds, \nincluding the cities of Koscuisko, Philadelphia, and Louisville, and the towns of Forest and \nCarthage. \n \n2.2.3   Imperviousness   \nImpervious surfaces are areas that do not allow natural infiltration of rainfall to the \nunderlying soil. In the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed, these areas include roads, parking lots, \nand buildings. Yards and landscaped areas are considered somewhat impervious. They soak up \nsome water during rain events, but may generate runoff during intense storms or prolonged rain \nevents. \nThe most recent information available to quantify impervious surface area for the \nReservoir watershed was developed in 2006. This layer was developed by the Multi-Resolution \nLand Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) in conjunction with the 2006 National Land Cover \nDataset (NLCD). The layer classifies the imagery into 101 possible values (0% to 100%) to show \nthe estimated degree of imperviousness. \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n2-5 \nIn 2006, the percent impervious area in each 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC12) \nvaried from 7.4% to 0.2%, and averaged 0.3% The HUC12s with highest percentage of \nimpervious area are located near Pelahatchie Bay in Rankin County, and the cities of \nPhiladelphia and Louisville in the upper watershed (Figure 2.3). \n \n2.3 Reservoir and Watershed Characteristics \nThe Pearl River Valley Water Supply District maintains the Reservoir pool levels \nbetween 296 and 297.5 ft mean sea level (msl) during most conditions. The Reservoir’s surface \narea at pool elevation 296 ft msl is approximately 125 square kilometers (Lester Engineering and \nHarza Engineering 1959). With an average depth of 3 meters, the Reservoir is a shallow body of \nwa\n\nter. Basic dimensions of the Reservoir are shown in Table 2.2. \n \nTable 2.2. Reservoir dimensions with water level at 296 ft msl. \n \nParameter Value Units \nVolume                                                   382,538,243                                                   Cubic                                                   Meters                                                   \nSurface Area 125.4 Square Kilometers \nWatershed Area 7,889 Square Kilometers \nLength                                                           69.2                                                           Kilometers                                                           \nShoreline Length 169 Kilometers \nMaximum Depth 15.2 Meters \nMean Width 1.8 Kilometers \nMean Depth 3.0 Meters \n \nIn order to fully understand the present condition of the watershed, FTN developed a \ncomprehensive inventory of watershed characteristics (Appendix B), including the history of the \nReservoir, socioeconomics, natural resources, fisheries, and species of concern. Appendix B also \ndescribes the HUC12 watershed areas along with the physiographic regions, ecoregions, \nbioregions, wetlands, and aquifers in the Reservoir drainage area. Detailed descriptions of the \nclimate, geology, historical landuse trends, hydrology, and major tributaries are provided. \n \n\n \n \n \n2-6 \nFigure 2.3. Percent impervi\nous surface area by HUC12. \n \n \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n2-7 \n2.4 Water Quality Data \nWater quality data for the Reservoir and its watershed have been collected by several \nagencies including MDEQ; the US Geological Survey (USGS); the US Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA); the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH); the Mississippi \nDepartment of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP); and the National Park Service. The \nWater Quality Monitoring Plan includes an inventory of all available data. Appendix C includes \nan analysis of data for two large rivers in the Reservoir watershed, the Pearl River and the \nYockanookany River. Appendix D gives a summary of recent water quality data collected within \nthe Reservoir along with a status and trends analysis. Appendix E summarizes the results of fish \ntissue samples collected in the Reservoir.  \n \n2.5 Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection \nAppendix F includes descriptions of federal and state regulations that are relevant to \nrestoration and protection of water quality in the Reservoir and its watershed. Many of these \nregulations include permits issued to regulated facilities. MDEQ issues wastewater and \nstormwater permits in accordance with federal requirements. Permits include Stormwater \nManagement Plans for designated municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) areas and \nConstruction Stormwater Permits. Local governments issue ordinances that define stormwater \nmanagement requirements for counties and cities. \n \n2.6 Water Quality Impairments \nSection 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to identify waters that do not \nsupport their classified uses and to prioritize the impaired waters. The state then must develop a \ntotal maximum daily load (TMDL) for each pollutant causing the impairment. TMDLs are the \nmaximum amount of a given pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still maintain its \ndesignated uses. The presence of a TMDL for a waterbody is a key factor in selecting watersheds \nin need of restoration measures. In fact, the management measures recommended in this Plan \nwill share the same goals as TMDL implementation activities for individual waterbodies.  \nThe Mississippi Section 303(d) lists (2008 and 2010) include several stream segments \nlocated in the Ross Barnett watershed. Listed causes of impairment include biological \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n2-8 \nimpairment, sediment, pathogens, organic enrichment/low dissolved oxygen, and nutrients. \nMonitored waterbodies in the Ross Barnett watershed included on the draft 2010 303(d) list are \nlisted in Table B.8 in Appendix B. The 2010 list includes only monitored waterbodies. The 2010 \nlist is currently in draft format; however, final approval by the Mississippi Commission on \nEnvironmental Quality is anticipated. Table B.9 in Appendix B lists the completed TMDLs for \nwaterbodies within the Reservoir watershed and summarizes recommended pollutant reductions \nidentified in the TMDLs. Appendix G compares monitoring data collected from waterbodies \nwith TMDLs to waterbodies without TMDLs developed as of 2011. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n3-1 \n3.0 DESIGNATED USES AND DESIRED USES \n \n3.1      Regulated      Designated Uses of Streams \nDesignated uses for waterbodies are defined by MDEQ in the State of Mississippi Water \nQuality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters. This document describes the \nminimum water quality conditions applicable to all waters as well as specific requirements for \nparticular designated use classifications. MDEQ updates this document on a triennial basis, with \nthe most recent version approved in 2007.  \nAll streams in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed have the designated use of Fish and \nWildlife Support, with the exception of Warrior Branch, which is designated as an ephemeral \nstream. All waters of the state, except ephemeral streams, must meet the requirements for Fish \nand Wildlife criteria in order to support aquatic life. The criteria for Fish and Wildlife include \nnumeric criteria for dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and fecal coliform bacteria. The portion \nof the Pearl River upstream of the Reservoir is also designated for use as Public Water Supply \nand Recreation (MDEQ 2007). \n \n3.2 Regulated Designated Uses of Reservoir \nAccording to MDEQ standards, the Ross Barnett Reservoir is designated for use as public \nwater supply, fish and wildlife support, and recreation.  \nMDEQ standards state that waters classified for public water supply will be of sufficient \nquality that they will meet regulations established by the Safe Drinking Water Act after an \napproved treatment process. Specific criteria applicable to these waters include bacteria, \nchloride, specific conductance, dissolved solids, threshold odor, and radioactive substances. \nMDEQ also specifies maximum allowable levels for several specific chemicals: barium, fluoride, \nlead, and nitrate (as nitrogen).  \nWaters classified for use as recreation must be suitable for recreational purposes, \nincluding water contact activities such as swimming and waterskiing. MDEQ has established \nspecific criteria for bacteria, specific conductance, and dissolved solids for recreational waters. \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n3-2 \n3.3 PRVWSD Reservoir Purposes \nPRVWSD manages the Ross Barnett Reservoir for several purposes. The most significant \npurpose is water supply for the City of Jackson. The Reservoir provides raw water to be treated \nfor drinking water to the City of Jackson in accordance with a contract between the City of \nJackson and PRVWSD, dated November 18, 1959. Presently, the City of Jackson withdraws \nwater from the Reservoir under the terms and conditions of a water withdrawal permit issued by \nMDEQ’s Office of Land and Water Resources. Permit No. MS-SW-02419 allows the City to \nwithdraw a maximum volume of 30 million gallons per day (MGD) from the Reservoir. \nPRVWSD also manages the water for several other uses including recreation, residential \ndevelopment, flood mitigation, wildlife habitat, and fishing. \n \n3.4 Desired Uses of Streams and Reservoir \nIn addition to its regulated and designated uses, the Ross Barnett Reservoir has many \ndesired uses. Desired uses of waters are defined according to the community of stakeholders that \nlive in work in proximity to the waterbody. Although there are no specific criteria for desired \nuses, it is hoped that waters are maintained at a level of sufficient quality for desired activities. \nRecreational use of the Reservoir and parts of the Pearl River include boating, swimming, water \nskiing, fishing, and camping. The recreational opportunities and other amenities that the \nReservoir offers significantly increase the quality of life for residents.  \nThe Reservoir offers many desired uses that affect the economy of central Mississippi. In \nrecent years, real estate development in the shoreline areas of the Reservoir has grown at a rapid \npace. Property values of area near the shoreline of the Reservoir have generally increased in \nrecent years. Development of businesses that serve the growing community has accompanied the \nresidential growth. Water supply provided by the Reservoir has also allowed the development of \nindustries in central Mississippi. Among these is the Nissan North America, Inc., automotive \nplant located in Canton, Mississippi. \n \n3.5      Ecosystem      Services      \nEcosystem services are defined as the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems. While \nRoss Barnett Reservoir was designed and is managed to achieve the regulatory and designated \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n3-3 \nuses identified above, there are other benefits that are provided to people from this aquatic \necosystem. These ecosystem services include other benefits such as climate regulation, water \npurification, water regulation, sediment retention, and aesthetic enjoyment. These ecosystem \nservices are typically not included in most management plans because they are considered to be \n“free” to stakeholders living around and/or using the Reservoir. These ecosystem services and \nhuman uses associated with the services are listed in Table 3.1. One of the activities included in \nimplementing the Comprehensive Watershed Protection and Restoration Plan will be the \nquantification and economic valuation of these services so that a more complete estimate of \nwatershed protection and restoration benefits can be obtained. \n \n\n \n \n \n3-4 \nTable 3.1. Reservoir uses and ecosystem services.\n \n \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-1 \n4.0 LOCATIONS AND CAUSES OF WATER QUALITY ISSUES \n \nIn the Reservoir, as in most aquatic systems, a single pollutant cannot be identified as the \ncause of current water quality issues of concern. There are multiple issues impacting water \nquality: excessive sediment, nutrient enrichment, pathogens, invasive plant species, pesticides, \nand trash. \nThis section separately discusses each of the issues listed above by presenting the impact \nto water quality, characterizing its interaction with other pollutants, listing the waterbodies \nimpaired by the issue, and noting other locations of concern. Also, this section briefly describes \nthe sources of each issue, including human activities, that contribute pollutants to the Reservoir \nand its watershed. Appendix H gives a detailed inventory of pollutant sources.  \nThe most prevalent pollutant sources in the Reservoir and its tributaries are widely \ndistributed nonpoint sources originating from its watershed. In most cases, these nonpoint \nsources of pollutants cannot be easily quantified because information is not readily available to \npinpoint their locations or measure their pollutant loads. Consequently, indicators such as land \nuse, information on how various activities (such as urban development or timber harvesting) are \nmanaged, and inventories of pollutants typically present on those lands are used to describe the \nlikelihood for discharge of nonpoint source pollutants. Locations of regulated activities such as \nconstruction permits and confined animal feeding operations, and management plans for specific \nland areas (stormwater management plans, for example) are also indicative of actual or potential \nnonpoint sources of pollution. Regulated point sources of pollutants, although their impact is \ntypically smaller than nonpoint sources, are also included in the pollutant source inventory. \n \n4.1 Sedimentation and Turbidity \nSediment is caused by erosion of soil particles from land surfaces in the watershed and \ndetachment of soil from the banks and beds of tributaries of the Reservoir. The major factors that \naffect erosion include geology, climate, soil types, topography, vegetation, and land use \ncharacteristics. Climate factors include the amount and intensity of rain events and the \ntemperature. Soil characteristics are defined by the soil erodibility, which varies depending on \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-2 \nsoil characteristics such as composition (percent clay, silt, and sand) and organic composition. \nTopography describes the slope length, steepness, and shape of the slope. Land use \ncharacteristics include management practices such as erosion management practices used at \nconstruction sites and sites of land-disturbing activities. Maps describing these characteristics are \nincluded in Appendix B. \nExcessive sedimentation has been identified as the most significant water quality concern \nin the Ross Barnett Reservoir by several agencies including MDEQ, PRVWSD, the National \nResources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation \nCommission (MSWCC) (MDEQ 2009). In addition, the Pearl River Basin Team has identified \nthe following issues of concern (MDEQ 2000): \n \n• Sedimentation due to land disturbance adjacent to streams, and  \n• The impact of turbidity and suspended sediments on water quality. \n \nSedimentation and turbidity impact water storage capacity, fisheries, water quality, \naesthetics, and recreation in the Reservoir. In the watershed streams, sedimentation and turbidity \nimpact fish and other aquatic species, water quality, aesthetics and recreation. Sedimentation is a \nnatural and unavoidable process that occurs in reservoir systems, rivers, and streams. However, \nin the case of a reservoir, when sediment deposition rates exceed design conditions, the storage \nvolume and useful life of the reservoir are reduced. Due to its large wind fetch, sediments on the \nReservoir bottom are often resuspended due to wind and wave action. This concern is discussed \nin detail in Appendix I. \nSuspended sediment in the Reservoir and watershed streams may have a detrimental \nimpact on fish by reducing light penetration needed for growth of aquatic plants beneficial to the \nfish community, reducing areas for feeding and growth of young insects, and reducing viability \nof fish eggs. Other aquatic species may also be affected by sedimentation impacts to breeding \nand feeding habitats. Reduced visibility as a result of turbidity can make it more difficult for \npredators to locate prey. Sediments may also cover stationary aquatic species, such as clams. \nSuspended and deposited sediments are of additional concern because they may carry \nother chemicals into the water. Phosphorus is often associated with sediments because it readily \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-3 \nbinds to sediment particles washing from soils. Depending on the chemical properties of soil, \nother contaminants such as pesticides and metals can become sorbed to sediment particles and \ntransported to waterbodies during the erosion processes. \nSedimentation and turbidity also have aesthetic impacts. Sediment’s impact on water \ncolor and clarity can have a significant impact on the public’s perceptions of water quality in the \nReservoir and its tributaries. The color of the water in the Reservoir and resulting perceptions \nabout the quality of the water impacts shoreline property values and economic development in \nthe area.  \nSediments can also affect recreation and restrict boat access. Navigation of boats in some \nareas of the Reservoir is currently restricted due to shallow water depths. In addition, as noted \npreviously, turbidity can make it more difficult for fish to locate prey. This may impact \nrecreational fishing success. \n \n4.1.1   Locations   \nLocations where sedimentation and turbidity are causing water quality issues are \nsummarized in Table 4.1 and on Figure 4.1. Additional detail about these locations and causes is \nincluded in Appendix H.  \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-4 \nTable 4.1.

The water quality impacts of nutrient enrichment are a concern to many agencies \nand stakeholders involved in management of the Reservoir and its watershed.  \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-8 \nMonitoring data show that nitrogen and phosphorus are present in the Reservoir in \namounts in excess of what is needed for algae and other plant growth, which indicates that the \npotential for increased plant growth exists in this system. Data analysis (described in \nAppendix D) and a water quality model (described in Appendix J) indicate that algae growth in \nthe Reservoir is typically limited by light availability. On a national scale, results of the National \nClean Lakes Study showed that lakes with high nutrient levels were two and a half times more \nlikely to have poor biological health (EPA 2009). \nSome level of nutrients in the Reservoir is desirable because nitrogen and phosphorus are \nessential for healthy plant and animal populations, with each waterbody requiring the right \nbalance of nutrients to maintain aquatic life. However, a delicate balance must be maintained \nwhen managing the Reservoir for multiple uses. Literature review also shows that there is a clear \nlink between primary productivity and fish production, such that fish production suffers when \nnutrient levels are low (FTN 2007). \nParticular water quality concerns in the Reservoir related to nutrient enrichment and \neutrophication are drinking water quality, aquatic vegetation, and low dissolved oxygen \nconditions. In rivers and streams of the watershed, aquatic vegetation and low dissolved oxygen \nare the water quality concerns. \nHigh algal production is of concern for drinking water sources because some types of \nalgae cause objectionable taste and odor in drinking water. In addition, organic material resulting \nfrom algae present in raw water can form trihalomethanes when chlorine is added during the \ntreatment process. Levels of trihalomethanes are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nThese chemicals cause taste and odor issues in treated drinking water and can be harmful to \nhumans in high levels. MSDH routinely measures treated water at the O.B. Curtis plant for \ntrihalomethane levels. Recent measurements show levels are below allowable concentrations. \nAdditional detail is found in the Source Water Protection Plan. \nHigh levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waterbodies can allow excessive growth of \naquatic plants to occur under certain conditions. In the Reservoir, these plants can limit \nnavigation and access to shoreline areas. However, from the perspective of local fisherman, the \npresence of aquatic vegetation is desirable because it provides habitat and a food source for fish. \nSome local anglers feel that removing aquatic vegetation can have a negative impact on fish \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-9 \npopulations and fishing success (MDWFP 2009). In rivers and streams, excessive growth of \naquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation can slow flow, and potentially aggravate flooding \nconditions. In addition, some aquatic vegetation, such as stringy, slimy filamentous algae, are \nconsidered detrimental to the aesthetics of streams. \nAlgae and aquatic macrophytes can harm fish and other aquatic organisms as they die, \ndecay, and deplete oxygen levels. In reservoirs, anoxic conditions typically occur in deeper \nwaters of reservoir systems, below the photic zone, and may cause fish and mobile aquatic \norganisms to leave an area. Organisms that do not or cannot move to another location may die \ndue to lack of oxygen. These conditions also occur in rivers and streams in the watershed. Low \ndissolved oxygen conditions also trigger the release of chemicals bound to sediments, including \nphosphorus, manganese, and iron. These chemicals can cause noticeable problems with water \ntaste in waters used for drinking water source.  \n \n4.2.1   Locations   \nLocations of concern for nutrients and eutrophication are shown in Table 4.5 and on \nFigure 4.3.

PRVWSD has been actively managing alligator \nweed and water hyacinth for more than 10 years. Hydrilla, another non-native, invasive aquatic \nplant was found in the Ross Barnett Reservoir for the first time in 2005, and is also under active \nmanagement. In 2010, these three species accounted for approximately 18% of the aquatic plants \nin water less than 10 ft deep (alligator weed 11.9%, water hyacinth 5.2%, and hydrilla 0.9%). \nActive management of these non-native plants has resulted in reduced occurrence and \ndistribution of alligator weed and water hyacinth, and has slowed the spread of hydrilla \n(Cox et al. 2011). PRVWSD funds the aquatic invasive species program, and recent annual costs \nare given in Table 4.9. \n \nTable 4.9. Invasive species management costs. \n \nYear Cost* \n2007                                                                                                                  202,897                                                                                                                  \n2008                                                                                                                  234,550                                                                                                                  \n2009                                                                                                                  243,292                                                                                                                  \nAs of 9/30/2010 182,711 \n* Cost reflects only contract costs for aquatic spraying programs. Cost does not include PRVWSD personnel that supervise the \nprogram, actual costs are considerably higher. \n \nInvasive plant species are a concern because they grow quickly and out-compete native \nvegetation. Dense mats of aquatic vegetation can affect water quality by increasing the pH and \nwater temperature and causing decreases in oxygen under the mats. These may also stagnate \nwater, resulting in good breeding grounds for mosquitoes (GRI 2006). Vegetation mats can also \nblock boat navigation in some areas. \n \n4.4.1   Locations   \nMost aquatic plant species (native and invasive) are found in Pelahatchie Bay and the \nnort\n\nhern portion of the Reservoir where water levels and environmental conditions favor plant \ngrowth (Cox et al. 2011). The areas under active management for invasive aquatic plants include \nthe Reservoir upstream of Highway 43 and Pelahatchie Bay, shown on Figure 4.5 (Wersal et \nal. 2009).  \n\n \n \n \n4-17 \nFigure 4.5. Locations in the Reservoir \nwhere herbicides are applied for \ninvasive aquatic plant control. \n \n \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-18 \nDuring the plant surveys performed in 2010 and earlier, alligator weed, hydrilla, and \nwater hyacinth were found in the Pearl River in the area from the Low-Head Dam to the \nHighway 43 Bridge. These upstream river populations can serve as a source for infestation of the \nReservoir (Wersal et al. 2009, Cox et al. 2011). It is not known if other streams or lakes in the \nwatershed harbor aquatic invasive species. \n \n4.4.2   Sources   \nHydrilla was originally introduced into the United States in the 1960s as a plant for \naquariums. The original source of hydrilla and other invasive aquatic plants in the Reservoir is \nnot noted in GRI reports, but may have come from release to the environment of plants used in \nlandscaped areas. Tubers of hydrilla plants, which can remain in the soil layers of the Reservoir, \nhave been found in low densities. These tubers are a cause of re-infestation when the tubers grow \ninto plants. Hydrilla can also be spread by boats chopping up and carrying parts of the plants \naround the Reservoir (Wersal et al. 2009). Alligator weed and water hyacinth spread by water \nmovement and by humans and animals carrying the plants from one area to another. Any existing \nindividual plant of these species present in the Reservoir can act as a source for continuing \ninfestation. \n \n4.5      Pesticides      \nThere are thousands of commercially available pesticides at the present time. These \nchemicals are safe and efficient if applied using the correct methods and in the proper amounts. \nMost currently used pesticides are organic compounds that degrade quickly in the environment. \nHowever, pesticides can be toxic to humans, plants, and animals if used improperly (Mississippi \nState University Extension Service, Pesticides: Risks and Benefits). Excess levels of pesticides \nthat are applied to land near the Reservoir can unintentionally harm or kill native aquatic plants \nand animals. \nEPA has established criteria for many pesticides based on protection of aquatic life and \nhuman health. MDEQ uses these criteria in its water quality standards (MDEQ 2007). Recent \nsamples of raw water and water treated by the O.B. Curtis Plant showed that levels of \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-19 \n137 compounds classified as either pesticides or pesticide degradates were present at \nconcentrations below the EPA maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) (Rose et al. 2009). \nOther than the data collected from the O.B. Curtis Plant, there are no water quality \nmonitoring data for pesticide levels in the Reservoir and very little data for Reservoir tributaries. \nTributary data collected in the 1980s show that pesticide levels were less than laboratory \ndetection limits at the time the samples were collected. \nPesticides sold in Mississippi are regulated by the Mississippi Department of Agriculture \nand Commerce (MDAC), and must be certified by this agency before being sold in Mississippi. \nThe state chemist must also approve all pesticide products. Pesticide products must also be \nregistered and inspected by MDAC, and all dealers selling pesticides must register with the \nagency. Oversight of pesticides by MDAC is intended to protect the environment and the general \npublic from pesticide contamination and misuse\n1\n. \nPesticides in the Reservoir watershed are commonly applied to landscaped areas on both \na large scale (cities, counties, owners of large tracts of land used for forestry or agriculture) and \non a small scale (by homeowners on their yards). According to national data compiled by EPA \nin 2001, approximately 77% of pesticides used in the United States were for agricultural \napplications and 11% were used for home and garden purposes (Moore et al. 2007). \n \n4.5.1   Locations   \nPesticides of concern in the Reservoir include both insecticides and herbicides. Pesticides \npresent in water and sediments are an issue of concern for the entire Reservoir, especially the \narea near the O.B. Curtis drinking water intake.  \n \n4.5.2   Sources   \nPesticides in the areas closest to the Reservoir are applied by landowners on lawns, \nagricultural areas, and some managed forests. Pesticides may also be applied by professionals for \ntermite control in buildings and mosquito control in residential areas. These pesticides can reach \nwater when applied in excess amounts in areas where they may be carried by stormwater runoff. \n                                                \n \n1\n http://www.mdac.state.ms.us/index.asp, MDAC website, accessed March 22, 2010 \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-20 \nThe only pesticides known to be applied directly to the Reservoir are the herbicides used \nto manage aquatic invasive species. These herbicides are applied in areas north of Highway 43 \nand in Pelahatchie Bay during the growing season months of April through November \n(Figure 4.9). Herbicide application for invasive species is conducted according to the \nrecommendations of the Geosystems Research Institute at Mississippi State University. \nManagement activities for recent years are described in the report Littoral Zone Aquatic Plant \nCommunity Assessment of the Ross Barnett Reservoir, MS in 2010: A Six-Year Evaluation \n(Cox et al. 2011). Additional detail about pesticide sources is included in Appendix H. \n \n4.6 Trash Dumping and Litter \nManaging trash dumping and litter is a significant expense for PRVWSD. The district \nspends approximately $50,000 per year to remove trash from areas under their jurisdiction. \nAccording to PRVWSD, trash is a concern because of the potential for contamination of surface \nwater and groundwater, and the potential for insects, snakes, alligators and disease-carrying \nanimals to increase in littered areas. PRVWSD is also concerned that certain materials may be \ndangerous to recreational users of the Reservoir, including rusted cans, old batteries, rotting \ncarpets, empty coolers, barbeque grills and abandoned appliances.  \nTrash is a concern for wildlife that lives on or near the Reservoir and its tributaries. Birds, \nfish, and other mammals can be injured or killed if they ingest or become tangled in trash. \nMaterial such as glass and fishing line could cause injury to humans using the area for recreation. \nTrash such as containers that contain oil or paint or other substances can release chemicals \nharmful to water quality. In addition, trash directly impacts the aesthetic quality of an area and \nthe perceived value to its users. \nPRVWSD provides and maintains containers for trash at sandbar areas, picnic and \ncamping areas, and the surrounding parks, and posts signs to discourage people from littering. A \ncitizen group called Keep the Reservoir Beautiful has recently been organized and is working \nwith PRVWSD to combat littering.  \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-21 \n4.6.1   Locations   \nThe locations of most concern are sandbars located along the Pearl River between \nHighway 43 and the Low-Head Dam. These areas are frequently used by recreational boaters for \npicnicking and camping. A significant amount of trash and litter is often left behind in these \nareas. Trash that is not properly disposed of and removed from the sand bars is often blown in \nthe Pearl River or washed into it during rain events. This trash has the potential to eventually end \nup in the Reservoir. \nOther locations of concern include several parks located along the Reservoir shoreline, \nincluding Old Trace Park, Pelahatchie Shore Park, and Lakeshore Park. Trash that is deposited \ndirectly in the Reservoir may eventually end up on the Reservoir shoreline. It is expensive to \nremove trash from shoreline areas, especially those that are difficult to access. \n \n4.6.2   Sources   \nSources of trash from within the Reservoir include recreational users who are boating and \nfishing or using the parks and other shoreline areas. These users often leave trash behind in \nrecreational areas, which requires expensive cleanup (Figures 4.6 and 4.7). Other direct sources \ninclude trash from nearby residential areas and businesses that wind and stormwater carry into \nthe Reservoir. \n \n\n \n \n \n4-22 \nFigure 4.6. Trash dumping in recreational areas. \nFigure 4.7. Trash cleanup efforts. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n5-1 \n5.0 PRIORITIZATION AND TARGETING OF PROTECTION \nAND RESTORATION AREAS \n \nIt is not practical or affordable to simultaneously implement management measures in all \n87 HUC12s in the Reservoir watershed. The prioritization/targeting process works with \nmanageable-sized catchments (HUC12s) and ranks them as demonstrating high, medium, or low \nrestoration and protection priorities based on a set of characteristics that incorporate data \nindicative of potential pollution sources and management resources present in each HUC12. This \nwill allow Rezonate project managers to first implement restoration and protection measures in \nareas where they are needed most, and extend the measures to other areas after priority issues are \naddressed. Prioritization is based on two aspects of the HUC12s. \n \n• The need for restoration\n based on watershed characteristics that indicate the \nlikelihood for high pollutant levels to be contributed from the watershed.  \n• The need for protection activities to conserve existing resources, based on the \npresence of outstanding features that provide ecosystem services.  \n \nPrioritization is the process for identifying the HUC12s that have the greatest need for \nrestoration or protection. Targeting involves collecting additional information about high-priority \nHUC12s to identify those that have the greatest chance of improvement as management practices \nare developed and implemented.  \nProximity to the Reservoir affects the potential for pollutant sources to directly impact \nwater quality in the Reservoir; areas closer to the Reservoir have increased likelihood of \ncontributing pollutants. Pollutants originating from watersheds farther away from the Reservoir \nmay be removed before they reach the Reservoir through settling or biological transformation \nprocesses. Proximity and reduced travel time are considered in the prioritization criteria. In some \ncases, more stringent criteria were used for the 1x:10 watershed because pollutants originating in \nthese watersheds have a higher probability of reaching the Reservoir. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n5-2 \n5.1 Prioritization Method for Restoration \nThe method for prioritizing HUC12s consists of reviewing data available for a set of \nwatershed characteristics that indicate areas with the highest potential for current or future water \nquality issues due to the pollutants of concern. Prioritization characteristics have been developed \nfor each issue addressed in this plan: sediment, nutrients and currently used pesticides, \npathogens, aquatic weeds, and litter. Nutrients and currently used pesticides are grouped together \nbecause the same characteristics indicate the potential presence of these sources.  \nData for each of the characteristics were assembled for each HUC12. The characteristics \nused to prioritize the HUC12s for each issue are listed in Table 5.1. Each HUC12 was assigned \nan overall restoration priority for each issue based on the number of characteristics classified as \nhaving high restoration priority. Appendix K includes a description of the data sources used for \neach prioritization characteristic. \n \nTable 5.1. Prioritization characteristics for restoration. \n \nIssue Characteristic \nSediment \n• Percent developed areas by HUC12s \n• Percent of total waters with sediment TMDLs \n• Slope \n• Permitted sources most likely to contribute sediment (construction \nstormwater permits and surface mining permits) \n• Percent area with cropland landuse \nNutrients and \nPesticides \n• Percent of total waters with nutrient TMDLs \n• Percent area with cropland and urban landuses \n• Percent areas with pasture landuse \n• Permitted sources most likely to contribute nutrients (animal growing \noperations and wastewater treatment facilities) \nPathogens \n• Percent of total waters with pathogen TMDLs \n• Percent areas with pasture and urban landuse \n• Permitted sources most likely to contribute pathogens (animal growing \noperations and wastewater treatment facilities ) \nAquatic \nWeeds \n• Treatment locations \n• Locations identified during aquatic plant surveys \nTrash \n• Stakeholder-identified areas of concern  \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n5-3 \n5.2 Prioritization Method for Protection \nThe protection prioritization identifies HUC12s that have features considered important \nresource values for people and the environment. Characteristics used for protection prioritization \nare based on the Mississippi Watershed Characterization and Ranking Tool (MWCRT). MDEQ \ndeveloped the MWCRT for use in prioritizing watersheds on a statewide basis. The tool uses \navailable geospatial datasets to determine scaled scores for stressors and resource values for \nHUC12s. Resource value scores developed from the MWCRT were used to identify highest \npriority HUC12s for protection. This process is described in Appendix K. \n \n5.3      Prioritization      Results      \nThe overall prioritization for restoration activities in HUC12 watersheds was developed \nby overlaying the maps developed for each individual issue. Watersheds in which two or more \nissues were high priority were considered overall high priority areas for restoration (Table 5.2 \nand Figure 5.1). This resulted in a high-priority rating being assigned for thirteen HUC12s in the \n1x:10x watershed and six HUC12s in the area beyond the 1x:10x. The environmental or human \nwelfare protection scores that indicated high protection values are also noted in Table 5.2. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n5-4 \nTable 5.2.

The targeting \ncharacteristics are factors that cannot be quantified in a mapping exercise. Rather, they indicate \nthe watersheds in which watershed implementation plans would most likely be feasible, \ncost-effective, and successful. Professional judgment and discussion among the members of the \ntechnical advisory group were used to rank HUC12s for targeting based on the characteristics. \nTargeting characteristics are listed below. \n \n1. Willingness of landowners and local government to participate; \n2. Available funding sources (some funding sources have to be allocated to \nparticular landuse types or parts of the state); \n3. System responsiveness to management practices (i.e., immediate or quick \nresponsiveness); \n4. Pollutant issues that can be effectively addressed with management practices. In \ncomparison, issues such as historical sediment loads cannot be addressed by \nmanagement practices; \n5. Magnitude of the source and likelihood of achieving measurable benefits; \n6. Building on locations of past and ongoing management efforts; \n7. Public perception of the importance of water quality (i.e., public’s primary \nconcerns such as improved water clarity, higher property values, lower water bill, \nimproved recreational opportunities); \n8. Expected growth patterns, including areas for new development and retrofitting; \n9. Issues with permit compliance status of wastewater treatment facilities, with \nconsideration of the size of these facilities (higher load facilities targeted first); \nand \n10. Presence of septic tanks and onsite wastewater treatment plants in soils with \nlimited adsorption field suitability. \n \nBased on discus\n\nsion of the above criteria, the Technical Advisory Group selected three \nhigh-priority HUC12s for Phase 1 restoration measures (Mill Creek-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12, \nRiley Creek-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12, and Ashlog Creek-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12). One \nHUC12 that was not indicated as high priority for restoration, but does have a high value for \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n5-7 \nprotection, was targeted for Phase 1 protection measures (Lake Creek-Pearl River HUC12). \nInformation on the targeting criteria for HUC12s in the Pelahatchie Creek watershed is provided \nin Appendix L. The locations of these HUC12s are shown on Figure ES.2. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n6-1 \n6.0 PROTECTION AND RESTORATION GOALS \n \nThe protection and restoration goals for Ross Barnett Reservoir and its watershed reflect \nthe six issues driving Rezonate. Associated with the overall goals are 10-year goals. Following \nadaptive management, these 10-year goals will be revised in 10-year increments.  \n \n6.1 Sediment Issue Goals \nLong Term Goal\n: All the streams in the watershed have stable sediment regimes. \nTen-Year Goals\n: \no Twenty-five percent of the streams in the Pelahatchie Creek watershed will have \nstable sediment regimes in 10 years. Turbidity values in all watershed streams and \nin the Reservoir are attaining water quality standards.

The concept of green infrastructure, \na cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly approach to stormwater management, \nencompasses many of the management strategies recommended for the Reservoir watershed. \nGreen infrastructure has come to refer to stormwater management measures that utilize natural or \nengineered systems that mimic natural landscapes to capture, clean, and reduce stormwater \nrunoff through plant, soil, and biological processes. These measures may be used for new urban \ndevelopment or retrofits, to enhance existing pasture lands or row-crop fields, and to restore \ndisturbed rural areas. \nGreen infrastructure measures are designed to treat rain water close to the area where it \nfalls with designs that infiltrate and evaporate stormwater, use plants and soil to remove \npollutants, and allow for beneficial uses of excess stormwater. Green infrastructure principles \ndiffer from traditional development, which involves “hard infrastructure” such as curbs, gutters, \nand pipes that capture stormwater from impervious areas and quickly convey it into drainage \nditches and stormwater ponds with little treatment. Stormwater ponds control runoff rate, but do \nlittle to reduce the total runoff volume produced. In many cases, green infrastructure practices \nsuch as bioretention basins and vegetated swales can improve the pollutant removal efficiency \nand decrease maintenance costs of hard infrastructure. \nThis Plan includes nine overarching management strategies for the Reservoir watershed. \nThese strategies incorporate green infrastructure management principals to achieve water quality \ngoals. The strategies were introduced in the Executive Summary and are summarized below. \nThis section of the Plan discusses how these strategies can be applied in the Reservoir watershed. \n \n1. Maintain, and restore where possible, the existing riparian buffer zones along the \nReservoir shoreline and the banks of tributaries. \n2. Do not remove vegetation or disturb soils, if possible. If disturbed, minimize the \nexposure time of bare soils. \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-2 \n3. Control urban runoff within sites where it is generated, and reduce the quantity of \nstormwater and pollutants through capture, infiltration, and evapotranspiration. \n4. Use natural, bioengineering techniques to repair failing streambanks and eroding \ngullies. \n5. Adopt new ordinances or expand existing ordinances regulating land \ndevelopment, stormwater management, and landscaping if voluntary measures are \nshown to be insufficient. \n6. Continue public outreach and education by implementing the activities \nrecommended in the Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for Rezonate! \nfor each targeted audience. \n7. Work with federal, state, and local agencies to support conservation activities that \nare in progress on forested and agricultural lands and animal production. \n8. Develop and implement an incentive program to encourage the voluntary use of \ngreen infrastructure management measures. \n9. Focus Phase 1 restoration and protection efforts on targeted HUC12 \nsubwatersheds. \n \n7.1.1   Planning   Considerations   \nThere are many factors that need to be considered before selecting green infrastructure \nmeasures for specific areas. These include land availability and the acceptability of the measures \nto landowners. Without the participation of willing landowners, the measures cannot be installed. \nInstalling green infrastructure measures requires specialized planning and consideration of \nseveral factors: \n \n• Soil types and infiltration capacity; \n• Hydrology, including drainage area, slope, and water table depth; \n• Vegetation inhabiting the area in former years; and \n• Proper construction sequencing to avoid compacting of the soils. \n \nThe installation cost of green infrastructure measures along with annual maintenance \ncosts are important considerations. Developers may consider the initial cost of these measures to \nbe more expensive compared to traditional development methods. However, the use of green \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-3 \ninfrastructure has been shown to increase property values and decrease the cost of stormwater \nmanagement and treatment systems\n2\n. \n \n7.1.2   Benefits of Management Measures \nThe benefits of management measures can be measured in terms of (1) decreased \npollutant loads (measured in mass or percentage), (2) reduced stormwater quantity, and \n(3) fewer pollutant sources such as impervious surfaces, streams without buffer zones, failing \nseptic tanks, etc. The expected load reductions for this Plan will be based primarily on literature \nvalues for the percent pollutant reduction expected as a result of management measures.  \nAlthough they are based on current science, literature values should be used with caution \nbecause the efficiency of management measures is highly dependent on site-specific \ncharacteristics including input loads, soil types, existing vegetation, and storm intensity and \nduration. Often literature values suggest a range of expected pollutant reductions. Studies \nindicate that the performance of many measures is highly dependent on the influent \nconcentration, such that percent removal is generally greater when influent concentrations are \nhigher (American Society of Civil Engineers [ASCE] and EPA 2000). There are no known \nstudies of best management practice (BMP) efficiencies available for the Reservoir watershed \nand very few for the southeastern United States. Most BMP performance studies have been \nconducted in the northeastern United States, concentrated in the Chesapeake Bay region. \nThere are other benefits of management measures that are not easily calculated, but \nshould be considered in the overall effect. These include indirect benefits associated with \nbusiness development, increased tax revenues and jobs, recreation and tourism opportunities, and \nhealth. Studies have shown that green restoration and protection of the natural environment \nincreases property values, lowers crime through increased community pride and citizen \ninteraction, and fosters healthier communities (Benedict and McMahon 1996). \n \n                                                \n \n2\n EPA 2011.

Past activities include \nimprovement projects in two subwatersheds: Mill Creek and Fannegusha Creek. Ongoing \nactivities include stormwater management programs in urban areas, Reservoir management \nprograms conducted by PRVWSD, regulatory management of wastewater, and Farm Bill \nprograms that provide cost-share funds for measures in rural areas. Existing watershed \nmanagement activities are described in Appendix M. \n \n7.3 Recommended Management Measures for the Watershed \nThere are many management measures applicable for restoration and protection of the \nReservoir watershed. These measures can be categorized according to the land areas where they \nmay be applied, as follows. \n \n1. Upland green infrastructure and urban management measures, \n2. Instream management measures, \n3. In-Reservoir management measures, \n4. Enforceable mechanisms for developed areas, \n5. Forest land and timber-harvesting measures, and \n6. Conservation measures for lands used for agricultural production (pasture, row \ncrops, and animal growing). \n \nTables 7.1 through 7.6 list specific measures in each category and indicate the landuses \nwhere the measure can be effectively implemented. Appendix N includes Fact Sheets that \ndescribe these measures in detail. Fact sheets include design considerations, applicability, \npollutant removal efficiency, cost, benefits, limitations, and education needs. MDEQ’s Planning \nand Design Manual for the Control of Erosion, Sediment, and Stormwater also contains detailed \ninformation on design requirements for many of these measures (MDEQ 2011). \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-5 \nTable 7.1.

Conversion of land from undisturbed forest to urban \nareas results in increased peak flows during storm events and a higher frequency of \nchannel-forming flows. Research has shown that the discharge associated with storm events \nincreases significantly in urban streams. Higher flows in urban streams increase sediment loads, \ndestabilize stream banks, resuspend sediment in stream beds, and increase sediment transport to \nthe Reservoir. Selected upland management measures and their applicability in the Reservoir \nwatershed\n\n are described in Appendix O. Local governments in cooperation with resource \n                                                \n \n3\n Fact Sheet for this practice available from NRCS Conservation Practice Standards \nhttp://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/standards/nhcp.html \n4\n Ibid \n5\n Ibid \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-8 \nagencies (NRCS, MSWCC, MDEQ) should strive toward implementing these practices in the \nReservoir watershed. \nAs discussed previously, green infrastructure management measures are designed to treat \nstormwater in place through infiltration and evapotranspiration. Properly designed measures \nshould be able to meet specific criteria for retention, detention, erosion and sediment control, and \nwater quality planning. The criteria are given in Appendix S. \n \n7.3.2   Local Policy to Promote Green Infrastructure Management Measures \nLocal ordinances, zoning requirements, stormwater management plans, and \ncomprehensive plans play an important role in the use of green infrastructure in developing \nurban areas. Local policies can promote use of green infrastructure by treating it as “standard \npractice” rather than an alternative design. Local governments interested in promoting green \ninfrastructure should begin by reviewing their current policies. As an initial step, governments in \nthe Reservoir watershed can compare their policies to the Checklist of Recommended Elements \nto Promote Green Infrastructure (Table Q.1 in Appendix O). The checklist contains elements \nneeded in local policies to facilitate an effective green infrastructure program. Additional \nresources to assist local governments are included in Appendix O. \nOne highly recommended activity is that local governments form and actively participate \nin a local consortium of stormwater managers. The consortium would improve communication, \ncollaboration, and shared education programs among governments in the Reservoir watershed. \nThis would result in consistent programs for the watershed and potential cost savings by sharing \ntraining events and materials.  \n \n7.3.3   Stream Bank Restoration \nThe recommended approach for restoring eroding and failing stream banks relies heavily \non natural stream channel design. This approach, commonly called bioengineering, combines \nstructural components and native plant material to establish a dense living vegetation system in \norder to protect, as well as stabilize, stream banks and buffer zones.\n Bioengineering restoration \nprojects use a combination of structural and biological practices integrated with ecological \nconcepts to construct living plant communities that perform erosion, sediment, and flood control \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-9 \nwhen established. These projects use native plant growth to achieve pollutant reduction and bank \nstability (i.e., they expedite the recovery/restoration process by reestablishing native plant \ncommunities and stabilizing damaged banks after structures such as erosion control blankets, log \nrevetments, coconut logs, etc., have decomposed). The costs of installing bioengineering stream \nbank restoration can be expensive at first if local contractors are not familiar with these methods, \nbut costs are normally much cheaper than traditional erosion control methods. Specific methods \nof bioengineering are described in the Fact Sheets in Appendix N. Local governments should \nconsider using these methods in place of traditional bank grading and rip-rap. Agencies such as \nNRCS, the National Sedimentation Laboratory, and MDEQ may be able to provide technical \nassistance. \n \n7.3.4   In-Reservoir and Shoreline Management \nManagement measures needed for the Reservoir include reducing wind fetch and \nstabilizing the lake bottom. In-reservoir structures such as breakwaters or islands can reduce \nwind fetch and wind-generated waves. In-reservoir structures, however, are not a feasible \nmanagement option for the Reservoir due to high cost and navigation concerns. Establishment of \nwoody vegetation on the shoreline can stabilize soils and protect the shore from the energy of \nwind-induced waves, although large trees take many years to become established.  \nBased on visual analysis of recent aerial photography, approximately 25% of the \nshoreline has little or no vegetated buffer zone directly adjacent to the shore. However, there are \nno identified areas with bank failures on the Reservoir shoreline. Much of the shoreline has been \nstabilized with rip-rap or bulkheads. PRVWSD maintains constant water levels during the winter \nand summer seasons, which reduces the potential for shoreline erosion. \nReplanting shoreline areas with limited riparian vegetation has many benefits: pollutant \nremoval, wave reduction (if wetland vegetation), shoreline protection, and wildlife habitat \ncreation. The shoreline area of the Reservoir is managed by PRVWSD and individual lease \nholders. Lease holders are responsible for maintaining the shoreline on their individual lots. \nRezonate project managers can provide education and technical support to help landowners \nrestore and maintain shoreline vegetation. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-10 \n7.3.5   Education   Programs   \nThe common thread in all recommended management measures is stakeholder education. \nImplementation of many of the recommended management measures will rely on voluntary \nparticipation. The Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for Rezonate includes specific \nprogram goals and objectives for targeted audiences. The targeted audiences include the general \npublic, students and educators, civic groups, homeowners, developers/contractors, and decision \nmakers (FTN 2011). The most important actions needed to encourage participation in local \nparticipation are summarized below. Additional details are included in the Comprehensive \nEducation and Outreach Plan. \n \n• The public must begin to see the Rezonate logo, mascot, and materials on a \nregular basis. This requires attending local events on a frequent basis. A list of \nevents are attached in the education plan, but some of note are Pepsi Pops, Dragon \nBoat Races, 5k to10k running races and other sporting events held on or near the \nReservoir, and events at the Museum of Natural Science and the Children’s \nMuseum.  \n• The curriculum associated with Rezonate should be condensed into a marketable \nprogram that can be taken into schools as one-hour programs conducted by \noutside individuals for teachers and students. This will promote the use of the \nextended curriculum for Curriculum Challenge for schools in the watershed area. \nProject managers should partner with Keep the Reservoir Beautiful efforts to work \nlocal schools to co-promote both efforts. \n• Model areas for specific types of management measures need to be established in \ndifferent areas of the watershed. Measures include rain gardens and rain barrels, \nstreamside buffers, and vegetative stream bank restoration. Demonstration sites \nwill bring awareness of functionality and beauty as well as introduce stakeholders \nto the concept of green infrastructure. \n• Training workshops and/or other educational opportunities need to be held for \ncontractors, developers, and business and government officials. These educational \nopportunities may be aligned with a certification process for stormwater \nmanagement and other sediment/ pollution control measures. They may also be \nused to assist counties and cities meet education requirements for their stormwater \nmanagement plans. \n \n7.4 Restoration and Protection Measures for Targeted HUC12s \nThis section describes specific recommendations for management measures needed in \nsubwatersheds selected for the first phase of implementation activities. Members of the \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-11 \nTechnical Advisory Group approved the selected subwatersheds based on prioritization and \ntargeting results (Section 5.0). Three subwatersheds are targeted for restoration: Mill-Pelahatchie \nCreek, Riley-Pelahatchie Creek, and Ashlog-Pelahatchie Creek. One subwatershed is targeted for \nprotection: Lake Creek-Pearl River.  \nRestoration and protection objectives define the management measures needed in each \ntargeted subwatershed. These measures are considered to be the most critical in order to meet \nwater-quality goals.  \n \n7.5 Restoration Measures for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 \nThe Mill-Pelahatchie subwatershed is an important location for both watershed \nrestoration and source water protection activities. The restoration objectives for this HUC12 are \nas follows: \n \n• Objective 1: Incorporate green infrastructure stormwater management measures \nin new construction and retrofits; \n• Objective 2: Coordinate with Rankin County officials in matters related to \nstormwater management in developed areas; \n• Objective 3: Improve stormwater controls for construction on individual lots that \nare within a larger common plan of development; \n• Objective 4: Stabilize disturbed soils on construction sites and surface mines by \nquickly replanting with native grasses and other vegetation; \n• Objective 5: Identify and restore shoreline and streamside buffer zones and banks \nin needed areas, and repair eroding gullies; and \n• Objective 6: Leave undisturbed vegetated areas (green space) and \nshoreline/streamside buffer zones within new developments. \n• Objective 7: Develop an incentive program to encourage use of green \ninfrastructure management practices. \n \nThe total area of this HUC12 is 18,176 acres (approximately 28 square miles). \nHydrologic soil group (HSG) classifications are needed to determine the feasible management \nmeasures for a particular area. Infiltration measures will work well on soil types A and B (very \nwell and well-drained soil types).

HSG types in the Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-14 \nThe Mill Creek-Pelahatchie HUC12 contains the highest percentage of impervious \nsurface area within the Reservoir’s drainage area (7.4% based on 2006 NLCD; see \nSection 2.2.3). Increased erosion is presently occurring on upland areas in Rankin County as well \nas along the banks and in the beds of Mill Creek and Turtle Creek. Rapid development near these \ncreeks has resulted in the removal of natural vegetation, leaving exposed soils and causing \nelevated wash loads of sediment from construction sites. Homeowners along the Pelahatchie Bay \nshoreline have complained of poor water clarity and reduced water depth due to settling of \nsuspended sediments. \nIt is likely that a significant amount of sediments are presently stored in the channels and \nfloodplains of Mill Creek and other tributaries. These sediments originate from erosion \nassociated with past landuses such as row-crop agriculture and development that occurred prior \nto regulatory control of construction sites\n6\n. Modeling estimates indicate that as much as 65% of \nthe sediments in the streams presently in this watershed can be attributed to instream sources \n(i.e., bank and bed erosion), and the remainder is attributed to land use in the watershed (see \nAppendix P for explanation of the model). \nSediments from erosion associated with past landuse activities are referred to as “legacy \nsediments.” Legacy sediments can be resuspended and washed towards the Reservoir during \nhigh-flow events. Eventually all of the legacy sediments will be washed downstream, but this \nprocess may take decades or even hundreds of years (Langland and Cronin 2003). \nSediments have caused high turbidity and navigation problems in Pelahatchie Bay, \nregardless of whether they are legacy sediments or originate from present-day construction sites \nand surface mines. A combination of watershed erosion control and vegetative stream bank \nstabilization is recommended to prevent excessive sediment wash-off into the creeks and to \nreduce suspended sediment levels. \n \n                                                \n \n6\n NPDES stormwater regulations have been implemented in two phases. Phase I (1990) required stormwater permits \nfor construction activities impacting 5 acres or more. Phase II (2003) required stormwater permits for construction \nactivities impacting 1 acre or more. \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-15 \n7.5.1   Implement Urban Green Infrastructure Stormwater Management \nMeasures \nSeveral types of green infrastructure stormwater management measures are \nrecommended for the Mill-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12. Table 7.8 lists recommended management \nmeasures and indicates the drainage area or distance in the watershed where each proposed \nmeasure could be effectively applied. The areas and distances given in Table 7.8 refer to the \ndrainage area or distance that would generate runoff treated by the measure, not the actual \nfootprint of the treatment measure. Suites of measures can be used in many areas to create a \n“treatment train” to increase overall pollutant removal. In this case, the areas treated by different \nmanagement measures will overlap. Table 7.8 is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of \nmanagement practices, but features green infrastructure measures that are recommended for this \nsubwatershed. \nNew development area is based on the estimated area with active construction permits \n(674 acres as of August 2010) and the assumption that growth will continue at 110% of the \ncurrent rate in this area (712 acres per year)\n 7\n. The areas for urban retrofits are based on the \nassumption that the measures would be applied to 10% of the developed area with applicable soil \ntypes\n8\n. Additional assumptions are listed in the notes below the table.  \nThe areas/distances given in Table 7.8 should be interpreted as preliminary estimates of \nareas where management measures may be implemented. They do not refer to specific parcels of \nland. Rather, they refer to areas with the soil type and landuse where measures are feasible. \nFigure 7.3 shows developed areas in the HUC12 that contain suitable soil types. Specific parcels \nwill be identified based on landowner willingness and funding sources available when individual \nwatershed implementation plans (WIPs) are developed. \n \n                                                \n \n7\n The assumed growth-rate is an estimate and has not been verified. The growth rate will be adjusted based on local \ndata to be obtained for individual watershed implementation plans and compared with permits issued for new \ndevelopment. Information from the Central Mississippi Planning and Development District may also be used to help \nrefine the growth rate estimate.  \n8\n The application of management measures to 10% of developed area is an assumption based on professional \njudgment. Based on review of watershed management plans in other regions, it is reasonable to assume that a \nmaximum of 10% of the drainage area will be treated with green infrastructure measures. Funding resources and \nlandowner willingness are the most common limiting factors. \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-16 \nTable 7.8.

It is assumed, for example, that bioretention basins will remove 85% of \nthe sediment contained in stormwater treated within the basin. \n \n7.5.2   Coordinate with County Officials \nCoordination with local Rankin County officials will be necessary to promote the use of \ngreen infrastructure stormwater management measures. Rezonate project managers will ensure \nthat the county has access to fact sheets describing green infrastructure management measures \nand other reference material. The recently updated Planning and Design Manual for the Control \nof Erosion, Sediment, and Stormwater (Planning and Design Manual) contains additional \ninformation about green infrastructure measures such as open space design, protection of natural \nfeatures, street design and patterns, and urban forestry (MDEQ 2011).  \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-19 \nProject managers will assist county officials with reviewing the Checklist of \nRecommended Elements to Promote Green Infrastructure (Appendix O) and implementing \ndesired changes. Implementation of the Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for \nRezonate will provide additional training and incentive programs to assist local decision makers \nand developers/contractors. \n \n7.5.3   Improve   Stormwater   Controls on Individual Lots \nOne of the most significant problems within developing areas near the Reservoir is \nimproper installation and maintenance of construction BMPs on individual lots within \nsubdivisions. Education for developers/contractors and increased presence of regulatory \nauthority is needed to improve compliance. The City of Flowood is already working to \nimplement these measures (City of Flowood Public Works Director, February 2011).  \nEducation is needed to promote understanding of the importance of controlling sediments \non construction sites. Developers and contractors must take daily responsibility for proper \nmaintenance of construction site BMPs and must be aware that they are working within the \nReservoir watershed and that pollutants from construction sites in this watershed negatively \nimpact the quality of its water used for drinking and recreation.  \nLocal governments in this watershed are positioned to provide oversight of installation \nand maintenance of construction site erosion and sediment control measures through existing \nlocal stormwater plans and related ordinances. Local governments in cooperation with staff \nmembers involved with MDEQ’s Ross Barnett Reservoir Stormwater Compliance Initiative will \ncontinue to conduct frequent inspections of construction sites in this subwatershed and issue \npenalties when needed. The current activities of the Stormwater Compliance Initiative are \ndiscussed in Appendix H, Section 1.2. \n \n7.5.4   Stabilize Disturbed Soils \nMuch of the soil in this subwatershed is silt loam classified by NRCS as “highly \nerodible.” Consequently, it is imperative to stabilize exposed soils on construction sites as soon \nas possible after clearing and grading. Proper sequencing of activities on construction sites is the \nmethod most commonly used to minimize soil exposure. In this method, only areas scheduled for \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-20 \nimmediate construction activities are cleared, instead of clearing the entire site at one time. A \nplan for construction sequencing is required in SWPPPs. Specifications for this management \npractice are included in MDEQ’s Planning and Design Manual (MDEQ 2011). Contractors and \ndevelopers working within the Reservoir watershed must carefully consider their construction \nsequencing plan and take special precautions to minimize the exposure of highly erosive soils. \nThe recently proposed Construction General Permit by EPA\n9\n calls for immediately \nstabilizing areas where earthwork will stop for more than 7 days, or has been completed. \nStabilizing measures (soil conditioning, seeding, mulching or non-vegetative techniques) must be \ninstalled within 3 days of stopping or completing work. MDEQ’s Large Construction \nStormwater Permit\n10\n allows for a stop-work period of 14 days before stabilization is required, \nand allows 7 days to install stabilizing measures.  \nSurface mining sites must fully comply with MDEQ requirements for site stabilization \nand BMPs for erosion and sediment control. Presently there are three permitted surface mines in \nthis subwatershed. MDEQ’s Stormwater Compliance Initiative has issued fines for mines in the \nPelahatchie Creek watershed that were operating without proper management practices, and \nidentified several unpermitted surface mines (Appendix H). MDEQ continues to work with \nexisting mine operators to improve stormwater control. In order to reduce sediments originating \nfrom erosive soils near the Reservoir, MDEQ might consider limiting future surface mining \nactivities allowed in this HUC12. If the facility is granted a permit, MDEQ should conduct an \nextensive review of the facility’s SWPPP prior to the issuance of permits and perform frequent \ninspections (at least every other month and following heavy rain events) during operation. \n \n7.5.5   Restore Stream Banks and Buffer Zones and Repair Gullies \nTable 7.9 lists management measures for stream banks and gullies in the Mill-Pelahatchie \nHUC12. The table includes preliminary estimates of stream length where restoration measures \nmay be needed. Specific areas will be identified during the development of WIPs. \n \n                                                \n \n9\n http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/cgp.cfm \n10\n http://deq.state.ms.us/MDEQ.nsf/page/epd_epdgeneral?OpenDocument \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-21 \nTable 7.9.

Assume that vegetative stream-bank stabilization measures are needed along 10% of the sediment TMDL segments in the \nMill-Pelahatchie HUC12 (528 ft), along with 1,000 ft of Mill Creek and 1,000 ft of Turtle Creek. Bioengineering measures \nshould remove nearly 100% of the TSS at each location.  \n2.     Gullies based on assumed length; will be revised based on field reconnaissance. \n3.     Assume restored riparian buffer zones needed along 25% of all streams; total stream distance in the Mill-Pelahatchie \nHUC12 is 5.1 miles. The 25% assumption was chosen because approximately 25% of the watershed is developed. For cost \nestimates, we assumed that half of the streams would need restoration on both sides and half would need restoration on one \nside only.\n \n \nExcessive bank erosion and loss of stream-bank vegetation has been observed in many \nstreams in this HUC12 including Mill Creek (Figures 7.4 and 7.5). As of May 2011, planning is \nunderway for a project to stabilize a 350-ft section of Mill Creek located just south of Spillway \nRoad (depicted on Figure 7.4). This is one of a few sites in the subwatershed being considered \nfor vegetative- and soil-bioengineering stabilization techniques \nVegetative stabilization and soil bioengineering techniques are recommended for streams \nin this watershed. Based on preliminary analysis, longitudinal rock dikes built parallel to the \nstream may be needed to prevent further bank scouring and stabilize bank toes. Instream \nstructures (jetties made of posts, logs, or rock) may be needed to protect stream banks in curves \nby reducing high-velocity currents that occur during peak flows. Soil stabilization (using coir \nfiber, brush layering, and erosion control matting) may be needed to provide substrate for \nvegetative stabilization measures and to capture sediment and dissipate energy. Native plant \nmaterials and grasses should be planted on the stabilized stream bank. Specific engineering plans \nwill be needed for sites once they are selected. Implementing these techniques will require a \ncoordinated effort between the property owners, technical resource agencies, and entities \nproviding funding. \n\n \n \n \n7-22 \nFigure 7.4. Mill Creek south of Highway 25; right descending bank looking upstream. \nFigure 7.5.

Mill Creek stabilized with rip-rap. \nThe Rankin County Board of Supervisors recently completed bank stabilization on \nportions of Mill Creek near residential areas. The stabilization work consisted of bank grading \nand placement of rip-rap on the banks. This type of stabilization is effective. However, it often \nleaves stream channels without riparian zones that regulate temperature (via shading) and \nprovide wildlife habitat (Figure 7.6). Rankin County is planning to work with adjacent property \nowners to replant vegetation in this section of Mill Creek (George Bobo, Rankin County Road \nManager, May 2011, personal communication). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-24 \nRezonate project managers will work with Rankin County officials and local \nstakeholders to identify additional locations where stream-bank stabilization measures are \nneeded. Field reconnaissance (i.e., visual observation conducted by walking along streams) is the \nbest method to identify locations where stream-bank stabilization is needed. However, field \nreconnaissance is time-consuming and difficult when streams are not readily accessible. The \nRankin County Board of Supervisors conducted low-level aerial photography in portions of \nRankin County on two recent occasions\n11\n. It may be possible to identify stream segments with \ninsufficient riparian vegetation and locations of active bank failures with a close examination of \nthe following sets of high-resolution aerial photographs: \n \n• High-resolution aerial photographs of Mill Creek watershed collected in the fall \nof 2006, \n• High-resolution aerial photographs of Rankin County collected in the fall of 2008, \nand \n• Two-foot topography contours developed using LIDAR data for all of Rankin \nCounty based on the 2008 photos. \n \nA sediment budget that delineates upland and instream sources would be helpful to \nidentify specific locations where management measures are needed. However, attributing \ncumulative sediment loads to individual sources is difficult without detailed information. A \nliterature review (Appendix Q) describes the information and methods used to develop sediment \nbudgets in other parts of Mississippi and other states. \nThe Technical Advisory Group reviewed a scope of work and cost estimate to develop a \nsediment budget for the Reservoir watershed (prepared by the Bidenharn Group, Appendix R). \nThis proposal includes collecting a geo-referenced, aerial video and ground-truthing selected \nareas to pinpoint locations of significant sediment sources in the watershed. At this time, the \ngroup has not made a decision on whether to move forward with this work. \nGullies tend to form easily on any area of exposed soil, due to the highly erosive nature \nof soils in the Reservoir watershed. Once formed, gullies typically grow with time and will \ncontinue down-cutting until resistant material is reached. They also expand laterally as they \n                                                \n \n11\n Photography can be obtained by contacting Lance Cooper, Rankin County Tax Assessor’s Office.  \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-25 \ndeepen, making them a major sediment source. Presently, there is not an inventory of gullies in \nneed of repair in the Reservoir watershed. Rezonate project managers will work with county \nofficials and local citizens to identify locations. The fact sheet on gully repair (Appendix N) \ndescribes repair methods for gullies of various sizes. \n \n7.5.6   Maintain Green Space and Undisturbed Streamside Buffer Zones \nThe current zoning ordinance in this watershed includes requirements for open space. \nThe amount of land designated as open space varies within each particular zone, but ranges from \n15% to 30%. Open space is defined as “parcels of land not occupied by dwellings or residential \nstructures, accessory structures and yards ... and which is permanently maintained in a suitable \nstate for the shared enjoyment by the owners and/or occupants.”\n12\n \nThe undeveloped, “green\" portions of the open space (i.e., areas left as natural vegetation \nand trees) are important for water quality because they reduce and treat stormwater. Structures \nsuch as tennis courts and swimming pools may be built in open space and offer valuable \nrecreational and social benefits for residents. However, they reduce the amount of open area that \nis left as green space.  \nCurrent zoning ordinances do not specify the amount of the open area that must be left as \ngreen space. Rules to limit impervious area in future developments would reduce the quantity of \nstormwater generated from future development. Model ordinances suggest that 50% of open area \nshould be preserved as green space\n13\n.  \nThe City of Flowood has zoned some areas as land conservation areas\n14\n. Zoning \nordinances limit certain uses of the conservation areas. The areas are reserved for future growth \nonce the city has established streets and utilities in these areas. This ordinance i\n\ns intended to \nencourage development in parts of the city that are already served by streets and utilities. This \nprovision is consistent with green infrastructure principles because it reserves large tracts of \nundeveloped land and encourages urban growth in an orderly manner. Rankin County has zoned \n                                                \n \n12\n Zoning Ordinance of Rankin County, Mississippi, Revised December 2010.

PUDs preserve open space in subdivisions \nby allowing smaller lot sizes. \nMaintaining vegetated buffer zones along drainage channels and streams is an effective \nway to remove pollutants from stormwater and protect stream channels from degradation. Buffer \nzones are highly cost-efficient if disturbance of the buffer zone is initially avoided. Buffer zones \nfor streams have been shown to be one of the most effective methods of reducing water pollution \nand sedimentation in streams (Department of Defense 2004, Fisher and Fischenich 2000, and \nMississippi Forestry Commission [MFC] 2002).\n Additional regulatory controls to prevent \ndisturbance of riparian buffer zones in new developments is recommended for the \nMill-Pelahatchie HUC12. Although they represent an additional level of regulatory control, \nbuffer zone requirements for new developments could be easily incorporated into the \nreview/approval process for site development plans. They could be added as an item for \ninspections that are already required for sites under construction. \n \n7.5.7   Develop and Implement an Incentive Program \nMany of the management measures recommended for this subwatershed will depend on \nthe willingness of individual landowners to implement them on their property, often at their own \nexpense. Cost-sharing programs for urban areas are not widely available. Because of this, it will \nbe important to provide an incentive program to encourage adoption. Possible incentives include \ntax credits, expedited permit approval, grants, awards, and recognition. There are also many \nbenefits of green infrastructure stormwater management practices, including reduced stormwater \ntreatment costs and community benefits such as increased recreational opportunities and \naesthetics.  \nAs a first step, Rezonate project managers must work with Rankin County to develop the \nprogram. There are several resources available to assist local governments in developing an \nincentive program, including EPA’s Managing Wet Weather with Green Infrastructure \nMunicipal Handbook: Incentive Mechanisms. \n15\n \n \n                                                \n \n15\n http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_munichandbook_incentives.pdf \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-27 \n7.5.8   Cost Estimates for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Objectives \nInitial estimates of the cost to implement the management measures recommended for \nthis subwatershed have been developed.

It presently contains some development extending from the City of Flowood and \nthe area near Fannin. New development in this HUC12 must be planned and managed in the \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-28 \nsame manner recommended for the Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12. This HUC12 also contains large \nforest and pasture areas. The restoration objectives for this HUC12 are as follows: \n \n• Objective 1: Address compliance issues at the Reservoir East publicly owned \ntreatment works (POTW) and encourage all new homes and buildings to connect \nto a central sewer system (most soils are not suitable for septic tanks), \n• Objective 2: Incorporate green infrastructure stormwater management measures \nin new construction, \n• Objective 3: Preserve streamside buffers and green space as new development \nexpands to this area, \n• Objective 4: Stabilize disturbed soils on construction and surface mining sites by \nquickly replanting with native grasses and other vegetation,  \n• Objective 5: Implement pasture management measures on all areas with willing \nlandowners, and \n• Objective 6: Encourage participation in forestry stewardship programs. \n \nThe total area of this HUC12 is 33,292 acres (approximately 52 square miles). Land use \nsummary by HSG type within the watershed is presented in Table 7.11 and on Figures 7.7 \nand 7.8. \n \nTable 7.11.

The Reservoir East Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has had past \npermit compliance issues and operational problems and has been the subject of several public \ncomplaints (CDM 2010). This facility discharges into Pelahatchie Creek, approximately 4 miles \nupstream of Pelahatchie Bay. Because it discharges upstream of a waterbody that is used for \ndrinking water supply and contact recreation, MDEQ must quickly move forward to address \ncomplaints and compliance issues. The Ross Barnett Reservoir Pathogen Source Assessment and \nWastewater Management Plan (Wastewater Plan) recommends decommissioning the facility and \nconnecting it to a regional wastewater treatment system when a connection becomes available. \nThose areas that remain on septic tanks will be targeted for homeowner education programs to \nteach proper septic tank installation and maintenance. \nOpportunities to improve onsite wastewater treatment in this subwatershed include \nincreasing availability of a central wastewater collection system and improving performance of \nexisting onsite treatment systems. A new wastewater collection line is planned for the eastern \nshore of the Reservoir that will connect to the City of Jackson’s WWTP (located in the Pearl \nRiver downstream of the Reservoir). The new collection line may allow homes and businesses \ncurrently served by onsite wastewater treatment systems to connect to the central collection and \ntreatment system.   \nSeptic systems are viable options for treating wastewater in rural areas as long as they are \nproperly maintained. However, the Wastewater Plan indicated that as many as 65% of the septic \ntanks in this area may be failing due to poor soil conditions. Decentralized wastewater treatment \nsystems are an option for areas that are currently served by septic tanks (subdivisions, \nbusinesses, and schools). Decentralized systems work well in areas that are already served by \nseptic systems and need to improve wastewater treatment. In this case, the septic tank provides \nprimary treatment (solids settling) from individual homes. After primary treatment, water from \nmany systems is collected, treated through additional processes, and disposed of through \nmethods such as underground drip irrigation.  \nThe Wastewater Plan identifies subdivisions located near the Reservoir that are now \nserved by septic systems. Presently, there are 16 subdivions (Baker Lane Farms, Biltmore \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-31 \nEstates, Fox Run, Holly Bush, Kitty Hawk, Lake Harbor Estates, Langford Farms, LeBourgeois \nEstates, Mellowmeade, North Brandon Ridge, North Brandon Estates, Oak Ridge Estates, Old \nFannin, Persimmion Creek, Shenandoah Estates, and Virginia Valley) and several unnamed \nhigh-density residential areas that are not served by central sewer systems. Based on current \nrecords, these subdivisions contain 625 homes with the potential to contain approximately \n1,000 homes when the subdivisions are fully built. These areas would be good candidates for \ndecentralized systems as well as homeowner education programs about properly maintaining \nseptic systems. \n \n7.6.2   Implement Green Infrastructure Stormwater Management Measures \nPotential areas for implementation of green infrastructure stormwater management \nmeasures in the Riley-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12 were estimated using assumptions similar to \nthose used for the Mill-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12. Table 7.12 lists recommended management \nmeasures and indicates the drainage area or distance potentially served by each type of measure. \nNew development areas are based on the estimated area with active construction permits \n(240 acres as of August 2010) and the assumption that growth will continue at 110% of the \ncurrent rate in this area (264 acres per year). The areas for urban retrofits are based on the \nassumption that measures are applicable to 10% of the developed area with applicable soil types. \nAdditional assumptions are listed in the notes below the table.  \nThe areas/distances given in Table 7.12 are preliminary estimates of areas where \nmanagement measures may be implemented.

Then, assume that 10% of newly \ndeveloped areas with type B and 5% with type C and D will have bioretention systems. \n2. Assume that 80% of impervious area drains into stormwater retention/detention basins, and retrofits will be needed at 10%. \nExisting development is 17% impervious (HUC12 impervious area/HUC12 developed area); assume new development will be \nthe same (45 acres). Assume 75% of new impervious areas will drain into a stormwater detention/retention basin.  \n3. Assume 17% of developed area (existing and new) on type B soils is impervious (see note 2). Infiltration retrofits applied to \n10% of the developed impervious area with type B soils. Assume that 10% of new impervious areas with type B soils will have \ninfiltration systems. \n4. Constructed wetlands applied to 10% of existing developed impervious area regardless of soil type. Assume that 10% of new \nimpervious areas will have constructed stormwater wetlands.  \n5. One demonstration project for retrofits of impervious area with pervious pavements is recommended (one project at 0.5 acre). \nAssume that pervious pavement is applicable for 1% of new impervious areas. \n6.

Assume rooftop area is 10% of impervious area, and \nbuildings average 2,000 square feet. \n11. PUD management principles used on 25% of new development. \n12. 50% of newly developed areas will use tree preservation. \n13.

Although they represent \nan additional level of regulatory control, buffer zone requirements for new developments could \nbe easily incorporated into the review/approval process for site development as the area \ncontinues to grow. Section 7.5.6 of this Plan and Section 4.4 of Appendix O provide additional \ndiscussion of the importance of streamside buffer zones and options for implementing them. \nTable 7.13 provides a preliminary estimate of the stream length where restoration measures may \nbe needed. Specific areas will be identified during the development of WIPs. \n \nTable 7.13.

Five percent was selected because approximately 5% of the watershed is developed. \n \n7.6.4   Stabilize Disturbed Soils \nAs development continues in this watershed, it is imperative to minimize erosion from \nnew construction sites. Also, surface mining sites must fully comply with MDEQ requirements \nfor BMPs for erosion and sediment control and site restoration. Presently there are three \npermitted surface mines in this subwatershed. The recommendations given in Section 7.5.4 for \nthe Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 should also be applied in this HUC12 to minimize erosion and \ntransport of sediments from construction sites and surface mines. \n \n7.6.5   Implement Pasture Management Measures \nThe Riley-Pelahatchie subwatershed includes more than 5,200 acres of pasture land. \nNRCS and MSWCC have worked extensively with owners of pasture land throughout the \nPelahatchie Creek watershed to assist with nutrient management and grazing measures. Many \nowners of pasture land have already implemented conservation measures on their lands including \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-34 \nfencing, rotational grazing, and access control to keep livestock out of streams, coupled with \nalternative water sources\n16\n.  \nAlthough there are no poultry-growing operations located in this HUC12, it is likely that \npoultry litter from other operations is transported into this subwatershed for use as fertilizer. The \nuse of poultry litter depends on the cost of manufactured fertilizer versus the cost of transporting \npoultry litter. The NRCS poultry-litter transport cost-sharing program has made the use of \npoultry litter as a fertilizer cost-effective. Although the exact number is not known, it is \nreasonable to assume that 15% to 20% of pasture lands and row-crop fields receive poultry litter \nas a fertilizer (Murray Fulton, February 2011, personal communication). Proper nutrient \nmanagement is necessary to protect water quality downstream of pastures treated with poultry \nlitter.  \nMDEQ reports that the most common type of complaint reported for land application of \npoultry litter is odor (William Ryder, November 2010, personal communication). These \ncomplaints are usually due to third-party users applying the litter (i.e., producers who are \npurchasing the litter from a facility permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination \nSystem (NPDES) program that is located in another subwatershed). Third-party users may be \nrequired to develop nutrient management plans and should follow nutrient management \nguidelines when applying litter to pastures.  \nPasture management measures recommended for participating landowners include buffer \nzones near streams and at the edge of fields. These measures enhance green infrastructure and \nwildlife habitat while protecting water quality. According to NRCS, some landowners have \nadopted these measures\n17\n; however, increasing their use in this subwatershed is recommended \n(Murray Fulton, NRCS, February 2011, personal communication). A cooperative effort between \nNRCS and MDEQ will prioritize future projects in this HUC12. Estimated areas are given in \nTable 7.14.  \n                                                \n \n16\n EQIP-funded practices in the entire Reservoir watershed totaled 15,542 acres of access control; 258,584 linear feet \nof fence; three stream crossings; and 85 watering facilities from 2007 to 2010. It is not known how much of these \nareas are located in the Riley-Pelahatchie HUC12. \n17\n EQIP funded 7 acres of field borders and 807 acres of filter strips between 2007 and 2010. These areas apply to \nthe entire Reservoir watershed. Areas within individual HUC12s are not available. \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-35 \nTable 7.14.

Assume that fencing of pastures with alternative water source and stream crossings is needed in 25% of  pasture land. \n2.     Assume field borders/filter strips are applicable to 2% of pasture areas. \n3.     Riparian buffer zones applicable to 15% of total length of streams. The total length of streams in the Riley-Pelahatchie \nHUC12 is 23.6 miles. This assumption was selected because pasture land is 15% of the total watershed area. \n4.     Nutrient management applicable to 20% of pasture area. This is the assumed percentage of pasture land treated with poultry \nlitter. \n \n7.6.6   Promote   Forestry Stewardship \nThere are 16,445 acres of forested land in the Riley-Pelahatchie HUC12. Forested area \ncontributes significantly less runoff and nonpoint source pollutants on a per-acre basis than other \nlanduses. Measures recommended for forest areas will retain the function of green infrastructure \nnear sensitive areas and minimize the impacts of forest harvesting. A recent survey conducted by \nMFC reported that 93% of the BMPs surveyed on recently harvested forest land were \nimplemented in accordance with the guidelines published in Mississippi’s BMPs – Best \nManagement Practices for Forestry in Mississippi (MFC 2011). \nConservative management of forested land in the Riley-Pelahatchie HUC12 is important \nfor protecting the overall watershed health and water quality of the Reservoir and its tributaries. \nMFC has several programs available to assist private landowners manage their land such as the \nForest Stewardship Program and the Forest Resources Development Program (see Appendix M). \nHowever, data from MFC show that there is very little participation in these programs within the \nRiley-Pelahatchie HUC12. Increased awareness of these programs among landowners may \nincrease participation in this area. \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-36 \nSpecific forestry management measures are included in Table 7.15. Since most forest \nland in the Reservoir watershed is managed by private landowners, the annual amount of forest \nland harvested each year is not known. An assumed rate of 4% forest land harvested per year was \nused to develop this table. This rate is based on information from MFC (MFC 2008). \n \nTable 7.15.

Properly designed skid trails and landings applicable to 4% of all forest land. \n2. Streamside management zones applicable for 4% of the length of the estimated length of streams in forested areas. \nEstimated length of streams in forested areas is 11.7 miles (49.4% of the total stream distance; 49.4% of watershed is \nforested). \n3. Forest regeneration area is 4% of all forest land. \n4. Participation in conservation easements depends on willingness of private landowners to participate.  \n \n7.6.7   Cost Estimates for Riley-Pelahatchie HUC12 \nInitial estimates of the cost to implement the management measures recommended for \nthis subwatershed have been developed. Table 7.16 includes a summary of costs for \nimplementing the management measures recommended for the Riley-Pelahatchie HUC12.

This HUC12 was targeted for restoration because it is \nlocated in the headwater region and contains most of the City of Pelahatchie. City leaders have \nexpressed interest in working to implement recommended watershed improvements. There is \nsome urban development in the City of Pelahatchie. However, the watershed is predominantly \nforested land with some pasture and a small amount of row-crop agriculture. The restoration \nobjectives for this HUC12 are as follows: \n \n• Objective 1: Incorporate green infrastructure stormwater management measures \nin new construction and retrofit projects in the City of Pelahatchie, \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-38 \n• Objective 2: Preserve streamside buffers and green space as development \ncontinues in this area, \n• Objective 3: Assist poultry growers to ensure that they have access to technical \nexpertise and cost-sharing programs needed to implement nutrient management \nplans, \n• Objective 4: Implement pasture management measures and BMPs for agricultural \ncrops on all areas with willing landowners, and \n• Objective 5: Address flooding concerns through evaluation of Pelahatchie \nCreek’s flow capacity. \n \nThe total area of this HUC12 is 31,817 acres (approximately 50 square miles). Land use \nsummary by HSG type within the watershed is presented in Table 7.17 and on Figures 7.9 \nand 7.10.  \n \nTable 7.17.

Table 7.18 lists recommended management measures and indicates the \ndrainage area or distance potentially served by each proposed measure. \nNew development areas are based on the estimated area with active construction permits \nin August 2010 and the assumption that growth will continue at 110% of that rate in this area \n(66 acres per year). The areas for urban retrofits are based on the assumption that the measures \ncould be applied to 10% of the developed area with applicable soil types. Additional assumptions \nare listed in the notes below the table.  \nThe areas/distances given in Table 7.18 are preliminary estimates of areas where \nmanagement measures may be implemented. They do not refer to specific parcels of land. \nRather, they refer to areas with the soil type and landuse where the measure is feasible. \nFigure 7.11 shows developed areas in the HUC12 that have suitable soil types within developed \nareas. Specific parcels will be identified based on landowner willingness and funding sources \navailable when individual WIPs are developed. \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-41 \nTable 7.18.

Although they \nrepresent an additional level of regulatory control, buffer zone requirements for new \ndevelopments could be easily incorporated into the review/approval process for site development \nas the area continues to grow. Section 7.5.6 of this Plan and Section 4.4 of Appendix O provide \nadditional discussion of the importance of streamside buffer zones and options for their \nimplementation.

Seven percent was selected because approximately 7% of the watershed is developed. \n \n7.7.3   Assist   Poultry   Growing Operations \nThere are 11 permitted poultry-growing operations in the Ashlog-Pelahatchie Creek \nsubwatershed as of August 2010. According to MDEQ records, these facilities are presently in \ncompliance with their permit requirements. Management measures applicable to poultry \nproduction include management of litter, waste storage facilities, and animal mortality facilities. \nAll poultry facilities with NPDES permits must have a comprehensive nutrient management \nplan. NRCS typically assists producers in the development of these plans. Nutrient management \nplans are developed on a site-specific basis and include a review of the chemical content of the \npoultry litter, how and where it is applied, and the soil types on which it will be applied. NRCS \nleads efforts to assist poultry operations in the state. Rezonate project managers will coordinate \nwith NRCS to encourage producers to implement nutrient management and other conservation \nmeasures.  \n \n7.7.4   Promote Agricultural Management Measures \nThe Ashlog-Pelahatchie subwatershed includes more than 6,200 acres of pasture land. \nBecause there are several poultry growing operations in this subwatershed, it is likely that \npoultry litter is used as fertilizer on some pasture areas. Nutrient management is an important \nfactor for improving water quality among owners that apply poultry litter to their fields. Pasture \nmanagement measures are discussed further in Section 7.5.6. Table 7.20 provides an estimate of \nthe areas where pasture management measures are applicable. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-44 \nTable 7.20.

Assume that fencing of pastures with alternative water source and stream crossings is needed in 25% of pasture land. \n2. Field borders/filter strips are applicable to 2% of agricultural land (row crop + pasture areas). \n3. Riparian buffer zones applicable to 22% of total length of streams. The total length of streams in the Ashlog-Pelahatchie \nHUC12 is 23.5 miles. This assumption was selected because agricultural crops + pasture land is 22% of the total watershed \narea. \n4. Nutrient management applicable to 20% of pasture area. This is the assumed percentage of pasture land treated with poultry \nlitter. \n \nRow-crop agriculture accounts for a small percentage of the land in this subwatershed \n(approximately 845 acres, or 3%). Applicable conservation measures depend on the types of \ncrops that each individual producer is growing. Row-crop production in this watershed is \ndominated by soybeans, winter wheat, and cotton\n18\n. However, the crops grown year-to-year \nchange according to market prices. Prices for corn and soybeans have increased recently, and \nmore producers have been growing these crops (Patrick Vowell, MSWCC, personal \ncommunication). \nMost producers in the Reservoir watershed are already using reduced-till or no-till \nsystems along with residue management. Because herbicide-resistant cotton seeds are now \navailable, no-till systems are frequently used for cotton crops (Murray Fulton, NRCS, \nFebruary 2011, personal communication). According to NRCS, many producers have also \nincorporated terraces into their fields to minimize soil and nutrient loss during storm events.  \nField borders and filter strips are additional measures recommended for both row-crop \nagriculture and pasture lands. These measures enhance green infrastructure; provide wildlife \nhabitat; and remove sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants from stormwater runoff. A field \n                                                \n \n18\n Based on 2009 CDL Landuse Data \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-45 \nborder is typically placed around the entire outside edge of a field. Filter strips are placed on the \nlow end of a field, so that they will intercept the stormwater washing off of a field. The area \nrequired for both measures is a 35-ft wide strip around the perimeter of the row-crop area or on \nthe low end of the field respectively\n19\n. To minimize loss due to removing lands from planting or \ngrazing, these measures can be installed in shaded or wet areas that are not usually high \nproduction areas. \nField borders and filter strips can be funded through the Conservation Reserve Program \n(CRP) administered by the Farm Service Agency. It is advantageous for producers to use this \nprogram because it allows for annual funding with respective installations on those areas where \npractices were used\n20\n. \nTable 7.20 gives the agricultural measures that are recommended for the \nAshlog-Pelahatchie subwatershed. In support of this Plan, NRCS and MDEQ will work to \nprioritize proposed projects in this HUC12 for cost-sharing funds. \n \n7.7.5   Evaluate Pelahatchie Creek Flow Capacity \nA significant concern for the City of Pelahatchie is flooding in some portions of \nPelahatchie Creek and its tributaries. A study of the flow capacity of Pelahatchie is needed to \nevaluate specific causes of flooding and recommend corrective action. The study could also \nidentify actions needed to improve recreational opportunities along Pelahatchie Creek. With \nproper planning and management, the creek could be developed as a “blue way” to promote use \nby canoers, kayakers, and hikers. \n \n7.7.6   Cost Estimates for Ashlog-Pelahatchie Creek \nInitial estimates of the cost to implement the management measures recommended for \nthis subwatershed have been developed. Table 7.21 includes a summary of costs for \nimplementing the management measures recommended for the Ashlog-Pelahatchie HUC12. \n                                                \n \n19\n http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/standards/nhcp.html NRCS practice codes 386 (field borders) and 393 (filer \nstrips) \n20\n As of March 2010, there were 128,000 acres enrolled in the CRP program in counties within the Reservoir \nwatershed.

This \nsubwatershed is a relatively undisturbed area that contains many ecological features that are \nimportant for long-term protection of water quality. Specific protection measures are \nrecommended to maintain the ecological integrity of these areas. The measures recommended for \nthis watershed include education and outreach activities, rather than structural practices. For this \nreason, the estimate is included in the Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for \nRezonate. The protection objectives for this HUC12 are as follows: \n \n• Objective 1: Maintain wetlands, streamside buffer zones, and undisturbed green \nspace, \n• Objective 2: Partner with Keep the Reservoir Beautiful to curb littering by \nrecreational boaters,  \n• Objective 3: Use education programs to promote a sense of pride and \nresponsibility for environmental preservation of this area, and \n• Objective 4: Promote conservation easements through partnerships with nonprofit \nland conservation groups. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-47 \nThe total area of this HUC12 is 22,508 acres (approximately 35.17 square miles). The \nsubwatershed is situated in parts of three counties: Madison, Rankin, and Scott. Land use \nsummary by HSG category within the watershed is presented in Table 7.22 and on Figures 7.12 \nand 7.13. \n \nTable 7.22.

Long-term \nmanagement and protection of the above-mentioned natural features are needed in order to \npreserve their water quality functions. The Lake Creek-Pearl River HUC12 presently has very \nlittle development. The intent of this Plan is not to prevent future development, but rather \nminimize its impact on the natural features. Future development in this watershed must b\n\ne \ncarefully planned using Low-Impact Development\n21\n and Better Site Design\n22\n principles. \nStormwater impacts from development can be mitigated with the use of the many green \ninfrastructure management measures discussed in this Plan. \n                                                \n \n21\n http://www.epa.gov/owow/NPS/lid/ \n22\n http://www.cwp.org \n\n \n \n \n7-48 \nFigure 7.12. Landuse in the Lake Creek-Pearl River HUC12. \nFigure 7.13. HSG types in the Lake Creek-Pearl River HUC12. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-49 \nMost of the developed areas in the subwatershed are associated with the Natchez Trace \nnear the north boundary, and Highway 25 near the south boundary. The majority of the land is \nclassified as forested land, most of which is managed by private landowners. It is likely that \nsome forest land in this subwatershed is harvested on a regular basis. Rezonate project managers \nshould work with MFC to be sure that landowners use proper harvesting measures to manage \nrunoff, and are aware of the opportunities to participate in forestry stewardship programs. \nApproximately 22% of this watershed is currently classified as wetlands. It will be of \nparamount importance to protect these wetland areas from the impacts of development and land \ndisturbance. Recommendations listed below are based on the Center for Watershed Protection’s \npublication Using Local Watershed Plans to Protect Wetlands (Cappiella et al. 2007)\n 23\n. \n \n• Use land use planning techniques to redirect development and preserve \nsensitive areas. This will require a coordinated effort between Madison, Rankin, \nand Scott counties. It is unlikely that there will be significant development within \nthis subwatershed in the next 10 years. However, county governments must \nconsider the importance of protecting wetlands in this subwatershed if asked to \napprove any future development plans. Governments should require the use of \nenvironmentally sensitive designs such as “cluster development” if housing \ndevelopments expand to this area. \n• Identify wetland areas as priority areas for conservation. Place wetlands in a \nland trust when feasible. Avoid land-disturbing activities, such as timber \nharvesting, near wetlands. Use pasture management measures to keep livestock \nout of sensitive streams and wetland areas. \n• Establish vegetated buffers of at least 50 ft around all wetlands. This will \nprotect wetlands from negative impacts of development. \n \nAdditional provisions to protect wetlands and natural features of this subwatershed \ninclude guiding future development with new ordinances, requiring strict erosion and sediment \ncontrol on any construction sites (including roads), and restricting certain types of land \ndisturbance activities (i.e., surface mining, clear cutting, industrial development). However, these \nwould have to be developed by the county governments with the input of landowners in order to \nminimize the burden of land use restrictions on private property owners.

The Keep the Reservoir Beautiful organization \nhas been formed by citizens in order to help promote voluntary methods for reducing littering \nand encouraging clean-up of existing trash on these sand bars. PRVWSD is working with the \norganization to bring the problems with litter to the attention of the public using newspaper \narticles, volunteer opportunities, clean-up days, and other activities. Public relations activities \nshould continue throughout the recreational season (May through October) each year. \nProviding an annual “report card” on littering is an excellent public relations tool to build \ninterest and encourage residents and build support for the Keep the Reservoir Beautiful \ncampaign. The Comprehensive Water Quality Monitoring Plan describes a monitoring approach \nfor developing and tracking a litter index after holidays when heavy use of the sand bars is \nexpected. Results of litter index monitoring should be shared with the public in conjunction with \nthe organization’s public relations activities. \n \n7.8.3   Implement Educational Programs \nEducational programs implemented for protection of this subwatershed should focus on \nthe targeted audiences that most frequently use this area. Many people use the land in this \nsubwatershed for recreational activities such as boating, fishing, water skiing, and hunting. Thus, \nthis group has a vested interest in preserving watershed health and the quality of its water. The \nComprehensive Education and Outreach Plan includes specific objectives for civic and \nrecreational groups. One objective is to partner with influential boaters and campers who are \nprominent figures in social outings on the Reservoir (e.g., Flag Island regulars) to encourage \nclean recreational activities. The bottom-line message for educational programs is that \npreservation of this subwatershed is necessary for clean water in the Reservoir. In turn, clean \nwater is necessary for continued recreational enjoyment of the Pearl River and waters \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n7-51 \ndownstream to the Reservoir. Improved quality of life and higher property values are among the \nmany benefits of clean water. \n \n7.8.4   Promote Conservation Easements and Land Trusts \nConservation easements can be used to protect natural and cultural features of land. \nParticipation in conservation easements is voluntary. Easements typically restrict certain uses of \nproperty such as development or significant disturbance of vegetation within the easement area. \nHowever, owners retain access and continued ownership of the property. A conservation \neasement is recorded as a written legal agreement between the landowner and the holder of the \neasement. The holder may be either a nonprofit conservation organization or government agency. \nIn Mississippi, conservation easements are usually donated to nonprofit conservation \norganizations, commonly known as land trusts. A land trust is a local, regional, or national \nnonprofit organization that protects land for its natural, recreational, scenic, historic or \nproductive value. \nThere are a number of federal and state programs, particularly agriculture and wildlife \nprograms, that provide incentives and financing to purchase easements and enter into \nconservation agreements. CRP makes annual lease payments to participating landowners. \nParticipation in CRP requires placing highly erodible crop or pasture land into grasses and \nwoody vegetation. The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) applies to lands that have been \npreviously converted from wetlands to crop or pasture land. Other programs include Grasslands \nReserve Program (GRP) and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP). \n \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n8-1 \n8.0 IMPLEMENTATION \n \nThis section provides a schedule and preliminary budget for implementing the \nComprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan along with the other plans developed as part of \nthe Ross Barnett Reservoir Initiative. \n \n8.1      Schedule      \nThe implementation schedule includes the protection and restoration activities described \nin Section 7 and the Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for Rezonate!, the Source \nWater Protection Plan for the O.B. Curtis Drinking Water Intake, and the Water Quality \nMonitoring Plan. For flexibility, schedules were developed based on the amount of time elapsed \nsince the start of implementation (i.e., year 1, year 2) in lieu of specific years. Funding may not \nbe available for all targeted subwatersheds at once; thus, a staggered start-up schedule may be \nused. This will enable Rezonate project managers to track progress based on the start date of \nimplementation activities. The schedule in Table 8.1 specifies the milestones, responsible party, \nand timeframe for management measures. Watershed Implementation Teams (WITs), along with \nMDEQ, are the primary responsible parties. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n8-2 \nTable 8.1.

These actions include both \nvoluntary and regulatory approaches. Voluntary approaches center around installation of the \ngreen infrastructure management measures and improved control of pollutant sources. If needed, \nregulatory approaches will include modifications of ordinances and stormwater regulations. \nFollowing development of WIPs, WIT members should meet on a routine basis to evaluate \nwhether the milestones are being met. The WIPs will include schedules for installing practices \non specific parcels of land. \n \n8.1.2   Source Water Protection Plan \nImplementation of the Source Water Protection Plan also includes voluntary and \nregulatory measures. Many of the recommended source water protection measures overlap with \nmeasures in the Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan, especially in the targeted \nMill-Pelahatchie Creek subwatershed, which overlaps with the primary protection area. \nThe Source Water Protection Plan contains a list of recommended actions and a schedule \nfor implementing the actions (see Table 3.1, Action Plan Summary, in the Source Water \nProtection Plan). The source water protection work group, formed to develop the plan, will \ncontinue to oversee implementation of the plan. The group will be lead by MDEQ and include \nmembers from MSDH, PRVWSD, and the City of Jackson. At a minimum, this group should \nmeet annually to evaluate yearly progress. \n \n8.1.3   Education and Outreach \nWatershed management and nonpoint source pollution reduction in the Reservoir is a \ncommunity-centered activity that will require voluntary participation and cooperation of many \nindividuals in order to meet goals. Thus, a strong educational component is an important part of \nthe implementation strategy. The Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan defines the \nspecific actions needed to educate and involve key target audiences.  \nThe plan includes a recommended schedule and budget for implementation over a 5-year \nperiod along with evaluation criteria. This schedule complements watershed protection and \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n8-4 \nrestoration activities. A review of evaluation criteria should be conducted on a yearly basis to \nanalyze progress, determine if goals are being met, and make needed adjustments. After the first \n5-year period, project managers should conduct a comprehensive review of the success of the \nprogram and continue with a revised program.  \n \n8.1.4   Monitoring   Plan   \nMDEQ will determine the implementation schedule for the monitoring plan based on the \nfunding and personnel available for sampling and laboratory analysis. The monitoring plan was \ndeveloped as individual modules that specify different types of monitoring. MDEQ can choose to \nimplement all of the modules or only selected modules during specific times. At a minimum, the \nbase monitoring, biology, and pathogen sampling should be conducted to track long-term water \nquality status and trends. Also, monitoring of priority subwatersheds with WIPs should be \nconducted to track improvements during pre- and post-implementation. \nAs management measures are implemented, it will be important to measure water quality \nimprovements and the effectiveness of the measures. Often, long and uncertain lag times occur \nbetween implementation and measurable water quality improvements. However, measurable \nprogress is critical to ensuring continued support of watershed projects among local leaders and \nthe general public.  \n \n8.2      Budget      \nThe funding for implementation of the Rezonate plans will come from several sources. \nPersonnel from agencies participating on implementation teams will be funded by regular agency \nbudgets. Stakeholders from the community may participate on the watershed teams on a \nvoluntary basis. Installation of management measures will be funded through cost-sharing \nprograms such as Section 319(h) and the NRCS EQIP program. Most likely, property owners \nwill be responsible for long-term maintenance of structural management practices. Preliminary \nbudgets for the Rezonate plans are summarized below (Table 8.2). It is important to note that \nthere are many benefits that go along with the investment in green infrastructure stormwater \nmanagement measures and other water quality improvement practices recommended in this plan. \nThese benefits may be quantified when specific implementation sites are selected. \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n8-5 \nTable 8.2.

Environmental indicators are direct \nmeasurements of water quality conditions (i.e., reduced sediment and nutrient levels, improved \nbiological health, and fewer stream bank failures). Evaluation criteria are one of the required \nelements for Section 319(h)-funded watershed plans, summarized in Appendix U. \nManagement measures recommended in this document will be updated through an \nadaptive management process as they are implemented and evaluated for performance. This will \nimprove the quality and efficiency of program implementation.  \nRezonate project managers must track progress based on both programmatic and \nenvironmental indicators and compare these to annual project costs. Programmatic evaluation \ncriteria are given in Table 9.1. The criteria include parameters that can be measured with a \nreasonable level of effort and compared from year to year. If changes are needed, the program \nmanagers need to evaluate potential solutions and have the authority to decide which solutions to \nimplement.  \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n\n\n \n \n \n9-2 \nTable 9.1.

Environmental indicators. \n \nPollutant Indicators \nSediment \n• Measurements of TSS and water clarity (Secchi depth) at base \nmonitoring stations. \n• Measurements of turbidity at the drinking water intake (measured by the \nCity of Jackson). \n• Estimates of sedimentation rates in selected parts of the Reservoir \n(tons/year or inches/year) measured with a bathymetric survey and \nestablished sediment ranges OR sediment cores. \nNutrients \n• Measurements of nitrogen and phosphorous and chlorophyll-a at the \nbase monitoring stations. \n• Increased dissolved oxygen levels measured in the hypolimnion near the \ndam and at diel monitoring stations. \nPathogens \n• Measurements of fecal coliform bacteria at routine monitoring sites \n(existing sites and new sites). \n• Number of water quality standard exceedances measured near \nrecreational areas. \nPesticides \n• Measurements of pesticide levels in the water column and fish tissue. \nLitter \n• Trash index scores measured by Keep the Reservoir Beautiful. \nInvasive Species \n• Annual survey results for aquatic invasive vegetation. \n \n9.1 Annual Review and Adaptive Management \nRezonate project managers should review the programmatic and environmental \nindicators on an annual basis. Programmatic indicators can be compared to the short-, mid-, and \nlong-range goals. Environmental indicators will be compared to water quality criteria and short- \nand mid-range goals. If indicators fall short of the goals, project managers will need to evaluate \nthe reasons for this and make appropriate changes to the program. \nWhen programmatic indicators are measured at less than 50% of the short- and mid-range \ngoals and environmental indicators do not meet goals or show progress towards meeting goals, \nproject managers should consider making changes to program implementation in order to \nincrease participation. If voluntary measures are lacking, the incentive program should be \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n9-4 \nevaluated and increased as budgets allow. Regulatory mechanisms (stricter ordinances and \nzoning requirements) should be considered when programmatic indicators are less than 50% of \ngoals and environmental indicators fail to meet goals.  \n \n9.2 Program Inputs, Outputs, and Outcomes \nRezonate project managers should evaluate the inputs, outputs, and outcomes of the \nprograms related to each area of deficiency. Results of this evaluation will help managers \ndetermine ways to improve program implementation. Inputs\n define the amount of time and \nresources put into implementation of the Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan, such \nas the following: \n \n• What resources are available to implement the program? This includes personnel \ntime and funding for implementation of management measures. If there are \nspecific needs that are not being met, identify these needs and look for resources \nthrough grants and cost-share programs. Funding is likely to be a significant \nlimiting factor for implementation of WIPs. \n• Are there sufficient experienced staff and technical resources available to properly \nimplement the Plan? Are staff members well trained? If not, identify options for \ntraining. Do project managers have the authority to make decisions regarding \nimplementation? If not, some modifications to project management may be \nneeded to ensure timely decision-making. \n \nOutputs\n refer to administrative accomplishments from implementing the plan. Most \noutputs can be measured with programmatic indicators (Table 9.1). Examples of outputs are \nshown below: \n \n• Is the schedule for implementation of management measures (Table 8.1) being \nmet? Because many of the management measures are voluntary, lack of \nlandowner participation may be a limiting factor. If landowners are not willing to \nfinance the cost of installing practices, project managers may need to assist them \nwith finding cost-share programs. Landowners may also be hesitant due to lack of \ninformation about management practices. If this is the case, education activities \nand incentives may improve participation. \n• Are goals for number/miles of management practices being met? If not, watershed \nimplementation teams may need encouragement and guidance to increase \nimplementation. Project managers should be aware, however, that the goals \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n9-5 \nestablished in this plan are preliminary. Some adjustment may be needed when \nimplementation begins. \n \nOutcomes\n refer to measurements that show improvements in water quality or fewer \npollutant sources. Outcomes are important to track because they document the end result of \nimplementation activities: improved water quality. Even if the outcomes do not show positive \nresults they should be shared with stakeholders because they provide clearly understood \nfeedback about project results. Some outcomes are listed below: \n \n• Have concentrations or loads of the pollutants of concern decreased? This can be \ndetermined by comparing monitoring data to past results.  \n• Do we have less trash accumulating on the Pearl River sandbars? This can be \ndetermined by surveys conducted by Keep the Reservoir Beautiful Litter Index \nand by tracking litter clean-up costs. \n \n\n \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n10-1 \n10.0 REFERENCES \n \nCarpenter, S.R. 2005.

Background and Planning Process October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nA-1 \nWhat\tis\tRezonate?\t\nRecognizing the importance of the Ross Barnett Reservoir, the Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District (PRVWSD), \nalong with the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Mississippi Soil and \nWater Conservation Commission (MSWCC), initiated planning to restore and protect water \nquality in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. This effort, initially called the Ross Barnett \nReservoir Initiative, has been branded as Rezonate!.  \n \nSeveral\tplans\thave\tbeen\tdeveloped\tas\tpart\tof\tRezonate.\tWhat\tare\tthe\t\nplans\tand\twhy\tdo\twe\tneed\teach\tof\tthem?\t\nThe planning stage of the Ross Barnett Reservoir Initiative project included the \ndevelopment of several watershed management planning documents. The documents are listed \nbelow and described in this summary. Together, these five documents will lay out a \ncomprehensive approach for managing water quality in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. \n \n• Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan, \n• Pathogen Source Assessment and Wastewater Management Plan, \n• Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for Rezonate!, \n• Water Quality Monitoring Plan, and \n• Source Water Protection Plan for the O.B. Curtis Drinking Water Intake. \n \nThe Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan has been developed to provide a \ncoordinated approach for managing the Reservoir and its watershed, specifically addressing \nissues of greatest concern (sediment, nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, invasive species, and \ntrash). The purpose of the Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan is to identify \nstrategies for restoration of the Reservoir’s impaired tributaries and to promote protection of the \nReservoir and its watershed to reduce the potential for future degradation due to other issues of \nconcern. This Plan is a technical document and is intended for use by resource agencies and \norganizational personnel responsible for administering environmental programs in the watershed.  \n\nAppendix A  \nRezonate! Background and Planning Process October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nA-2 \nThe Plan is comprehensive in scope and describes the current conditions in the Reservoir \nand its watershed based on current water quality data and input from resource agencies, local \nstakeholders, and associated teams. The Plan provides a detailed characterization of the \nwatershed, including geography, climate, geology, soils, land use, and water quality data. The \nPlan also describes the natural resources present in the watershed and accounts for ongoing water \nquality management and monitoring activities in the area. \nNext, the Plan describes six high-priority issues of concern in the Reservoir and its \nwatershed and recommends management measures for reducing and controlling them. \nAppendix J of the Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan describes the locations \nwhere these issues are causing or potentially causing water quality problems. The six primary \nissues of concern are: \n \n• Sediments and turbid water, \n• Nutrient enrichment and algae growth, \n• Bacteria and other pathogens, \n• Invasive aquatic plant species,  \n• Pesticides (currently used herbicides and insecticides), and \n• Trash dumping and littering in and around the Reservoir and its shoreline. \n \nAvailable information was used to identify the sources of each pollutant. When sufficient \ndata were available, current pollutant loads were also estimated. With the pollutant sources \nclearly identified, the Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan identifies priority \nHUC12 watersheds in need of management measures. The Plan describes the method used to \nprioritize areas based on their relative risk for impacting the designated/desired uses of the \nReservoir and its tributaries, and highlights the priority areas determined from this process. The \nPlan recommends management practices for reducing the quantity of pollutants entering the \nReservoir and tributaries from priority watersheds. Practices include development of watershed \nimplementation plans and teams for priority areas, management measures for urban and rural \nareas, and additional regulatory controls in some situations. The Plan also identifies watersheds \n\nAppendix A  \nRezonate! Background and Planning Process October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nA-3 \nthat contain features that provide ecosystem services beneficial to the wellbeing of humans and \nthe environment. \nThe Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan includes specific \nrecommendations for voluntary pollutant management measures and a review of current \nenforceable mechanisms to reduce nonpoint source pollutants. Improved stormwater \nmanagement in urban areas near the Reservoir is an important component of this. Cost estimates \nand funding sources for these activities are included. A companion Water Quality Monitoring \nPlan will present a detailed plan to monitor the condition of the Reservoir and its watershed and \ndocument success as management measures are implemented. Finally, the Plan includes an \nimplementation schedule and criteria to be used to evaluate the success of the management \nmeasures as they are implemented. \nThe Pathogen Source Assessment and Wastewater Management Plan focuses on \nsources of pathogens within watersheds directly adjacent to the Reservoir and proposes a \ndetailed plan for improving wastewater infrastructure in this area. \nThe Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for Rezonate! includes a detailed \nplan for engaging targeted audiences in the protection of the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. \nThe Source Water Protection Plan for the O.B. Curtis Drinking Water Intake will \nguide and shape policy to protect the drinking water source for the City of Jackson. It identifies \nthe required actions for mitigating the identified threats, both existing and future, to the source \nwater along with new and existing programs, projects, and resources, and emergency response \nprotocols. \n \nWho\tparticipated\tin\tthe\tplanning\tprocess?\t\nMDEQ contracted with FTN Associates, Ltd. (FTN) to provide project management and \ntechnical support needed to develop the Rezonate Plans. An additional contractor, CDM Inc. \n(CDM), was responsible for development of the Pathogen Source Assessment and Wastewater \nManagement Plan. FTN and CDM coordinated work groups of local stakeholders and agency \nrepresentatives to give input into all aspects of the planning process. Work groups developed for \neach of the Plans are described below. FTN also worked with The Cirlot Agency to develop the \n\nAppendix A  \nRezonate! Background and Planning Process October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nA-4 \nComprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for Rezonate! and materials needed for the \npublic outreach campaign. The Cirlot Agency coordinated WaterFest 2010, an annual family \nevent held at the Reservoir to educate citizens about protecting water quality in the Reservoir. \nWaterFest will be held each spring using the planning guidance assembled by The Cirlot \nAgency. \n \nSteering\tTeam\t\nThe Steering Team is composed of local leaders and representatives of resource agencies \nthat have direct responsibility for activities effecting water quality in the watershed. Several \nmembers are leaders of organizations involved in economic development activities in central \nMississippi. Members of the team represent the five counties that are nearest to the Reservoir: \nHinds, Leake, Madison, Rankin, and Scott. \nPrior to forming the steering team, MDEQ recognized that stakeholder input and \ninvolvement are essential for success of the watershed plans. The steering team was envisioned \nas a method to direct efforts to reach stakeholders who live and work in the watershed, and have \nan interest in participating in the restoration and protection of this resource. Steering Team \nmembers and the agencies or groups they represent are listed in Table A.1. Steering Team \nmembers met twice during the initial planning process and had the opportunity to review and \nprovide input into draft plans as they were developed. \nRoles and responsibilities of the Steering Team are as follows: \n \n1. Participate in quarterly Steering Team Meetings. \n2. Provide oversight and review for all aspects of the project, especially the \nfollowing: \n \n• Water Quality Monitoring Plan, \n• Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan, \n• Source Water Protection Plan for the O.B. Curtis Drinking Water Intake, \n• Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for Rezonate!, \n• Building Local Stakeholder Capacity, and \n• Quality Assurance Plans. \n\nAppendix A  \nRezonate! Background and Planning Process October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nA-5 \n3. Assist with collaboration and leveraging opportunities (related to individuals, \nagencies, expertise, and funding). \n4. Serve, or identify others to participate, in technical work groups and \neducation/outreach work groups, as appropriate. \n5.

The team met on a regular basis (monthly or more often) \nduring the development of this Plan and other plans being developed for the Initiative. \n \nTechnical\tAdvisory\tGroup\t\nThe technical advisory group met on several occasions to assist in the development of the \nComprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan. The group provided input and guidance into \nthe technical aspects of the Plan, pollutant causes and sources, prioritization of subwatersheds, \nand appropriate management measures. Drafts of completed sections of the plan were reviewed \nand modified according to input from the advisory group. The roles/responsibilities of the \nTechnical Advisory Group included: \n \n• Provide review and oversight for the Watershed Protection and Restoration Plan \nand the Source Water Protection Plan, \n• Ensure plans are technically sound and feasible, \n• Identify participants and other resources for implementation of the plans, \n• Recommend and review members and agendas for technical work group \nmeetings, and \n• Attend meetings as needed.  \n \nMembers of the Technical Advisory Group are listed in Table A.2. \n \nWater\tQuality\tMonitoring\tWork\tGroup\t\nThe water quality monitoring work group met on a routine basis beginning in the fall \nof 2009 and ending in the fall of 2010. The work group assisted with assembling a \ncomprehensive inventory of water quality data available for the Ross Barnett Reservoir \nwatershed. The group provided recommendations for elements of the water quality monitoring \nplan. Several versions of the plan were reviewed by the group and revised based on work group \ninput.

B-42 \n \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-1 \nHistory \nAfter many years of planning, construction of the Ross Barnett Reservoir began in 1960 \nand was completed in 1965. The Reservoir was first filled to normal pool elevation in \nJanuary 1965. The Pearl River Valley Water Supply District (PRVWSD) is the state agency \ncreated to construct and manage the Reservoir. PRVWSD is self-supporting and receives no \nfunds from state or local taxes. \nConstruction of the Reservoir was financed by the City of Jackson and the five member \ncounties: Hinds, Leake, Madison, Rankin, and Scott. The bonds for the construction of the \nReservoir were completely retired in 1992. An agreement between the City of Jackson and \nPRVWSD allows the City to withdraw water from the Ross Barnett Reservoir at no additional \ncharge to the City. \n \nPhysiographic Regions \nRoss Barnett Reservoir and its watershed are located in the North Central Hills and \nJackson Prairie physiographic regions (MARIS online mapping accessed November 2009) of the \nGulf Coastal Plain physiographic province of North America (NRCS 2009), shown on \nFigure B.1. The North Central Hills region, in which the majority of the watershed is located, is \nan area of high relief, with moderate to steep slopes interspersed with flatter, more rolling hills \n(NRCS 1999, 2009). The southeastern watershed, around Pelahatchie River, is located in the \nJackson Prairie region. This region is characterized by gently rolling hills with slight to moderate \nslopes (NRCS 1999, 2009; SCS 1987). \nOverall, approximately 11% of the watershed is classified as having moderate to steep \nslopes. Figure B.2 shows the locations of different slope classes in the watershed. The larger \nrivers in the watershed (i.e., Pearl River, Yockanookany River, Lobutcha Creek, and \nTuscolameta Creek) have formed broad valleys with floodplains and local terrace deposits \n(NRCS 1999). \n\n \n \n \nB-2 \nFigure B.1. Physiographic regions present \nin Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nB-3 \nFigure B.2. Classification of\n slope in the Ross Barn\nett Reservoir watershed. \n \n \n \n \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-4 \nEcoregions and Bioregions \nThe Ross Barnett watershed includes portions of three Level IV ecoregions, shown on \nFigure B.3 (Chapman et al. 2004). The Loess Plains and the Jackson Prairie ecoregions are \nclosest to the Reservoir. Upstream of the Reservoir, the majority of the watershed is located in \nthe Southern Hilly Gulf Coastal Plain ecoregion. The Loess Plains ecoregion is characterized by \na gently rolling landscape underlain by a relatively thin layer of loess. Streams and rivers in this \necoregion tend to be low gradient with silty and sandy substrate. The Jackson Prairie ecoregion is \ncharacterized by irregular plains and low, broad hills. Historic vegetation in this ecoregion was \nmostly mixed pine and hardwood forest, with prairies interspersed. This area has experienced \nextensive soil erosion resulting from historical land management. The Southern Hilly Gulf \nCoastal Plain ecoregion is characterized by dissected irregular plains and gently rolling low hills. \nNatural vegetation in the portion of this ecoregion where the Ross Barnett watershed is located is \nmostly oak-hickory-pine forest (Chapman et al. 2004). \nAs part of the development of the Mississippi Benthic Index of Stream Quality (MBISQ), \nthe state was divided into five bioregions – regions of similar landscape characteristics and \nstream benthos. Different biological metrics are used to calculate the MBISQ score in each \nbioregion. The Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed straddles the boundary between the East and \nWest Bioregions (Figure B.4). The majority of the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed is within \nthe East Bioregion, which includes the Southern Hilly Gulf Coastal Plain and Jackson Prairie \necoregions. Portions of the watershed, including the Reservoir itself, are located in the Loess \nPlains ecoregion and the West Bioregion. \n \n\n \n \n \nB-5 \nFigure B.3.

Average annual temperature range at Jackson, Mississippi. \nClimate \nIn general, Mississippi has mild winters and long hot summers, with high humidity \nbetween May and September\n1\n. According to the Mississippi State Climatologist, winter average \ndaily temperatures in central Mississippi typically are in the low- to mid-40s (°F). Summer \naverage daily temperatures in this area are typically in the 80s, with daily maximums over 90°F. \nFigure B.5 shows the average annual temperature range for Jackson. Average annual \nprecipitation in the watershed is typically around 55 inches. Monthly precipitation averages \nrange from a little over 3 inches to over 5 inches, with September typically being the driest \nmonth, and the highest rainfalls occurring during the winter and early spring. Figure B.6 shows \nmonthly average precipitation at Jackson. First frost typically occurs in November, and last frost \nin March.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n1\n http://geosciences.msstate.edu/stateclimatologist.htm \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-8 \nFigure B.6.

All underlying geologic outcrops in the watershed are of the Eocene period \n(Thompson 2009). A general map of the geology within the Ross Barnett watershed is shown on \nFigure B.7. \n \nGeologic Faults \nThe watershed crosses the Pickens-Gilbertown fault systems and the Phillips fault \nsystem. It also crosses the Central Mississippi ridge and the Mississippi deformed belt \n(Figure B.8). The upper watershed is underlain by the buried Appalachian tectonic belt \n(Thompson 2009). \n \n\n \n \n \nB-9 \nFigure B.7. Geology underlying Ross Barn\nett Reservoir and its watershed. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nB-10 \nFigure B.8. Geologic structure features with\nin the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. \n \n \n \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-11 \nResource Extraction \nThere are a number of carbon dioxide wells in the watershed in Rankin and Madison \ncounties\n2\n. There has been recent activity to extract carbon dioxide deposits from the Jackson \nDome, which is partially located under the Reservoir. There are several oil wells in the \nwatershed in Rankin County\n3\n. Sand and gravel mining activities currently take place in Rankin, \nMadison, Attala, Leake, and Neshoba counties. Clay mining is conducted in Winston County\n4\n. \n \nSoils \nSoil texture is determined by the relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay in the soil. \nNRCS defines sand, silt, and clay based on particle size, in which sand is the largest and clay the \nsmallest size. Loam is a mixture of all three particle sizes\n5\n. Soils in the watershed are primarily \nfine-grained. In the upper watershed, fine sandy loams predominate, with silt loams and loams \noccurring in the large river valleys, and patches of loamy sand in Leake and Neshoba counties \nnear Lobutcha Creek and Beasha Creek. In the lower watershed and the Reservoir, silt loams \npredominate, with silty clays and silty clay loams in the major river valleys, and patches of loam, \nand silty clay loam, and fine sandy loams in the tributary headwaters (Figure B.9). \nHydric soils occur in the watershed along drainageways, in floodplains and depressions\n6\n. \nNRCS defines hydric soils as soils that are sufficiently wet in the upper part to develop anaerobic \nconditions during the growing season\n7\n. Hydric soils are shown on Figure B.10. \n \n                                                \n \n2\n http://gis.ogb.state.ms.us/MSOGBOnline/ \n3\n Ibid. \n4\n http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/state/2003/msstmyb03.pdf \n5\n https://www.soils.org/publications/soils-glossary \n6\n http://soils.usda.gov/use/hydric/lists/state.html \n7\n http://soils.usda.gov/use/hydric/overview.html \n\n \n \n \nB-12 \nFigure B.9.

Hydric soils in the \nRoss Barnett Reservoi\n\nr watershed. \n \n \n \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-14 \nInformation to describe soil erodibility is available in the state Soil Survey Geographic \n(SSURGO) database for all the counties included in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. The \nSSURGO database defines soils as “highly erodible land” or “not highly erodible land.” Areas \nwhere erosivity cannot be clearly defined are described as “potentially highly erodible land.” The \ndefinition of highly erodible land is based upon the specific variables of the Universal Soil Loss \nEquation (USLE) (Wischmeier and Smith 1978). The USLE represents the tons of soil loss by \nerosion predicted for bare ground divided by the sustainable soil loss (USDA 2000). The overall \nrating is based on an evaluation of the water erosion hazard and USLE values. If all values in an \narea are either highly erodible or not highly erodible, then that value is assigned. When values in \nan area are not consistent, a value of potentially highly erodible is assigned (USDA 1995) \n(Figure B.11).  \n \nLand Use Trends and History \nThe National Agriculture Statistics Service\n8\n collects agriculture land use data on a county \nbasis. Data for Scott, Hinds, Rankin, Leake, and Madison counties were reviewed for the period \nfrom 1928 to 2008. The data provided by the NASS website included acreage of individual crops \nplanted on a county basis. Data showed that these five counties exhibit similar yearly trends of \ntotal crop acreage and percent crop acreage (defined as crop acreage/total county land acreage). \nWhile total crop acreage and percent crop acreage amounts vary between counties, the trends \nremain relatively consistent as a function of time. In all five counties, the percentage of the \ncounty in cropland peaked in the early 1980s and then sharply declined. Maximum percentages \nof cropland in the early 1980s ranged from 7% to 26% (Figure B.12). \n                                                \n \n8\n www.nass.usda.gov \n\n \n \n \nB-15 \nFigure B.11.

The drainage \narea/surface area ratio value of 61 is relatively high and indicates that BMPs installed closer to \nthe Reservoir will likely have a greater impact on water quality than practices installed in the \nupper parts of the watershed. The aspect ratio is also relatively high at 38.2. As a rule-of-thumb, \nan aspect ratio greater than 4 indicates that longitudinal gradients are more important than lateral \ngradients in water quality. The shoreline development ratio value of 4.3 indicates that the Ross \nBarnett Reservoir contains a limited number of coves and near-shoreline areas for nursery and \nspawning of fish. A shoreline development ratio of 1 indicates a perfect circle with very little \nshoreline area, while a value of 15 indicates a highly dendritic shoreline. The mean depth to \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-17 \nmaximum depth ratio value for the Reservoir of 0.2 indicates very shallow side slopes with \nextensive littoral area. A relative depth value of less than 1 indicates greater potential for wind \ndisruption of stratification. The Reservoir shows a very high potential for wind mixing that could \ncause resuspension of suspended sediment. The areal erosion is an estimate of the percent of lake \nbed that could be subject to erosion, impacting water quality. This value is relatively high for the \nReservoir. \n \nTable B.1.

The spillway is approximately 400 ft wide and is controlled by ten gates that are 21 ft \ntall and 40 ft wide. \nThe intake for the O.B. Curtis drinking water treatment plant is located on the Reservoir \nDam just west of the Madison/Rankin county line. The facility is owned and operated by the City \nof Jackson. The O.B. Curtis Plant, along with an additional drinking water treatment plant, \nJ.H. Fewel, currently provides water to 175,710 people through 71,788 connections in the city of \nJackson. The J.H. Fewel Plant is located on the Pearl River downstream of the Reservoir Dam. \nAfter a recent expansion, the O.B. Curtis facility has the capacity to treat 50 MGD of water; \nhowever, it presently treats an average of 20 MGD with a peak flow of 35 MGD. The intake \nstructure of the Reservoir allows the city to change the level of withdrawal due to water quality \nconditions in the Reservoir, primarily to avoid high concentrations of algae and manganese. \nHowever, the city does not routinely vary the intake depth (personal communication, Don Bach, \nCity of Jackson). The O.B. Curtis drinking water intake currently operates under Permit \nNo. MS-SW-024419 to divert or withdraw for beneficial use the public waters. \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-18 \nRoss Barnett Reservoir is essentially a flow-through reservoir, with limited flood storage \ncapacity. Reservoir water level is typically maintained between 296 ft msl (winter pool) and \n297.5 ft msl (summer pool). Average release flow based on spillway logs from PRVWSD \nbetween 1965 and 2005 was 3,718 cfs. PRVWSD has an agreement with the City of Jackson to \nmaintain a minimum flow of 112 MGD in the Pearl River downstream of the Reservoir based on \na contract between the City of Jackson and PRVWSD dated November 18, 1959, and a permit by \nthe State of Mississippi Board of Water Commissioners dated December 11, 1959.  \nBased on flow records from USGS gages at Yockanookany River at Ofahoma, and the \nPearl River at Lena, highest inflows to the Reservoir generally occur late December through \nApril, and lowest flows generally occur July through October. Reservoir releases are typically \ngreatest from December through April, and lowest in August. \nThe flood of record at the Reservoir occurred in April 1979, and resulted in an estimated \npeak inflow of approximately 160,000 cfs, and peak release of approximately 130,000 cfs \n(PRVWSD, no date). Flood stage on the Pearl River at Ratliff’s Ferry is reported to occur at an \nelevation of 303.0 ft. This established flood stage elevation can be considered to correspond to a \npeak flow of approximately 35,000 cfs. NOAA’s reported flow exceedance forecast indicates the \npeak flow of 35,000 cfs has a recurrence interval between the 2-year and 10-year flood events. \nThe Rankin County, Mississippi, Flood Insurance Study (FIS) reports the peak flow for the \n10-year flood event on Pelahatchie Creek at State Route 471 as approximately 17,900 cfs \n(FEMA 2003). The watershed is also subject to flash floods\n9\n. \nAccording to the National Climatic Data Center, between 1950 and 2009, drought events \noccurred in the watershed only during December 2006 and late spring through early summer \nof 2007. \n \nMajor Tributaries \nTable B.2 lists the drainage areas of major tributaries to Ross Barnett Reservoir and Pearl \nRiver, along with the percentage of the Ross Barnett watershed. They are shown on Figure B.13. \n \n                                                \n \n9\n http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwEvent~storms, accessed January 2010. \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-19 \nTable B.2.

The largest wetland system associated with the Reservoir is located in \nthe Pearl River State Wildlife Management Area along the northwest shore. Additional shoreline \nwetland systems are located on the eastern shore, just south of Highway 43, parts of the north \nshore of Pelahatchie Bay, and at the inflow of Pelahatchie Creek. \n \nAquifers \nAquifer(s) in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed are part of the Mississippi \nembayment aquifer system\n10\n. The watershed is underlain by five of the principal aquifers in \nMississippi: Cockfield, Sparta Sand, Winona-Tallahatta, Meridian-Upper Wilcox, and Lower \nWilcox (Wasson 1986, MDEQ 2009). Drinking water in the upper part of the watershed is \npumped from groundwater sources.  \n \n                                                \n \n10\n http://www.nationalatlas.gov \n\n \n \n \nB-20 \nFigure B.13.

Curtis drinking water treatment plant, which withdraws \nwater from the Ross Barnett Reservoir, has been recently expanded by the installation of a \nZeeWeed ultrafiltration system. This type of system was selected for installation based on \ntreatability studies.  \nDrinking water for the other communities in the watershed is supplied by groundwater. \nIn 2009 there were approximately 240 permitted public water supply wells in the watershed\n11\n. \n \nNatural Resources \nThe Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed contains an abundance of natural resources. These \nresources are protected through national forests, state parks, and wildlife refuges. Portions of the \nBienville National Forest and the Tombigbee National Forest are located within the watershed. \nNational forest lands are managed by the USDA Forest Service. \nSeveral state parks are located within the watershed. These include Golden Memorial \nState Park in Leake County, Roosevelt State Park in Morton, and Legion State Park in \nLouisville. State parks are managed by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and \nParks (MDWFP). \nWildlife refuges located in the watershed include the Pearl River Wildlife Management \nArea and Waterfowl Refuge, the Bienville Wildlife Management Area, and the Nanih Waiya \nWildlife Management Area. Wildlife refuges are also managed by MDWFP. \n \nSpecies of Concern \nThere are approximately 36 Mississippi animal species of concern, and 66 Mississippi \nplant species of concern identified as occurring in the counties within the Ross Barnett Reservoir \n                                                \n \n11\n http://www.deq.state.ms.us  \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-23 \nwatershed by the Mississippi Heritage Program\n12\n.

Species of greatest conservation \nneed associated with streams in this watershed are listed in Table B.5. The strategy identifies \napproximately 18 conservation activities for the streams in the Ross Barnett Reservoir \nwatershed. The strategy also identifies species of greatest conservation need, and recommended \nconservation activities for all of the land and water habitats that occur in the watershed.  \nEach species is assigned a tier based on the level of concern. Tier 1 species are in need of \nimmediate conservation action and/or research because of extreme rarity, restricted distribution, \nunknown or decreasing population trends, specialized habitat needs and/or habitat vulnerability. \nSome species may be considered critically imperiled and at risk of extinction/extirpation. Tier 2 \nspecies are in need of timely conservation action and/or research because of rarity, restricted \ndistribution, unknown or decreasing population trend, specialized habitat needs, or habitat \nvulnerability or significant threats. Tier 3 species are of less immediate conservation concern, but \nare in need of planning and effective management due to unknown or decreasing population \ntrends, specialized habitat needs, or habitat vulnerability. \n \nTable B.5.

Clupeids (shad) are the dominant fish \nspecies present. Crappie and black bass anglers are the first and second most numerous angling \ngroups, respectively. In February 2009, the 15-inch minimum size limit on black bass was \nreduced to a 12-inch minimum length limit. The daily creel limit remained at seven fish. \nStatewide creel limits apply to other game fish. Commercial fishing is closed, but sport anglers \ntarget catfish with trotlines, jugs and handgrabbing (Bull 2009). \n \nSocioeconomics \nJackson MSA \nThe Ross Barnett Reservoir, and portions of its watershed, are located within the Jackson \nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which encompasses Madison, Rankin, Copiah, Hinds, and \nSimpson counties\n13\n. The MSA population in 2000 was 497,197. The July 1, 2008, population \nestimate for this MSA was 537,285 – an increase of 8%. Approximately two thirds of this \nincrease was due to local births, and one third was the result of in-migration\n14\n. In 2000, the racial \nmakeup of the MSA was primarily white (53.0%) and black (45.3%). The 3-year community \nsurvey for 2006 through 2008 indicated that the majority of the population was white (50.1%) or \nblack (46.5%), and that approximately 18% of the population was living on income below the \npoverty level\n15\n. \n \nCounty Population Estimates \nThe area around Ross Barnett Reservoir is relatively heavily populated (Table B.6). The \npopulation estimate from the 2009 census for Madison County is 130 people per square mile. For \nRankin County, the 2009 population estimate is 185 people per square mile.

According to the US Census \nBureau, the populations in Madison and Rankin counties have increased 24% since 2000\n16\n.  \nThe area upstream of the Reservoir is less densely populated (Table B.6). Figure B.15 \nshows the population data for 2000. Population data from 2009 were compared to 2000 data to \nreview recent changes. The 2009 population estimates for the upstream counties range from \n13 to 53 people per square mile. Five of the upstream counties (Scott, Leake, Newton, Neshoba, \nand Attala) experienced an increase in population since the 2000 Census (0.5% to 10.4%)\n17\n. \n \nTable B.6.

Contaminants of \nconcern for the advisories are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury. Mercury is the \ncontaminant of concern for Yockanookany River, and Pearl River upstream of Highway 25 \n(MDEQ 2004a). PCBs are the contaminants of concern for Little Conehoma Creek and \nYockanookany River from US Highway 35 to the Pearl River (Figure B.16). \nThe PCBs in fish in Little Conehoma Creek and the Yockanookany River came from a \nTexas Eastern Pipeline Compressor Station located near Kosciusko. During the time that PCBs \nwere in use at the compressor station (use of PCBs at this compressor station was discontinued \nin 1979), waste oil containing PCBs was disposed of in onsite pits. PCBs migrated from these \ndisposal pits to Conehoma Creek and the Yockanookany River. Texas Eastern entered into a \nconsent order with EPA in 1994, and as of 1997, the site was remediated. Fish tissue sampling \nin 1987 resulted in a fish consumption advisory being issued for Conehoma Creek and the \nYockanookany River and the 303(d) listing of these waterbodies. Fish tissues in these stream \nsegments were sampled again in 2003. The 2003 fish tissue data indicate the fish consumption \nadvisory should remain in effect; however, the concentrations of PCBs in the fish tissue have \ndecreased (MDEQ 2004b). \nThe primary source of mercury to the Yockanookany River and Pearl River is believed to \nbe atmospheric deposition of mercury emitted from regional and global sources. MDEQ has \nissued a moratorium on additional NPDES-permitted point source discharges containing mercury \nto the Yockanookany River and Pearl River. \n\n \n \n \nB-33 \nFigure B.16. Fish consumption advisories activ\ne in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAppendix B  \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Watershed Characteristics October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nB-34 \nHydrologic Unit Codes \nThe US Geological Survey (USGS) delineates watersheds into smaller areas commonly \nknown as 12-digit hydrologic unit codes (HUC12s). There are 87 HUC12s located within the \nReservoir watershed. HUC12 boundaries are an important consideration in determining priority \nwatersheds and targeting management practices because they define smaller-sized catchments at \na scale on which implementation can be most efficiently managed. The boundary lines for each \nHUC12 are shown on Figure B.17. The description, identification number, and area of each \nHUC12 are listed in Table B.10. The plans developed under the Ross Barnett Reservoir Initiative \nencompass the entire drainage area of the Reservoir, an area of approximately 3,050 square \nmiles. The HUC12s were divided into three major subwatershed groups based on proximity to \nthe Reservoir. The major subwatershed delineations are also shown on Figure B.17. The groups \nwere defined as the area approximately 10 times as large as the size of the Reservoir surface area \n(1x:10x), the area between 10 and 50 times as large as the reservoir surface area (10x:50x), and \nthe area above the 50x boundary (above 50x). \nProximity to the Reservoir was considered in determining the potential for pollutants \noriginating in the watershed reaching the Reservoir through tributary and overland flow inputs. \nAreas closer to the Reservoir have increased likelihood of contributing pollutants, whereas \npollutants originating from areas located at greater distances from the Reservoir may be removed \nby biological transformation processes or settling. Thus, focusing resources on areas closer to the \nReservoir in the initial phases of implementation of this plan was a reasonable approach for \noptimizing the cost-benefits of water quality improvements achieved from implementation of \nmanagement practices. \nMajor sub-watershed delineations were based on a ratio of the Reservoir surface area \nrelative to the size of the Reservoir drainage area. Three areas were delineated for surface \narea/drainage area ratios of 1x:10x, 10x:50x, and above 50x the surface area. Boundary lines \nwere drawn based on existing HUC12s within the Reservoir’s watershed.  \n \n\n \n \n \nB-35 \nFigure B.17.

The watershed area that is approximately 10 times larger than the Reservoir’s \nsurface area (1x:10x subwatershed), \n2. The watershed area outside of the 1x:10x area extending to an area approximately \n50 times larger than the Reservoir’s surface area (10x:50x subwatershed), and \n3. The watershed area above the 50x boundary (above 50x subwatershed). \n \n1x:10x Subwatershed \nThe 1x:10x subwatershed includes areas within Madison, Rankin, Scott, and Leake \ncounties. The area includes portions of the cities of Madison, Ridgeland, Flowood, Pelahatchie, \nand Morton and the town of Langford (Figure B.18). Forest/woodland is the dominant land use, \nfollowed by pasture/grassland (Table B.11). Developed areas are found primarily around \nPelahatchie Bay, on some parts of the shoreline areas in Madison and Rankin counties, and near \nthe Reservoir dam. Row-crop agriculture makes up only 4% of the land use in the 1x:10x \nsubwatershed and less than 1% of the remainder of the Reservoir drainage area. The majority of \nthe row-crop farming in the watershed occurs in the northeastern portion of Rankin County and \nwestern Scott County.

Major roads include parts of \nInterstate 20 and Highway 25, and the Natchez Trace. The area also contains parts of Bienville \nNational Forest.  \nThe 1x:10x watershed includes 17 HUC12s (Table B.10).

However, the effects of pollutant pressures originating from this \narea may be reduced due to the travel time and distance from the Reservoir. The land area in the \n1x:50x subwatershed is dominated by forest land use (which covers approximately 53% of the \nsubwatershed) and pasture/grassland (which covers 19% of the subwatershed) (Table B.12).  \nMajor tributaries of the Pearl River within the 10x:50x watershed include Tuscolameta \nCreek, Lobutcha Creek, and the upper portion of the Yockanookany River. Smaller tributaries \ninclude Standing Pine Creek, Noxapater Creek, Bogue Chitto, and Pinishook Creek. Counties \ninclude Scott, Newton, Leake, Neshoba, Kemper, Choctaw, Winston, and Attala. The cities of \nForest, Philadelphia, Carthage, Kosciusko, Ackerman, and Ethel are located in this \nsubwatershed. Major roads are Natchez Trace, Highway 12, Interstate 20, Highway 43, \nHighway 482, and Highway 16. Parts of the Choctaw Indian reservation are also contained in \nthis subwatershed. \n\n \n \n \nB-42 \nFigure B.19.

\n \n\nAppendix C  \nTributary Water Quality Analysis October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n1-1 \n1.0 INTRODUCTION \n \nAvailable monitoring data were analyzed to evaluate loading of total phosphorus (TP), \ntotal nitrogen (TN), and total suspended solids (TSS) into the Ross Barnett Reservoir. Available \ndata from the majority of the Reservoir tributary sites typically included flows and water \nchemistry from a single sample, or did not include flows at all. This analysis used only data sets \ncontaining flows and TP, TN, or TSS for multiple samples. Reasonably complete water quality \ndata sets were available from the Edinburg station on the Pearl River and the Revive station on \nthe Yockanookany River (Figure 1.1). The analysis focuses on these two stations. Flow \nmeasurements were also available for the Edinburg station on the Pearl River, but not at the \nRevive station on the Yockanookany River. For the analyses, Yockanookany River flow \nmeasurements collected just downstream of Revive, at Ofahoma, were used with the water \nquality data from Revive. \nThese data sets included water quality data from the US Environmental Protection \nAgency’s (EPA) Legacy STORET database, the Mississippi Department of Environmental \nQuality’s (MDEQ) Ambient Monitoring Program, MDEQ’s WADES database, and the US \nGeological Survey (USGS) flow gages. These data sources and periods of record (PORs) are \nsummarized in Table 1.1. Except for flow data, sampling during the time periods indicated in \nTable 1.1 were either monthly or bimonthly. \n \nTable 1.1.

Temporal variation in TP, TN and TSS concentrations and loads: \na. Annual, \nb. Wet versus dry season, and \nc. Wet versus dry years. \n \n2. Loading differences among watersheds; and \n3. Covariation among flow and TN, TP, and TSS. \n \nThis summary also discusses additional sampling data collected in the Pearl River and \nPelahatchie Creek. There is not a sufficient record of data at these sites to conduct a meaningful \nanalysis of temporal variation or covariation. A complete inventory of water quality monitoring \ndata collected in the Reservoir watershed is available in the Comprehensive Water Quality \nMonitoring Plan. \n \n \n \n\nAppendix C  \nTributary Water Quality Analysis October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n2-1 \n2.0 DATA ANALYSES \n \nTo calculate daily loads for each sampling date, the parameter concentration obtained \nfrom grab samples was multiplied by the total discharge on the sampling day, with appropriate \nunit conversions. Flow data were available as daily mean flows. No formal statistical analyses \nwere performed beyond simple linear regressions.

Interquartile TN loading values \ndiffered by over a factor of ten (190 versus 2,690 kg/day; Table 3.2). TN loading was strongly \nrelated to flow (Figure 3.5), with the greatest increase in loading occurring at approximately \n1,000 cfs, which is the 67\nth\n percentile among all daily flows from 1963 through 2009.  \n \n3.3.3   TSS   Concentrations   and Loadings Versus Flow \nScatter plots of TSS concentrations versus sampling date and flows are provided on \nFigure 3.6. TSS concentrations varied by over an order of magnitude among samples. \nInterquartile TSS concentrations differed by roughly a factor of 3 (5.0 versus 12.5 mg/L; \nTable 3.2). Examination of Figure 3.6 (top figure) suggests an overall decrease in TSS \nconcentrations between the years of 1962 through 1977 and the years of 1993 through 2001. \nBecause TSS concentrations are correlated with flow (Table 3.4), differences between TSS \nconcentrations in the 1962 through 1977 data set were compared with concentrations from the \nlater data set (1993 through 2001) by examining flow versus TSS for the two time periods \n(Figure 3.6, bottom figure). Examination of Figure 3.6 indicates a clear difference in TSS \nconcentrations between the two time periods, with the highest concentrations occurring during \n1962 through 1977. The regression lines indicate that the greatest average difference (about \none order of magnitude) is at the lower flows, while the two time periods differ by approximately \na factor of two at higher flows. \nExamination of Figure 3.6 shows that TSS concentrations of individual samples are \nsomewhat correlated with flows. However, the correlation is not nearly as strong as when the \ndata are combined into categories (e.g., base, intermediate, and high flows in Table 3.4). \n\n \n \n \n3-8 \nFigure 3.4.

Interquartile TSS loading \nvalues differed by nearly a factor of 30 (1,090 versus 32,000 kg/day; Table 3.2). The same \ndifferences between the 1962 through 1977 and 1993 through 2001 time periods were apparent, \nwith higher loading values and a steeper increase with flow apparent in the 1962 through 1977 \ndata set. In the 1993 through 2001 data set, the greatest increase in loading occurs at \napproximately 2,000 cfs, which is the 82\nnd\n percentile among all daily flows from 1963 \nthrough 2009.  \n \n3.4 Correlations Among Variables \nScatter plots of TN versus TSS, TP versus TSS, and TP versus TN are provided on \nFigure 3.8. The scatter plots show that, while the relationships are all in the expected direction \n(i.e., positive correlations among all three variables), the relationships are weak and of little \npredictive value. These weak relationships might suggest the following: \n \n1. Independent sources of TP, TN, and TSS; \n2. Variability in the relative proportions of nitrogen and phosphorus in suspended \nmatter; or \n3. A significant and variable inorganic component in the TSS. \n \n3.5 Seasonal and Wet Versus Dry Year Comparisons \nData were classified according to season and wet versus dry hydrological years based on \nflow records for the Yockanookany River and the Pearl River, as well as precipitation records for \nCarthage and Philadelphia. Based on these data, the years 1999, 2000, and 2007 were classified \nas dry and the years 1997 and 2003 were classified as wet. Based on available water quality data, \nonly a single wet year (1997) and a single dry year (2000) could be compared. This comparison \nis presented in Table 3.5 and indicates that, while average flows during the wet year (1997) were \n15 times higher than in the dry year (2000), concentrations of TN, TP and TSS were similar. \nDifferences in loading between years are therefore due to differences in flow. \n\n \n \n \n3-12 \n0.0E+00\n2.0E+06\n4.0E+06\n6.0E+06\n8.0E+06\n1.0E+07\n1.2E+07\n1.4E+07\n1.6E+07\n1.8E+07\n1101001,00010,000100,000\nCummulative\n \nTSS\n  \nLoading\n \n(kg/d)\nFlow (cfs)\n1962‐1977\n1993‐2001\n0.00E+00\n2.00E+05\n4.00E+05\n6.00E+05\n8.00E+05\n1.00E+06\n1.20E+06\n1.40E+06\nJun‐62 Nov‐67 May‐73 Nov‐78 Apr‐84 Oct‐89 Apr‐95 Oct‐00 Mar‐06\nTSS\n  \nLoading\n \n(Kg/d)\nSampling Date\nFigure 3.7.

The scatter plots show that the relationships are weak and of little predictive value. \nThis pattern is similar to that observed at the Pearl River station and might be due to the \nfollowing: \n \n1. Independent sources of TP, TN, and TSS; \n2. Variability in the relative proportions of nitrogen and phosphorus in suspended \nmatter; or \n3. A significant and variable inorganic component in the TSS. \n \n4.5 Seasonal and Wet Year Versus Dry Year Comparisons \nData were classified according to season and wet versus dry hydrological years based on \nflow precipitation records as described previously. Based on available water quality data only a \nsingle wet year (1997) and a single dry year (2000) could be compared. This comparison is \npresented in Table 4.5 and indicates that, while average flows during the wet year (1997) were \n42 times higher than in the dry year (2000), concentrations of TN, TP, and TSS were similar. \nDifferences in loading between years are therefore due to differences in flow. \n \nTable 4.5.

A direct comparison \nof loading is not valid because the watershed area of the Pearl River at Edinburg (578,767 acres) \nis twice as large as the watershed area of the Yockanookany River at Revive (274,502 acres) or \nOfahoma (300,160 acres). Therefore, under similar conditions, the Pearl River station should \nalways show about twice the loading. Accordingly, the data were scaled to reflect the yield of \nTP, TN, or TSS per unit area per sampling day. This variable plotted against flow provides an \nindication of the amount of TP, TN, or TSS that leaves a unit of the watershed at a given flow \nrate. The two watersheds can be compared in terms of their TP, TN, and TSS yield per unit area \nby comparing the slopes and y-intercepts of scatter plots of TP, TN, or TSS versus flow. These \nplots are provided on Figures 5.1 through 5.3. The slopes of the relationships are very similar \nacross all three parameters, indicating that the relationship between yield and flow is similar \nbetween the two watersheds. In all cases, the y-intercept of the Yockanookany River regression \nline is less than that of the Pearl River line, indicating that the Yockanookany River watershed \nyields less TP, TN, and TSS per unit area than the Pearl River watershed. This is also confirmed \nby visual examination of the fitted regression lines. However, the absolute differences between \nthe y-intercepts are very small and amount to only fractions of grams per acre. Therefore, \nalthough there are discernable differences between the watersheds, the differences are slight and \nwould not warrant greater attention to one watershed versus the other.  \n\n \n \n \n5-2 \nFigure 5.2.

EPA and MDEQ assisted the Mississippi Band of Choctaw \nIndians with a water quality study on the Pearl River from Burnside to Sunrise, Mississippi. The \nstudy was conducted in the summer of 2003 and was designed to assess the effects of several \npoint source discharges of treated wastewater on a section of the Pearl River. Facilities of \nconcern included the Town of Pearl River’s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and facilities \nserving Philadelphia and New Harmony.  \nResults of the study showed that water quality standards for dissolved oxygen were being \nmet in the tributaries (Beesha Creek and Kentawka Creek Canal) and in the portion of the Pearl \nRiver included in the study. However, nutrient levels (measured as TN and TP) were \nconsiderably higher than the expected background levels for this area based on USGS data. \nExpected levels based on median data for this area were 0.2 mg/L TN and 0.05 mg/L TP. \nMeasured levels were 0.59 mg/L TN and 0.07 mg/L TP. \nThis study noted that algae growth was likely limited by nitrogen based on algae growth \npotential tests. The point source dischargers may be the primary source of nutrients in this part of \nthe Pearl River. Measured concentrations of chlorophyll-a were lower than expected because \ndense canopy cover in the area limited the amount of light reaching the water surface and high \nturbidity limited algae growth by reducing light penetration into the water (EPA 2003). \n \n6.2      Pelahatchie      Creek      \nDuring 2004, MDEQ Field Services Division conducted a field investigation on \nPelahatchie Creek to study the impact of the Reservoir East wastewater discharge on Pelahatchie \nCreek. The study included water chemistry sampling at five stations on Pelahatchie Creek. \nSamples were analyzed for nutrients, organic material, and fecal coliform bacteria. Biological \nsampling was also conducted at several sites. Field data collected during this study are not \navailable from MDEQ at this time. \n\nAppendix C  \nTributary Water Quality Analysis October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n6-2 \nMDEQ uses macroinvertebrates (aquatic insects) to determine general stream conditions. \nBiological sampling has been conducted on wadeable sections of several tributaries of the Pearl \nRiver streams (Figure 6.1). Three stream segments in the immediate vicinity of the Reservoir \nhave been assessed and are considered poor. These are Fannegusha Creek, which enters the Pearl \nRiver at the north end of the main lake; Cane Creek, which enters the Reservoir; and an unnamed \ntributary to Pelahatchie Creek, which enters Pelahatchie Bay (MDEQ 2008). \n\nAppendix C  \nTributary Water Quality Analysis October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n6-3 \nFigure 6.1.

quality with special emphasis on total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and Secchi \ndisc transparency. Data analyzed were collected by several agencies including the Mississippi \nDepartment of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), the US Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA), the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH), \nand the City of Jackson. Data from five lake sampling locations (Figure 1.1) were available over \nvarious time periods (Table 1.1). Only surface samples (collected at a depth of one meter or less) \nwere used in the analysis. \nThe following aspects of Reservoir water quality were evaluated: \n \n1. Temporal variation: \na. Long-term trends, \nb. Seasonal: \ni. Spring, summer, winter, fall; and \nii. Wet season versus dry season. \n \nc. Wet versus dry hydrological years. \n \n2. Spatial variation (differences among stations), \n3. Covariation among nutrients and endpoints such as chlorophyll a and \ntransparency, \n4. Seasonal patterns in thermal stratification, and \n5. Distribution of fecal coliform bacteria levels. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n1-2 \n \n \n \nFigure 1.1.

Eutrophication in surface waters occurs when elevated levels of nutrients lead to changes \nin the aquatic ecosystem, resulting in increased primary production and decreased dissolved \noxygen levels. MDEQ classified the Ross Barnett Reservoir as “eutrophic” using the Carlson \nTrophic State Index based on Secchi depth. Trophic state is a scale that describes the condition \nof a waterbody based on its productivity. However, assessments of trophic state index do not \nreflect whether a waterbody supports its designated use. MDEQ noted that trophic state is not \nsynonymous with water quality. Although trophic state and use support status are related, they \nshould not be used interchangeably. MDEQ also noted that any conclusions drawn from the use \nof the Carlson Trophic State Index applied to Mississippi lakes should be used with caution, \nbecause the index was developed for lakes with little non-algal turbidity (MDEQ 2010). \n \n\nAppendix D  \nReservoir Water Quality Analysis October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n2-1 \n2.0 DATA ANALYSIS \n \n2.1 Preliminary Data Analysis and Data Classification \nTo evaluate factors affecting the variation and mean values of total nitrogen, total \nphosphorus, Secchi disc transparency, and chlorophyll a, the data were classified according to \nseason and wet versus dry hydrological years. Wet versus dry years were chosen according to \nflows records for Yockanookany River and Pearl River, and precipitation records for the cities of \nCarthage and Philadelphia. Based on these data, the years 1999, 2000, and 2007 were classified \nas dry years, and the years 1997 and 2003 were classified as wet years. \nFor the seasonal analysis, monitoring data were first classified as spring \n(March 21 through June 21), summer (June 22 through September 21), fall (September 22 \nthrough January 21) and winter (January 22 through March 20). This analysis showed only weak \ndifferences among seasons. This finding was not surprising, because strong seasonality should \nnot be expected at inland latitudes similar to the Reservoir’s latitude. Seasons at the Reservoir’s \nlatitude might be more accurately characterized as cool and wet (November through May) versus \nwarm and dry (June through October). Accordingly, the data were classified as wet season \n(November through May) and dry season (June through October). A statistical summary of all \ndata is presented in Table 2.1. \nA preliminary evaluation of data from the RBR-2 and Highway 43 locations showed that \nthere were few, if any, differences in total phosphorus, total nitrogen, Secchi disc transparency, \nand chlorophyll a between those stations. Accordingly, the values for those parameters from \nRBR-2 and Highway 43 were combined for the purposes of this analysis. \n \n \n\nAppendix D  \nReservoir Water Quality Analysis October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n2-2 \nTable 2.1.

This analysis was \nperformed to determine if any of the factors (i.e., hydrological years, seasons, stations) accounted \nfor a relatively large portion of the total variance. The analysis was performed only for total \nphosphorus, total nitrogen, and Secchi disc transparency. For all three analyses, there were no \nstatistically significant effects due to station, season or hydrological year (P > 0.2 in all tests). \nFurther analysis of the data involving simple visual evaluations of data plots (scatter plots, \nbox-and-whisker plots) was conducted. These evaluations revealed a number of patterns that \nmight be of management significance even though they are not statistically significant. \n \n2.2      Temporal      Variation      \n2.2.1   Differences Among Years \nThe approach to evaluate annual variation was to examine time-series plots for evidence \nof trends, cycles, or differences among years for stations with the most complete time-series data \nsets. Examination of Figures 2.1 and 2.2 indicates possible weak downward trends in Secchi disc \ntransparency from mid-2003 through July 2006 and in maximum chlorophyll a from 2003 \nthrough 2005. No similar inter-annual patterns were noted with total nitrogen and total \nphosphorus. \n \n2.2.2   Seasonal   Variation   \nSeasonal variation (growing season versus winter) is apparent in the time-series plot for \nchlorophyll a from RBR-2+Highway 43 (Figure 2.2). Wet and dry season comparisons are \nshown for total phosphorus, total nitrogen and Secchi disc transparency at RBR-1, \nRBR-2 + Hwy 43, RBR-3 and RBR-4 on Figures 2.3 through 2.6, respectively.

Wet season total phosphorus and \ntotal nitrogen should be higher and Secchi disc transparency lower than dry season values. This \nwas generally the case except at RBR-3, where dry season total phosphorus values ranged higher \nthan wet season values and wet season Secchi disc transparency was higher than dry season. \nAlso notable is the higher dry season Secchi disc transparency and chlorophyll a at \nRBR-2 + Hwy 43. This pattern suggests that higher primary productivity in the Reservoir occurs \nas the water become clearer and suggests that primary production in the Reservoir might be \nlight-limited. This possibility is discussed in further detail later in Sections 3.0 and 4.0. \nThere was little trend for more variability in total nitrogen, total phosphorus, or Secchi \ndisc transparency in upper versus lower reservoir locations as evidenced by spatial changes in the \ncoefficient of variation (CV) or interquartile range as percentage of the median (IQR%) \n(Table 2.1). \n \n2.2.1   Wet Versus Dry Hydrological Years \nComparisons of wet versus dry hydrological years for total phosphorus, total nitrogen, \nand Secchi disc transparency are presented on Figures 2.7 though 2.9, respectively. Although \ndifferences are not statistically significant, there appear to be consistent differences among \nstations in total phosphorus and Secchi disc transparency between wet and dry hydrological \nyears. Figure 2.8 shows a slight increase in total phosphorus at all stations in wet years compared \nto dry years, while Figure 2.9 shows a slight decrease in Secchi disc transparency at all stations. \nThese changes are consistent with expectations for these parameters. Total nitrogen showed \ndifferences between wet and dry years that were not consistent among stations (Figure 2.7). \n \n \n\n \n \n \n2-11 \nLeast Squares Means\nDryWe t\nHY D_SEASON$\n-1.00\n-0.25\n0.50\n1.25\n2.00\nTOTAL_N_MGL\nDam\nDryWe t\nHYD_SEASON$\n-1.00\n-0.25\n0.50\n1.25\n2.00\nTOTAL_N_MGL\nMid Lk\nDryWe t\nHY D  SEASON$\n-1.00\n-0.25\n0.50\n1.25\n2.00\nTOTAL_N_MG L\nUpper Lk\nFigure 2.7.

As \ndiscussed in Section 2.2.2, general differences were observed between wet and dry seasons; \ntherefore, station differences were examined separately for wet and dry seasons. Results of this \ncomparison are presented on Figures 2.10 through 2.12. Figures 2.10 and 2.11 indicate a general \npattern of increasing total phosphorus and total nitrogen from the dam station (RBR-1) to the \nupper reservoir (RBR-3). Total phosphorus and total nitrogen at the Pelahatchie Bay station \n(RBR-4) more closely resembled the upper reservoir station in the wet season, and the \nmid-reservoir station in the dry season. A similar spatial trend is evident with dry season Secchi \ndisc transparency (Figure 2.12). Wet season Secchi disc transparency departs somewhat from the \npattern with lower values at the Pelahatchie Bay station and similar values among the main \nreservoir stations (Figure 2.12). These gradients from lower to upper reservoir agree with \npatterns that are typically seen in reservoirs. \n \n2.4 Covariation Among Nutrients and Nutrient Response Parameters \nAdequate chlorophyll a data for this analysis were available only for the mid-reservoir \nlocation (RBR-2+Hwy 43). Scatter plots showing the relationships between chlorophyll a versus \nnutrients and Secchi disc transparency are provided on Figures 2.13 and 2.14. The scatter plots \nindicate weak relationships between nutrients and response parameters. Secchi disc transparency \nshows a weak (R\n2\n = 0.19) positive relationship with chlorophyll a, indicating a tendency for \nhigher chlorophyll a values in clearer water. Total phosphorus shows a weak (R\n2\n = 0.07) \nnegative relationship with chlorophyll a, indicating a tendency for higher chlorophyll a values at \nlower levels of total phosphorus. The total nitrogen versus chlorophyll a relationship is \nessentially flat. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n2-15 \n012345\nStation Number\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nTotal Nitrogen, mg/L\nDry\n012345\nStation Number\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nTotal Nitrogen, mg/L\nWet\nFigure 2.10.

In these systems, chlorophyll a will tend to show \na negative relationship with Secchi disc transparency to the extent that water clarity is controlled \nby algal biomass. As non-algal turbidity increases, an aquatic system will tend to become less \nnutrient-limited and more light-limited and the correlation between Secchi disc transparency and \nchlorophyll a decreases. The scatter plots presented on Figures 2.13 through 2.15 indicate that \nprimary production in the reservoir is typically light-limited. \n \n2.5 Thermal Stratification and Dissolved Oxygen \nFigure 2.16 provides temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles from the dam station \nduring the summer months of 2003 and 2004. The vertical temperature profiles indicate that the \nReservoir is typically only weakly stratified during much of the summer, with the strongest \nstratification possibly occurring during early to mid-summer. The July profiles for both years \nindicate that dissolved oxygen decreases to very low levels or to anoxia during periods of strong \nstratification. During these periods of anoxia, phosphorus is likely released from the sediments \nand subsequently transferred into the water column upon lake mixing.  \n\n \n \n \n2-20 \n-1.6\n-1.4\n-1.2\n-1\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.20.71.2\nDry  Season  LogTP\nDry Season LogTSS\nLinear fit (-1.094  \n+0.136x)\n95% CI\n95% Prediction \ninterval\n-1.6\n-1.4\n-1.2\n-1\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.61.11.62.1\nWet Season LogTP\nWet Season LogTSS\nLinear fit (-1.266  \n+0.2217x)\n95% CI\n95% Prediction \ninterval\nFigure 2.15.

Samples were collected during wet and dry seasons from 1997 through \nAugust 2001. A summary of the combined data from all sampling locations is provided in \nTable 2.2. The State of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal \nWaters (MDEQ 2007) states that: \n \n“For the months of May through October, when water contact recreation activities may \nbe expected to occur, fecal coliform shall not exceed a geometric mean of 200 per \n100 mL based on a minimum of 5 samples taken over a 30-day period with no less than \n12 hours between individual samples, nor shall the samples examined during a 30-day \nperiod exceed 400 per 100 mL more than 10% of the time.” \n \nIt was not practical, given the available data, to reproduce the MDEQ assessment method \nfor evaluating compliance with the state water quality criteria for fecal coliform bacteria. \nHowever, the summary presented in Table 2.2 indicates that the geometric mean of bacteria \ncounts is well below 200 colony-forming units (CFU) per 100 mL and that over 90% of dry \nseason values are less than 400 CFU per 100 mL. This analysis indicates that Ross Barnett \nReservoir is in general compliance with primary contact-based water quality criteria for fecal \ncoliform bacteria. \n\nAppendix D  \nReservoir Water Quality Analysis October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n2-23 \nTable 2.2.

In addition, as shown on Figure 2.12, it \ndoes not appear that total phosphorus is closely related to total suspended solids (TSS). This \nresult suggests that management efforts that reduce non-algal turbidity might not result in a \nconcomitant reduction in total phosphorus. Increased water clarity without a corresponding \ndecrease in total phosphorus might lead to extremely high levels of algal production and \nbiomass.  \nThe Reservoir appears to be thermally stratified for only a relatively short period of time \nin the early summer. During this time, the hypolimnion can become anoxic, which typically \nresults in nutrient release from the lake sediments. These nutrients can be then incorporated into \nthe water column upon destratification. In the case of the Ross Barnett Reservoir, this period of \ninternal loading would occur in the middle of the algal growing season. This could further \nincrease the potential for algal blooms. Internal loading due to mid-summer destratification \nmight also account for the poor correlation between total phosphorus and TSS. It could also \nrepresent a cause of early summer algal blooms that would not be affected by watershed-based \nmanagement activities.  \n\nAppendix D  \nReservoir Water Quality Analysis October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n4-1 \n4.0 CONCLUSIONS \n \n• The lack of strong seasonality in nutrient conditions suggests that wet weather \nevents might not strongly control potential primary production in the Reservoir. \n• Management of suspended solids in the Reservoir might not simultaneously \nreduce nutrient, thereby creating the potential for significant increases in algal \nproduction and biomass. \n• Internal loading as a result of mid-summer episodes of lake destratification might \nbe a significant source of nutrients to the Reservoir.  \n• The Ross Barnett Reservoir is in general compliance with the primary \ncontact-based water quality criteria for fecal coliform. \n \n\nAppendix D  \nReservoir Water Quality Analysis October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \n5-1 \n5.0 REFERENCES \n \nMDEQ. 2007.

These species are typically the top \npredators in aquatic systems and are most likely to show the highest concentrations of \nbioaccumulative pollutants (e.g., mercury and some pesticides), particularly with larger, older \nindividuals. These species are also important sport/game fish and are often highly sought by \nanglers. \nFour composite samples of three to four fish were analyzed for each species. Weights and \nlengths of fish included in each composite are summarized in Table E.1. Fish weights ranged \nfrom 1 lb to 1.6 lb for largemouth bass and 5.2 lb to 7.8 lb for flathead catfish. Samples were \nanalyzed for the analytes listed in Table E.2. Analysis of all metals except mercury followed US \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 200.7. Mercury analysis followed EPA \nMethod 245.1. Analysis of organic contaminants followed EPA Method 8081. \n \n2.0 RESULTS \n \nAnalytical results are summarized in Tables E.3, E.4 and E.5. No organic analytes, \nincluding toxaphene or DDT, were detected above their respective minimum quantitation levels \n(MQLs) (Table E.3). Metal concentrations, as indicated by the average and maximum \nconcentrations as well as the number of samples exceeding the MQL, were similar in both \nspecies (Table E.4). Of the metals detected in excess of the MQL, only arsenic and mercury have \nfish tissue-based warning limits associated with human health protection (Table E.4). Of these \ntwo, only mercury was detected in any of the eight samples (six of eight samples; three samples \neach for largemouth bass and flathead catfish).  \nResults of mercury analyses on largemouth bass and flathead catfish are presented in \nTable E.5. The average and range of mercury concentrations in largemouth bass (excluding the \nsingle value less than the MQL) were 0.25 μg/g and 0.08 to 0.36 μg/g, respectively. The average \n\nAppendix E  \nFish Tissue Analysis Summary October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nE-2 \nand range of mercury concentrations in flathead catfish (excluding the single value less than the \nMQL) were 0.25 μg/g and 0.14 to 0.33 μg/g, respectively (Table E.5).  \n \n3.0 DISCUSSION \n \nThe maximum mercury concentrations (Tables E.4 and E.5) are near the EPA warning \nlimit of 0.3 μg/g and below the Food and Drug Administration warning limit of 0.5 μg/g. Based \non this finding, consumption advisories or institutional controls to manage human health risks \nfrom mercury or other fish tissue contaminants common in Mississippi waters (e.g., toxaphene \nand DDT) are not warranted. \n \nTable E.1.

Included in these descriptions are \nthe agencies responsible for implementing these regulations and their associated programs, and \nthe entities that are regulated. There are a number of federal regulations that are implemented by \nstate agencies. Many of these regulations require permits to be issued. \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-2 \n2.0 FEDERAL REGULATIONS ADMINISTERED BY \nFEDERAL AGENCIES \n \nThis section describes federal regulations that apply to the Reservoir and its watershed, \nand that are implemented by federal agencies. This includes regulation of dredge and fill \nactivities, flood insurance, hazardous waste disposal, and clean-up of contaminated sites, as well \nas programs to reduce erosion and nonpoint source pollution, and track releases of toxic \nmaterials.  \n \n2.1 Clean Water Act Section 404 – Dredge and Fill Permits, and \nSection 401 – Water Quality Certification \nSeveral sections of the Clean Water Act deal with controlling impacts to navigable \nwaters. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act controls the placement of dredge or fill materials into \nwetlands and other waters of the US. Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act regulates impacts \nto navigable waters of the US. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires MDEQ to certify that \na project requiring a Section 10 or Section 404 permit will not violate the state water quality \nstandards.  \nSections 401 and 404 of the Clean Water Act require that impacts to qualifying \nwaterbodies be avoided or minimized. Where impacts are unavoidable, mitigation may be \nrequired. Qualifying waterbodies include wetlands and “other waters of the US.” The basic \ndefinition for other waters of the US, for the purpose of Section 404, is any waterbody that \ndisplays an ordinary high water mark (OHWM). This includes lakes and ponds that have a \nhydrologic connection to a qualifying waterbody; perennial and intermittent channels; and \nephemeral stream channels that exhibit an OHWM. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nadministers the regulations associated with both of these sections. \n \n\n \n \n \nF-3 \nFigure F.1. Locations of facilitie\ns in Ross Barnett Reservoir wate\nrshed under fede\nral regulation. \n \n \n \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-4 \nUSACE commonly issues two types of permits under Section 404: Individual Permits \nand Nationwide Permits (NWPs). Individual permits are required when 1) impacts to wetlands \nexceed 0.5 acre, and/or 2) impacts to a qualifying waterbody are greater than 300 linear feet. \nThe individual permit includes a period of public review, and processing generally takes \nbetween 60 and 120 days. The processing time can be greater if public hearings or environmental \nstatements are required, or if all required information on the permit application form is not \nprovided. NWPs are general permits typically used when minor impacts are necessary to \nwetlands (less than 0.5 acre) or a qualifying waterbody (any impacts less than 300 linear feet). \nProcessing time is generally less and no public review period is necessary. \nMitigation for both wetland losses or stream function and value losses may be required \nby USACE for a project authorized under either an individual or nationwide permit. The extent \nof the mitigation is dependent upon the size, quality, and functionality of the wetland or \nwaterbody to be impacted. \nThe Ross Barnett Reservoir is considered a navigable body of water by USACE and is \nsubject to regulations under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbor Act of 1889 and Section 404 of \nthe Clean Water Act. Any work on, in, or over water or wetlands requires a Section 10 permit \nand any deposition of dredged or fill material into waters or wetlands of the US requires a \nSection 404 permit, both issued by USACE. \nA general permit for Section 10 activities associated with construction of L- and \nT-shaped piers, boathouses, and gazebos on the Reservoir has been issued by USACE. A copy of \nthis permit is on file in the PRVWSD office. Certain limitations intended to protect the \nenvironment and natural and cultural resources are placed on these activities. This permit does \nnot authorize any activities resulting in the discharge of dredged or fill material. Any work \nrequiring deposition of dredged or fill material in waters or wetlands of the US will require an \nindividual permit from USACE. \nPRVWSD maintains navigational channels throughout the Reservoir. The deposition of \nthe dredged material requires an individual permit from USACE. The deposition site chosen for \nthe dredged material will be located in the least environmentally damaging location. \n \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-5 \n2.2 Clean Water Act Section 319 \nSection 319 of the Clean Water Act provides funding for projects that reduce nonpoint \nsource water pollution. EPA provides grants to states to use for implementing nonpoint source \npollution control programs. MDEQ receives Section 319 grant monies, some of which is \ndistributed to nonpoint source pollution control projects implemented by other agencies or \ninterest groups. A 40% non-federal match is required when using Section 319 grant money. \nNonpoint source pollution control projects in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed that have \nbeen funded using Section 319 grant money are described in Appendix M of the Comprehensive \nProtection and Restoration Plan. \n \n2.3 Federal Food Security Act (Farm Bill) \nUnder the Federal Food Security Act (Farm Bill), initially passed in 1985, all US farm \noperators are required to meet soil erosion control standards specified in the law. Compliance \nwith these standards is a prerequisite for participation in most federal farm programs. Subsequent \namendments to the Farm Bill have added programs that provide incentives to farm operators for \nenhancing water quality through such actions as taking highly erodible lands out of production, \nand restoring wetlands. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the Farm Bill. \nMany of the incentive programs are administered through the USDA National Resources \nConservation Service, e.g., Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP), Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). \n \n2.4 National Flood Insurance Program \nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a non-regulatory federal program \nadministered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, this program \nprovides mechanisms that can be used to restrict development in floodplains, which can have \nbeneficial effects on water quality. The NFIP supports development and enforcement of \nfloodplain management plans and ordinances. Covered communities in the watershed are Attala \nCounty, the city of Kosciusko, the town of Ackerman, Leake County, the city of Carthage, \nNeshoba County, the city of Philadelphia, Newton County, the town of Lake, Scott County, the \ncity of Forest, the city of Morton, the town of Sebastopol, Winston County, and the city of \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-6 \nLouisville. Although participation in the NFIP is not required, if a community agrees to \nparticipate, they are required to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations \n(floodplain ordinances) with minimum standards as required by federal regulations. \n \n2.5 Hazardous Waste Regulations \nFacilities that generate, store, or transport wastes containing materials identified by EPA \nas a hazardous waste (40 CFR Part 261) are regulated under the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act of 1976 (RCRA). The purpose of RCRA is to track hazardous wastes, ensuring \nthat they are disposed of properly. There are a number of facilities subject to RCRA located in \nthe Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed (Figure F.1). \n \n2.6      Superfund      \nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \n(CERCLA) and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) provide funding \nfor cleanup of abandoned sites where hazardous waste is located. Superfund was established by \nCERCLA and allows EPA to clean up such sites and to compel responsible parties to perform \ncleanups or reimburse EPA for cleanups. Contaminated sites are listed on the National Priorities \nList (NPL) upon completion of Hazard Ranking System (HRS) screening, public solicitation of \ncomments about the proposed site, and response to all comments. The CERCLA regulations \nrequire reporting of releases of toxic substances that could pose a health threat. There are a \nnumber of sites in the Ross Barnett watershed where releases and cleanups have occurred. \nLocations of these sites are indicated on Figure F.1. \n \n2.7 Toxics Release Inventory \nThe Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is authorized by the Emergency Planning and \nCommunity Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). EPCRA \nSection 313 requires EPA and states to collect data annually on releases and transfers of certain \ntoxic chemicals from industrial facilities and make the data available to the public via the TRI. \nThe goal of TRI is to provide communities with information about toxic chemical releases and \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-7 \nwaste management activities and to support informed decision-making. There are a number of \nsites in the Ross Barnett watershed included in the Toxics Release Inventory (Figure F.1). \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-8 \n3.0 FEDERAL REGULATIONS ADMINISTERED BY STATE AGENCIES \n \nFor some federal regulations that apply to the Reservoir and its watershed, authority for \nimplementation of the regulatory programs has been delegated to state agencies. \n \n3.1 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program \n3.1.1   Wastewater   Discharged   Directly to Surface Water \nThe Clean Water Act requires the control of wastewater discharges to surface waters \nunder the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination \n\nSystem (NPDES) program. MDEQ has the \ndelegated authority to administer the NPDES program in Mississippi. The Mississippi \nCommission on Environmental Quality (MCEQ) oversees MDEQ’s administration of the \nNPDES program on the state level, while EPA provides oversight at the federal level.  \nUnder the delegated authority, MDEQ issues NPDES permits to facilities that discharge \nor have the potential to discharge to waters of the state. These permits are typically issued with \nan effective term of 5 years and contain limitations on wastewater flow and/or pollutants that \nmay be discharged, as well as other conditions and/or restrictions on the discharge. Typically, \npermit limitations are based on effluent guidelines (i.e., technology-based) or state water quality \nstandards (water quality-based). NPDES permit writers also have the discretion to impose \nlimitations based on best professional judgment (BPJ) for any parameters that may pose a threat \nto the waters of the state, but for which no established effluent guideline or specific state water \nquality standard exists. The permit writer is required to provide appropriate justification for any \nBPJ limitation. \nEffluent guidelines for categorical industries have been promulgated in 40 CFR Parts 400 \nthrough 699. These limitations represent the type and quantity of pollutants expected to be \ndischarged from a particular industry after the wastewater has received a specified degree of \ntreatment. MDEQ is prohibited from issuing NPDES permits with limitations that are less \nstringent than the effluent guidelines, but may require more stringent limitations if deemed \nnecessary to protect the water quality and beneficial uses of the receiving stream. \nIn addition to pollutant limitations, major dischargers and select minor discharges will \nhave biomonitoring requirements included in the NPDES permit. Biomonitoring tests involve the \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-9 \nplacement of test organisms in varying concentrations of effluent to evaluate toxicity. Based on \nthe ratio of effluent to receiving stream flow at critical conditions (7Q10), a critical dilution will \nbe determined that represents the minimum concentration at which no toxicity must be observed.  \nPermittees are required to perform self-monitoring through routine effluent sampling. \nSampling results are reported to MDEQ regularly on discharge monitoring reports (DMRs). In \naddition to self-monitoring, MDEQ inspectors perform routine compliance inspections of \npermitted facilities. Enforcement measures, including fines and permit revocation, are available \nto MDEQ when addressing noncompliance by dischargers.  \nAs of October 2009, there were approximately 45 sites in the Ross Barnett watershed \nwith active individual NPDES permits for discharge of wastewater to surface waters.\n1\n Eleven of \nthese sites were classified as municipal wastewater dischargers. The remainder of the sites were \nclassified as industrial or commercial wastewater dischargers. There are also several ready-mix \n(concrete and asphalt) operations in the watershed that are covered by a general NPDES \nwastewater discharge permit. Discharges of wastewater from wet decks at sawmills are also \ncovered by a general NPDES wastewater discharge permit. The locations of facilities with \nNPDES wastewater permits are indicated on Figure F.1. \n \n3.1.2    Wastewater Discharged Indirectly to Surface Water \nThe Clean Water Act effluent limitations guidelines (40 CFR 400 through 699) also \nspecify discharge limitations for categorical industries discharging to collection systems for \nmunicipal wastewater treatment facilities. Unlike most states, the federal pretreatment program \nin Mississippi is run at the state level, as opposed to the city level. Therefore, those industries \nseeking to discharge to municipal systems must obtain a pretreatment permit from the state. As \nof October 2009, there were four pretreatment permits active for industries that discharge \npretreated wastewater into a municipal wastewater treatment system. The locations of these \nfacilities are indicated on Figure F.1. \n \n                                                \n \n1\n http://opc.deq.state.ms.us/default.aspx \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-10 \n3.1.3   Industrial   Stormwater   Permits   \nIndustrial stormwater is permitted through a state general permit. As of October 2009, \napproximately 30 industrial sites in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed were under the \nMississippi baseline stormwater general permit.\n2\n Locations of these sites are indicated on \nFigure F.1 as “baseline stormwater.” \n \n3.1.4   Construction Stormwater Permits \nConstruction stormwater is covered under a state general permit. In October 2009, \n37 sites in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed had coverage under the large construction \nstormwater general permit, which applies to sites where more than 5 acres of land are disturbed.\n3\n \nLocations of these sites are indicated on Figure F.1. \n \n3.1.5   Mining Stormwater Permits \nThere are several sand and gravel mines located in Rankin County near Highway 25, \nHighway 471, and Wirtz Road. Mining activities cause significant disturbance of land surfaces, \nwhich may contribute to sediment pollution in nearby waters if not properly controlled. MDEQ \nrequires mining facilities to obtain coverage under a general stormwater permit and develop a \nstormwater pollution prevention plan. Facilities receiving coverage under the mining general \npermit must implement erosion and sediment controls during mining activities, maintain erosion \nand sediment controls after mining until the site is stabilized, and conduct regular inspections to \nensure the controls are adequate and working. Mining sites greater than 4 acres are also required \nto obtain a mining permit from the office of geology and must have a plan for reclamation of the \nsite. Additional information on mining sites in the watershed is included in Appendix H to the \nComprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan. \n \n3.1.6   Municipal   Storm   Sewer Systems Permits \nThere are several areas within the Ross Barnett watershed that are required to develop \nStormwater Management Plans required under the Clean Water Act Storm Water Phase II Rule \n                                                \n \n2\n http://opc.deq.state.ms.us/default.aspx  \n3\n Ibid. \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-11 \nfor municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). These areas are Rankin County, the City of \nFlowood, Madison County, the City of Madison, and the City of Ridgeland. The Mississippi \nDepartment of Transportation (MDOT) also has a Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) that \napplies to road construction and maintenance in Rankin and Madison counties. \nEach stormwater management plan must include six control measures. The control \nmeasures are as follows: \n \n1. Public education and outreach, \n2. Public participation and involvement, \n3. Illicit discharge detection and elimination, \n4. Construction site stormwater controls, \n5. Post construction stormwater controls, and \n6. Pollution prevention and good housekeeping. \n \n3.1.7   Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations \nConcentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) of greater than 1,000 animal units, or \nthat are determined to be a threat to water quality, are required to obtain a federal CAFO permit \nunder the NPDES program administered by MDEQ. In Mississippi, these facilities are covered \nunder a state general permit. There are currently six permitted CAFO facilities located in the \nRoss Barnett Reservoir watershed. All of these facilities are swine operations located in Winston \nand Choctaw counties in the upper part of the watershed. The locations of these sites are \nindicated on Figure F.1. \nAll CAFOs are required to develop a nutrient management program. NRCS typically \nprovides guidance to individual growers for developing these programs. These programs \ndescribe manure management practices to ensure no runoff is generated that could potentially \ntransport manure to nearby waterbodies during rain events. Nutrient management programs must \nalso be submitted to MDEQ and approved before coverage under a CAFO general permit is \nissued. Animal feeding operations that meet the CAFO criteria, as defined by the Clean Water \nAct, are permitted for water discharges through general permits administered by MDEQ.  \n \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-12 \n3.2 Safe Drinking Water Act \nAll drinking water systems serving 25 people or more are considered public drinking \nwater systems and are subject to EPA regulation through the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). \nElements of the SDWA include the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, Disinfection \nByproducts Rule, the requirement for Source Water Assessment and Protection, and the \nUnderground Injection Control (UIC) Program. In Mississippi, the SDWA is administered by the \nMississippi State Department of Health (MSDH). The exception to this is the requirement for \nSource Water Assessment and Protection. In 1998, MSDH contracted with MDEQ to develop \nand administer the Source Water Assessment Program (SWAP). MDEQ received EPA approval \nof the SWAP Plan in November 1999 (MDEQ 1999) before initiating efforts to implement the \nprogram. \nMDEQ administers the UIC program in Mississippi. The UIC program is responsible for \nregulating the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells that place fluids \nunderground for storage or disposal. This program provides permitting and guidance to allow the \nsafe operation of injection wells to prevent contamination of underground drinking water \nresources. \n \n3.3      Underground      Storage Tank Regulations \nUnderground storage tanks (USTs) are regulated under federal programs. EPA has \ndelegated to the state of Mississippi the authority to implement this program in Mississippi. \nUSTs that contain hazardous substances and/or petroleum are regulated under Subtitle I of \nRCRA. USTs containing hazardous wastes are regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA. \nUnder the Mississippi Underground Storage Tank Regulations, owners are required to \nnotify MDEQ of installation, replacement, closure, or transfer of ownership. In these \nnotifications, owners must certify that they are compliant with the requirements of the \nregulations, including those for installation, cathodic protection of steel components, financial \nresponsibility, and leak detection. As of October 2009, there were approximately \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-13 \n670 underground storage tanks registered with MDEQ in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed.\n4\n \nLocations of these storage tanks are indicated on Figure F.1. \n                                                \n \n4\n http://opc.deq.state.ms.us/default.aspx \n\nAppendix F  \nFederal and State Regulations Relevant to Restoration and Protection October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nF-14 \n4.0 STATE REGULATIONS \n \nThere are also state regulations that apply to the Reservoir and its watershed. \n \n4.1      Onsite      Wastewater      Treatment Regulations \nState regulations addressing onsite wastewater treatment systems are administered \nthrough MSDH. Regulations are in place to address single-family residence onsite wastewater \ntreatment systems, as well as onsite systems serving recreational vehicle campgrounds, \ndevelopments, and multi-family dwellings. These regulations require approval and certification \nof all new installations of onsite wastewater treatment systems, including replacement of old \nsystems. Certification is not required for systems in use prior to enactment of the regulations, \nproviding they meet criteria specified in the regulations.\n5\n \n \n4.2 Surface Mining Regulations \nThe Mississippi Surface Mining and Reclamation Rules and Regulations\n6\n are \nadministered by MDEQ. These regulations require surface mining operations to obtain a permit \nto operate from MDEQ and provide for reclamation of the mine site when operations cease. The \nregulations also provide a mechanism for prohibiting surface mining in areas by designating \nthem as land unsuitable for mining. Environmentally sensitive areas can be designated as land \nunsuitable for mining.\n7\n Surface mines that disturb an area 4 acres or larger must also obtain a \npermit from the MDEQ Office of Geology. Locations of sites in the Ross Barnett Reservoir \nwatershed that hold a surface mining permit are shown on Figure F.2. \n \n \n                                                \n \n5\n http://www.msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/30,0,78.html, accessed June 2010 \n6\n http://www.deq.state.ms.us/newweb/mdeqregulations.nsf/f75488ee863070bd86256df300511acf/ \n12629755e7eda67e8625765e004ba561/$FILE/GEO-1%20Proposed%20amendment%202009.pdf \n7\n Ibid. \n\n \n \n \nF-15 \nFigure F.2.

MDOT is \nrequired to apply to MDEQ for a Certificate of Permit Coverage for construction projects to be \npermitted through the state construction stormwater general permit. \n \n4.4 Surface Water Quality Regulations and/or Criteria \nThe state water quality standards (WQS) adopted by MDEQ are published in the State of \nMississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters.\n8\n The WQS \ninclude designated uses for waterbodies and numeric and narrative criteria to protect these uses. \nDesignated uses for Ross Barnett Reservoir include Fish and Wildlife Support (aquatic life \nsupport), Public Water Supply, and Recreation. All other waterbodies in the watershed have the \nWQS designated use of Fish and Wildlife Support. Numeric and narrative criteria for selected \nparameters are summarized in Table F.1. \n \n4.5      Public      Waterways      \nState regulations\n9\n designate all sections of natural flowing streams with mean annual flow \nof at least 100 cfs as public waterways. These are waterways where the public has the “right of \nfree transport in the stream and its bed, and the right to fish and engage in water sports.” \nHowever, access to public waters is generally restricted to developed public access points. The \ndesignated Public Waterways in Ross Barnett watershed are as follows: \n \n1. Ross Barnett Reservoir, \n2. Pearl River, \n3. Pelahatchie Creek downstream of Eutacutachee Creek, \n4. Coffee Bogue downstream of Lee Branch, \n5.

These data are \nsummarized based on whether the stream was impaired, whether the stream is supporting its \ndesignated uses, and/or whether the stream was assessed. \n \n2.0 TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS AND TURBIDITY DATA \n \nBox-and-whisker plots of the TSS measurements from streams supporting and not \nsupporting designated uses appear to be statistically different (Table G.1, Figure G.1). However, \nplots of turbidity measurements from streams supporting and not supporting designated uses do \nnot show significant differences (Table G.2, Figure G.2). \n \n3.0 TOTAL NITROGEN AND TOTAL PHOSPHORUS DATA \n \nThe plot of total phosphorus measurements from streams supporting and not supporting \ndesignated uses appears to indicate a statistical difference (Table G.3, Figure G.3). The same is \nnot true for total nitrogen; plots of total nitrogen measurements do not show significant \ndifferences between those streams supporting designated uses and those not supporting their \ndesignated uses. However, few total nitrogen measurements (only 23 samples) were available for \nstatistical analysis (Table G.4, Figure G.4). \n \n\nAppendix G  \nData Comparison for TMDL Versus Non-TMDL Streams October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nG-2 \nNANoYes\nSupporting Designated Uses\n-20\n20\n60\n100\nTSS, mg/L\nFigure G.1.

Biological sampling of stream benthic communities was conducted in \nthe monitored waterbody segments using the Mississippi Benthic Index of Stream Quality. \nThrough a stressor identification process, MDEQ has determined that sediment is the probable \nprimary cause of biological impairment in many of the monitored waterbodies (MDEQ and Ray \nMontgomery Associates 2009). TMDLs have been completed for the majority of these \nimpairments. Cane Creek, Pelahatchie Creek, Fannegusha Creek, and sections of the Pearl River \nare of particular concern because they are located in the 1x:10x watershed and flow directly to \nthe Reservoir. Hurricane Creek, Red Cane Creek, Coffee Bogue, and Eutahatchee Creek and are \nalso located in the 1x:10x watershed. Other locations with sediment issues were identified based \non stakeholder input. These include Mill Creek, Turtle Creek, and tributaries to Pelahatchie Bay. \nThere are three major sedimentation zones in the Ross Barnett Reservoir: upstream of the \nHighway 43 Bridge, upstream of the Northshore Parkway Bridge (over the mouth of Pelahatchie \nBay), and in front of the dam. In all reservoirs, sedimentation occurs in front of the dam. Both \nthe Highway 43 Bridge and the Northshore Parkway have only one relatively narrow opening \nthrough which water can flow. This situation effectively creates sedimentation basins in the \nupper Reservoir and Pelahatchie Bay. \n \n1.2      Sediment      Sources      \nMost of the sediment in the Reservoir comes from erosion sites in the watershed, and is \ntransported by the Reservoir’s tributaries. Tributaries to Pelahatchie Bay in particular have high \nsediment loads. NRCS has noted that visual observation shows wa\n\nter flowing into Pelahatchie \nBay from tributaries has extremely high turbidity after storm events (MDEQ et al. 2008). MDEQ \nconsiders sediment contributions from disturbed land areas (e.g., construction areas) near the \nReservoir to be one of the most significant issues impacting Reservoir water quality. The Mill \nCreek watershed on the eastern side of the Reservoir in Rankin County is an area of specific \nconcern. \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-2 \n1.2.1   In-Reservoir Sediment Sources \nThere are multiple sources of sediment from within the Reservoir itself. These include \nerosion of the lake bed and banks and resuspension of sediment due to wave action. The Ross \nBarnett Reservoir is an extremely shallow system (average depth of 10 ft), making it susceptible \nfor resuspended sediment due to wind/wave effects. Resuspension indices indicate that the \nReservoir is likely to have a significant amount of resuspended sediments (Table H.1). \nAdditional information regarding the potential for wind effects on the Reservoir is included in \nAppendix I of the Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan. \n \nTable H.1. Resuspension indices for the Reservoir. \n \nIndex Result Indications \nDynamic Ratio    Greater than 3 \n“Lakes with values greater than 0.8 are most likely to have \nproblems with sediment resuspension” (Bachmann et al. 2000). \nAreal Erosion 75.7% \nIndicates the percentage of the lake bed likely to be subject to \nerosion process and sediment transport, including those resulting \nfrom wave action. \n \n1.2.2   Upland Sediment Sources \nUpland activities that may contribute to increased sediment loads in streams include \nconstruction, surface mining, land clearing for residential and commercial development, \nincreased impervious surface area, harvesting of forested areas, row crop agriculture, and \ndisturbance of stream banks by grazing animals. Alteration of stream channels (straightening and \nwidening) and removing vegetation in the riparian area near stream banks make streams much \nmore likely to have higher sediment loads. In addition, developed areas of the Reservoir \nshoreline can contribute sediments to the Reservoir, as removal/alteration of the natural \nvegetation and other features of the shoreline can diminish the natural ability of riparian areas to \nfilter and remove sediment from water draining into the Reservoir. Presently, vegetation has \nbeen removed from approximately 25% of the Reservoir shoreline for development\n1\n. \n                                                \n \n1\n Based on examination of aerial photographs. \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-3 \nPermitted activities that contribute to sediment loads include construction and surface \nmining. The locations of current mining stormwater and construction stormwater permits in the \nReservoir watershed are shown on Figure H.1. \nDue to rapid development along the Highway 25 corridor, runoff from construction sites \nhas become an important issue. A recent study conducted by Millsaps College included an \nanalysis of the bed material found in Mill Creek along its entire length (headwaters near Brandon \nfrom its mouth in Pelahatchie Bay). This study provided some evidence that development and \nalteration of the land use is directly impacting Mill Creek (Killcreas and Musselman 2009). The \nstudy divided Mill Creek into three zones for analysis of bed material. \n \n• Zone 1, small upstream tributaries – dominated by medium and fine sands; \n• Zone 2, along the main stem of Mill creek for a distance of 5 km – grain size \nvaried greatly; and \n• Zone 3, lower 0.5-km reach to confluence with Pelahatchie Bay: 50 to 70% \nmedium sands with less than 10% fines. This was unexpected since the geologic \nformation of this area is dominated by silts and clays. Author concluded that \nZone 1 was that the sediment source, and increased discharge due to development \ntransported the larger particles to Zone 3.  \n \nThe report also discusses anthropogenic modifications such as straightening, residential \ndevelopment including Castlewoods golf course, channel protection with rip-rap, and a low head \ndam on Mill Creek located approximately 1 kilometer south of spillway road. The report also \npresent evidence of significant increases in stream flow (Killcreas and Musselman 2009). The \nincreased flow is likely the result of recent increased development and impervious area in the \nwatershed. \n \n\n \n \n \nH-4 \nFigure H.1. Agency interests that \nare potential sediment sources. \n \n \n \n \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-5 \nSediment releases from construction sites are regulated through stormwater pollution \nprevention plans (SWPPPs) and local ordinances. MDEQ issues Large (disturbance of 5 acres or \ngreater) and Small (disturbance of one acre to less than 5 acres) Construction Storm Water \nGeneral Permits. MDEQ requires that all construction sites that are one acre or larger develop an \nSWPPP that contains measures to reduce soil erosion and control sediments and describes how \nand when these measures will be implemented on the construction site. Developers of sites \n5 acres or larger must submit a notice of intent (NOI) and SWPPP to MDEQ for approval prior \nto starting construction. Construction sites smaller than one acre are permitted by local \ngovernment and managed through ordinances and inspections administered by the county or city \ngovernment in authority over each particular area. PRVWSD also has requirements for specific \nsediment control practices on individual lots specified in their building permit requirements. Silt \nfences must be properly installed, inspected, and maintained during construction\n2\n. \nWatersheds that contain a significant portion of impervious area are at risk for excessive \nerosion and sediment contribution to the Reservoir. Research has shown that runoff is directly \ncorrelated to the amount of impervious surface area in a watershed. Increased imperviousness \nleads to increased amounts of water flowing in stream channels during rain events, resulting in \nflooding, habitat loss, erosion and widening of the stream channel. Physical changes to the \nstream channel occur as stream channels seek a new equilibrium. The time of concentration, or \namount of time that it takes water to travel from land surfaces to receiving streams, also \ndecreases in highly impervious watersheds causing higher peak flows (D’Ambrosio et al. 2004). \nNegative impacts due to impervious surfaces can occur in areas with as little as 5% impervious \nareas. Streams in parts of the watershed with a high percentage of impervious area are more \nlikely to be impacted by channel erosion and downstream sedimentation issues. The percentages \nof impervious area in each of the HUC12s in the Ross Barnett watershed are shown on \nFigure H.2. \n                                                \n \n2\n http://www.therez.ms/residential1.html \n\n \n \n \nH-6 \n \n \n \nFigure H.2. Impervious area in each \nHUC12 in the Ross Barnett watershed. \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-7 \nThe HUC12 that contains Pelahatchie Bay (Mill Creek – Pelahatchie Creek, HUC12 \nNo. 031800020307) is approximately 7.4% impervious based on 2006 land use data. The HUC12 \nadjacent to the lower part of the Reservoir (No. 031800020401) contains 4.4% impervious area. \nOther subwatersheds with 8% to 10% impervious surfaces include the HUC12s that contain the \ncities of Morton, Philadelphia, Koscuisko, and Louisville. \n \n1.2.3   Sediment Sources from Forested Lands \nAlmost 50% of the watershed is forested land (Figure H.3). Most forested areas in the \nReservoir watershed are loblolly/shortleaf pine and hardwood timberlands. Forest lands in the \nReservoir watershed are managed by private landowners, businesses, or government agencies. \nApproximately 12,455 acres of the land that borders the Reservoir is currently managed as forest \nland by PRVWSD. PRVWSD has developed a 10-year forestry management plan that supports \nmultiple forest uses and includes plans for managing and harvesting timber in each parcel. \nTimber harvesting activities are aimed at harvesting mature timber and improving timber stands \nin other areas. The plan allows forest harvest near recreational areas of the Reservoir only when \nit is necessary to improve overall forest health. There are several areas adjacent to the upper \nReservoir that PRVWSD has set aside as streamside management zones. Some of the timber land \nis in a wildlife management area managed by MDWFP. Timber harvesting in this area is limited \nand done in accordance with MDWFP objectives (PRVWSD, no date). \nThe Mississippi Forestry Commission (MFC) conducts a survey every 3 years of BMP \nimplementation on randomly selected areas. The results of this survey are available to the public. \nThe most recent survey was conducted on 237 randomly selected sites in 2010. This survey \nconcluded that statewide, 93% of BMPs installed at the survey sites were implemented in \naccordance with guidelines of the state forestry agencies. Areas where forestry management \npractices are not properly implemented can contribute significant amounts of sediment. \nForest lands that have been harvested in recent years are more likely to contribute \nsediment to streams draining into the Reservoir. Harvested areas where the vegetative cover and \ncanopy are removed are significantly more susceptible to erosion. Harvest records for privately \nowned forest lands are not available; however, MFC reports that approximately 4% of forest \nlands in Mississippi have activities each year (MFC 2008). \n\n \n \n \nH-8 \n \n \n \nFigure H.3. Landuses in the Reservoir watershed. \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-9 \nMFC tracks timber inventory, growth, drain and growth to drain ratio for pine and \nhardwood forests. Information is available by county. The timber inventory is based on surveys \nconducted in 2004 and 2006. Growth represents the amount of timber growth on forestland since \nthe inventory measured in tons. Drain is an estimate of timber harvested, based on the Timber \nSeverance Tax.  \nThe timber industry often uses a ratio of growth/drain to estimate sustainability of forest \nresources. Growth/drain ratio greater than 1 indicates an increase in forest resources. The \naverage ratio for counties in the reservoir watershed is 2.5 for softwoods and 4.1 for hardwoods. \nThe total amount of removal in Reservoir counties during the inventory period until 2009 was \n17% for softwoods and 4% of the hardwoods.  \n \n1.2.4   Sediment Sources from Construction Sites and Surface Mines \nProper use of BMPs at construction sites is vital to improved water quality in the \nReservoir watershed. The Reservoir and much of its surrounding land in Rankin County are \nlocated in the Loess Plains Ecoregion, which contains the most highly erosive soil in the state \n(ecoregions are shown on Figure H.4). Removal of natural vegetative cover will lead to \nsignificant erosion if the soil surface is left unprotected. Because of this, management of \nconstruction sites and surface mines is extremely important. Disturbed soils in this area should \nbe replanted with vegetative cover as soon as possible. \nSpecifications for the design of BMPs are given in the recently updated Planning and \nDesign Manual for the Control of Erosion, Sediment, and Stormwater (Planning and Design \nManual) (MDEQ 2011). The Planning and Design Manual describes BMPs for use during and \nafter construction to prevent erosion and treat stormwater. The Large and Small Construction \nStorm Water General Permits, as well as most stormwater management plans and local \nordinances, require that practices be designed according to the specifications in the Planning and \nDesign Manual.  \n \n\n \n \n \nH-10 \n \n \n \nFigure H.4. Ecoregions in the Ro\nss Barnett Reservoir watershed. \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-11 \nMDEQ’s Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Division (ECED) leads the Ross \nBarnett Reservoir Stormwater Compliance Initiative. The Initiative, which began in 2007, is \nworking to improve stormwater management at construction sites and surface mines located in \nthe Reservoir watershed, particularly in areas rapid commercial and residential development. The \nInitiative has included the following activities: \n \n• Frequent informal surveys of the area and increased compliance evaluation \ninspections at facilities with coverage under the large construction stormwater and \nsurface mining general permits, along with frequent informal “windshield \nsurveys” of the area; \n• Increased enforcement actions; \n• Additional review of SWPPPs for new developments (MDEQ’s ECED reviews \nSWPPPs to ensure adequate design of construction/mining BMPs. This review \nwill be in addition to the review typically conducted by the Environmental \nPermitting Division); \n• Improved communication with local authorities; and \n• Enhanced stormwater management plans in MS4 areas. \n \nMDEQ inspectors have conducted “windshield surveys” to document the condition and \neffectiveness of management practices before, during, and after storm events. Photographs taken \nby MDEQ personnel during rain events in 2009 show insufficient BMPs in several newly \ndeveloped subdivisions near the Reservoir including Lost Rabbit, Latter Rayne, Gardens of \nMansdale, Hidden Hills, and Arbor Landing. Photographs show turbid water draining from \nconstruction sites in improperly stabilized ditches. Increased turbidity was visible in the \nReservoir near construction sites in Lost Rabbit and Arbor Landing developments. Subsequent \nvisits to these sites have shown improvements including the establishment of vegetation and \nrip-rap stabilization along drainage ditches, properly installed silt fences, and improved function \nof stormwater detention ponds. \nResults of inspections over recent years are summarized in Table H.2. Lack of education \namong contractors and a reluctance to fund the cost of installing and maintaining BMPs are the \nmost common reasons for regulation violations. Activities in 2009 show a decrease in fines from \nprevious years. MDEQ cited the reasons for the decrease as a slower economy resulting in a \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-12 \ndecrease in large construction projects. MDEQ also noted that recent inspections showed that \nstormwater rules have been more strictly enforced and projects are being more closely managed. \n \nTable H.2.

CEIs have resulted in a significant number \nof NOVs and monetary fines. Active large construction sites that have been issued NOVs \nin 2008, 2009, or 2010 are included in Table H.3. The locations of these facilities are shown on \nFigure H.5. \n \nTable H.3.

According to MDEQ personnel, the majority of violations in the \nReservoir watershed have been corrected, and developers and contractors have improved \nperformance on installing and maintaining BMPs. However, the pace of development has \ndecreased significantly due to the recent economic downturn. It will be important to for \ndevelopers to continue their efforts when development increases in future years (personal \ncommunication, Steve Bailey, MDEQ, December 2010). \nFinally, MDEQ is working to improve coordination with the local authorities regulating \nsmall construction general permit sites. When violations at small construction sites are noted, \nMDEQ first works with the local authorities to resolve problems. Working at the local level is \nthe most efficient way to improve enforcement. Local authorities are responsible for enforcement \nof SWPPPs on individual lots in developments that are covered under the large construction \nstormwater general permit. Local stormwater managers have noted that stormwater and sediment \ncontrol on individual lots are often the most neglected. The City of Flowood is currently working \nwith the local developers, contractors, and inspectors to improve this issue (personal \ncommunication, Garry Miller, City of Flowood Public Works Director, February 20\n\n11). \nLocal governments conduct the majority of inspections on small construction sites. The \nnumber of sites, inspections, and enforcement actions are reported to MDEQ in annual MS4 \nreports. Table H.4 shows the number of sites for each MS4 entity as of December 2010. \n \nTable H.4. MS4 sites per county and number of inspections and enforcement actions per site. \n \nMS4 Entity \nSmall Construction \nSite Permitted \nNumber of \nInspections* \nNumber of \nEnforcement Actions*\nRankin County 249 693 38 \nCity of Madison 8 Not available - \nCity of Ridgeland 10 90 0 \nCity of Flowood 120 daily 30 \nMadison County Not available - - \n* January – December 2010 \n \nMDEQ is also conducting inspections at all surface mines in the Reservoir watershed. \nPrevious inspections have noted violations at two surface mines in the Pelahatchie Bay \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-15 \nwatershed and resulted in monetary fines of up to $30,000. MDEQ has identified three sites with \nnon-permitted surface mining activities located in the Pelahatchie Bay watershed and has worked \nwith these facilities to obtain permits and install proper BMPs. Inspections after rain events are \nalso used to visually identify areas with elevated turbidity and high amounts of suspended \nsediments, which can sometimes be traced back to source areas. \n \n1.2.5   Sediment Sources from Grazing Lands \nApproximately 16% of the land in the watershed is classified as pasture/grassland, and \nmay be used for grazing animals. Grazing animals on pasture lands are often allowed to enter \nstreams in order to access water and cooler, shaded areas. Animal access to streams, however, \ncan damage stream beds and banks and may cause erosion. There is no specific information \navailable to locate areas in the watershed where animal access occurs. However, because there \nare cattle located in the watershed, pastures are a potential source of sediment loads to streams. \n \n \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-16 \n2.0 NUTRIENTS \n \n2.1 Locations of Concern for Nutrients \nExcess nutrients and subsequent growth of algae and other aquatic plants may occur in \nany area of the Reservoir within the depth of the photic zone. Excessive algae would be of \nconcern at any location in the Reservoir, since this water may potentially flow to the drinking \nwater intake. The area of the Reservoir of greatest concern, however, is in the area in the vicinity \nof the O.B. Curtis drinking water treatment plant intake.  \nIn near-shore areas of the Reservoir, nutrients can contribute to excessive growth of \naquatic macrophytes. MDWFP has observed thick mats of aquatic vegetation in parts of \nPelahatchie Bay and the upper Reservoir upstream of Highway 43 (Bull 2010). \nLow dissolved oxygen conditions have been observed at monitoring station RBR1, \nlocated near the Reservoir dam. Low dissolved oxygen levels were measured in the hypolimnion \nduring the summer when increased algae growth (and death) rates occurred during temperature \nstratification, preventing transfer of oxygen to the bottom water. \n \n2.2      Nutrient      Sources      \nThe primary types of nutrient sources in the Reservoir watershed are nutrients naturally \npresent in the soil and nutrients applied to the landscape for land management activities. \nNutrients are carried to the Reservoir through surface water flow, either dissolved in the water \n(typically nitrogen) or sorbed to suspended sediment particles (typically phosphorus). Nutrient \nsources in the watershed include stormwater from urban areas, failing septic systems, permitted \ndischarge of treated wastewater, atmospheric deposition, and agricultural activities. \nNutrients are naturally present in the watershed because they are contained in soils. The \nquantity of nitrogen found in Mississippi soils is closely related to levels of organic matter and \ntypically ranges from 500 to 2,000 lbs/acre (Oldham 2003). According to research conducted by \nMSU, more than 90% of the nitrogen in soils is associated with organic matter. Phosphorus is \ntypically present in low levels in soils in central Mississippi, but can vary significantly from \nplace to place due to current and historical land management practices. Most soils in Mississippi \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-17 \nare slightly acidic, which causes inorganic phosphorus to bind with cations and form insoluble \nprecipitates that are not available for plant uptake (Oldham 2008). \nAtmospheric deposition is another known source of nitrogen in surface waters. USGS \nquantified the contribution of atmospheric nitrogen along with four other nitrogen sources: \nwastewater, fertilizer, livestock manure, and urban areas. According to output from the USGS \nmodel, Spatially Referenced Regression on Watersheds (SPARROW), atmospheric deposition is \nthe most significant incremental yield of nitrogen in watersheds contributing to the Ross Barnett \nReservoir (Hoos and McMahon 2009). \nThe SPARROW model results show that manure from livestock production, and to a \nlesser extent, nitrogen from commercial fertilizer applied to agricultural land contribute to \ninstream nitrogen yield. Figure H.6 shows the nitrogen yields for the Reservoir watershed and \nthe relative contribution of each source category (Hoos and McMahon 2009). These results \nindicate that nitrogen yields (kilograms per hectare) were highest in the Hontokalo Creek and \nCobbs Creek watersheds. These two watersheds contain the towns of Forest and Koscuicko, \nrespectively. These towns have major (greater than 1 MGD) NPDES-permitted wastewater \ntreatment facilities, which are the largest nitrogen sources in these subwatersheds. Model output \nfor phosphorus is not yet available. \nDenitrification, the conversion of ammonia nitrogen to nitrogen gas, is an important \nremoval process that should be considered in the nitrogen balance. Nitrogen gas is produced \nthrough denitrification and released to the atmosphere, removing it from the water. \nDenitrification occurs under anoxic conditions and may be a significant pathway of nitrogen \nremoval in the Reservoir and its tributaries. \n \n\n \n \n \nH-18 \nFigure H.6. Modeled nitrogen yields for 12-di\ngit HUCs in the Ross Barnett watershed. \n \n \n \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-19 \nPhosphorus in Reservoir sediments can also be a significant contributor to nutrient \nenrichment and eutrophication, particularly in shallow lakes (Wetzel 1983, Cole 1983, \nCooke et al. 1977). Phosphorus in reservoir sediments comes from tributary inputs of \nphosphorus-rich sediment, and dead algae, plants, and animals. When phosphorus-rich sediments \nin lakes and reservoirs are exposed to anoxic (low dissolved oxygen) conditions, the phosphorus \nis released from the sediment into the water column (Wetzel 1983, Cole 1983, Correll 1998, \nCarpenter 2005). In addition, phosphorus in sediment can become available in the water column \nwhen the sediments are resuspended by waves, boats, dredging, etc (Wetzel 1983). High \nphosphorus levels in sediments in shallower areas of the Reservoir can support abundant growth \nof aquatic and semi-aquatic plants (macrophytes) (Wetzel 1983). There are instances where \nphosphorus from lake and reservoir sediments has been found to contribute significantly to \neutrophic conditions in the waterbody (Cooke et al. 1977, Cole 1983, Wetzel 1983, \nCarpenter 2005). \n \n2.2.1   Nutrient Sources from Urban and Landscaped Areas \nApplication of fertilizers by homeowners is a significant source of nutrients in the \nReservoir. There are many residential subdivisions directly adjacent to the Reservoir. Nitrogen \nfertilizer is often applied by homeowners in excessive amounts, sometimes much greater than the \namount actually needed based on plant needs (personal communication, Houston Therrell. \nRankin County Extension Service, March 2010). Nitrogen fertilizers are often applied in the \nform of ammonia, which can be readily used by plants once it reaches aquatic systems. \nSediments washing from landscaped urban areas can also carry phosphorus into the Reservoir. \nResearch has shown that 50% to 90% of phosphorus movement within the landscape is attached \nto sediment particles (Oldham 2008). \nStormwater from urban areas may also contribute significant nutrients to the Reservoir \nand its tributaries. Urban areas near the Reservoir include Madison, Ridgeland, and Flowood. \nAlthough there are no data currently available to quantify the amount of nutrients contributed by \nthese areas, research has shown that nutrients from urban areas can be significantly elevated. \nResearch conducted by Beaulac and Reckhow found that phosphorus contributions from urban \nland can be as much as ten times higher than from forested land (1982). Sources of nutrients in \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-20 \nurban stormwater include fertilizer applied to landscaped areas, failing septic systems, and pet \nwaste.  \n \n2.2.2   Nutrient Sources from Wastewater Treatment \nSeptic systems are located throughout the watershed. These systems are a potential \nnutrient source if they are not properly maintained. Additional detail on the location and \ncondition of failing septic systems in the four HUCs that are closest to the Reservoir can be \nfound in the Ross Barnett Reservoir Pathogen Source Assessment and Wastewater Management \nPlan (CDM 2010).Point source discharges, particularly those from wastewater treatment plants \n(WWTPs), contain high levels of nitrogen and phosphorous.  \nThere are currently 31 municipal and private facilities in the Reservoir watershed \npermitted to discharge treated wastewater. Most of the facilities use conventional or aerated \nlagoons and disinfection to treat wastewater. The facilities are required to submit monthly or \nannual monitoring reports to MDEQ to ensure that they are meeting permit limits for flow, \ntemperature, pH, and turbidity and loads of organic material, bacteria, and nutrients.  \nThere are three major municipal NPDES-permitted facilities in the watershed, the Forest \nPOTW (MS0020362), Kosciusko POTW South (MS0027774), and Philadelphia POTW \n(MS0021156). Major municipal facilities are those with flows of 1.0 MGD or greater. These \nfacilities’ permits require them to monitor their effluent for total nitrogen levels. Municipal \nWWTPs with minor NPDES permits (i.e., flows less than 1 MGD) discharge treated wastewater \nfrom the towns of Forest, Walnut Grove, Carthage, Noxapater, Kosciusko, Weir, and Louisville. \nThe POTW for the town of Carthage has a maximum permitted flow of 0.95 MGD and \ndischarges treated effluent into Town Creek, a tributary of the Pearl River. Table H.5 includes a \nlist of NPDES permits that would be considered nutrient sources. This list includes municipal \nand commercial wastewater treatment and selected industrial facilities. The locations of these \npoint source facilities are shown on Figure H.7.  \n \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-21 \nTable H.5.

The violations \nare summarized in Table H.6. Locations of the facilities are shown on Figure H.5.There are two \nfacilities with compliance issues located within the direct tributaries of the Reservoir: Reservoir \nEast Subdivision and Pelahatchie publicly owned treatment works (POTW), West. There are \ncurrently no enforcement actions against these facilities. However, MDEQ is reviewing \ndischarge monitoring data for these facilities and may proceed with enforcement actions if \npermit violations continue. \nThere is currently one facility classified as a major industrial NPDES permit, Tyson \nFoods Inc., River Valley Animal Foods, Forest (Permit No. MS0046931). This facility currently \nhas a maximum permitted flow of 0.95 MGD and discharges treated wastewater into an unnamed \ntributary of Tallabogue Creek. This facility has had no recent significant permit compliance \nissues. There were minor exceedances of permitted levels of total suspended solids (TSS) \nreported in June 2008; however, the difference between the reported value and permit limit was \nless than 4%. \n \n2.2.3   Nutrient Sources from Agricultural Operations \nAgricultural facilities include animal growing operations that generate animal manure \nand treated wastewater from poultry processing facilities. There are 334 facilities that have dry \npoultry AFO permits in the Reservoir watershed. MDEQ requires operators to develop nutrient \nmanagement plans for their facilities that specify methods for disposing of poultry litter. Poultry \nlitter is either applied to the operator’s land according to the management plan or sold to third \nparties who use the litter for fertilizer. According to MDEQ, the most common issues from these \nfacilities are due to complaints due to odor from land application of manure. Often the \ncomplaints are due to application by a third party, so the complaints can’t be tracked to a \nparticular permit holder. \n \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-25 \nTable H.6.

The most recent census was conducted in 2007, \nissued in February 2009, and updated December 2009. Census data from 2002 were also \nreviewed in order to assess the changes in agricultural lands that have occurred within a 5-year \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-27 \nperiod. It should be noted that agricultural census data are available only on a county basis, so \nthe county information given cannot be compared directly with watershed boundaries. \nAccording to Census of Agriculture data, the total amount of land in farms in counties \nlocated within the Ross Barnett watershed has increased between the years 2002 and 2007. Land \nin farms consists of agricultural land used for crops, pasture, or grazing as well as woodland that \nis not used for cultivation or grazing it is considered part of the operations of a farm owner. In \nthe 11 counties within the watershed, the increase in total land in farms ranged from 11% \nto 16%. However the increase in land in farms may be due to an increase in the area categorized \nas total woodland. Total woodland includes natural and planted woodlots or timber tracts, \ncutover and deforested land with young growth. The area of farms categorized as total woodland \nhas shown an increase ranging from 15% to 56% in the counties within the watershed. The \nacreage used for crops and pasture has either decreased or shown an increase nominal to the \npercent of land in farms increase.  \nDominant crops in the four counties located closest to the Reservoir are shown in \nTable H.8. In Rankin County, cotton production has decreased significantly and there has been \nan increase in the number of acres of soybeans. Similarly, there has also been an increase in \nsoybean production in Madison County and a decrease in other crops including hay, cotton, and \nwheat. Landuse data from the NASS Cropland Data layer in 2008 indicates the locations where \nparticular crops are grown within the 1x:10x watershed (Figure H.8). \n \nTable H.8.

Only Rankin and Scott counties are included in Table H.9 because they are the only \ncounties with a discernable amount of agricultural crop areas in the watershed. Rankin and Scott \ncounties have experienced decreases in total cropland of 4% and 17%, respectively. The total \ncropland category includes all harvested cropland as well as cropland used only for pasture and \ngrazing and land where crops were planted but not harvested.  \n \nTable H.9.

In the four counties closest to the \nReservoir (Madison, Rankin, Leake, and Scott), the land areas treated are less than 10% of \ncounty areas. \nAnimal manures are a potential source of nutrients in streams in the watershed, due to the \nnumber of poultry-growing and other animal operations in the area. Scott County is among the \ncounties with highest concentration of poultry growing facilities in the state (personal \ncommunication, Kurt Readus, March 19, 2010). Information available from the Census of \nAgriculture can be used to estimate the current number of farms with agricultural operations \ninvolving animals. The number of farms is available on a county basis (Table H.10). Table H.11 \nshows the percent change in farm types from 2002 to 2007 for the four counties closest to the \nReservoir. In most cases, the number of farms has decreased from 2002 to 2007. The exception \nto this is the number of swine farms in Scott and Rankin counties. The significant increase in the \nnumber of swine farms in Scott County (233%) does not necessarily indicate an increase in the \nnumber of animals. This is because NASS does not track the number of animals on each farm. \n \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-30 \nTable H.10.

Poultry litter is typically applied to pasture land at appropriate times in order to \nsupplement nitrogen needs. NRCS recommends applying poultry litter only after testing has been \nconducted to determine the nutrient content in the litter. When these recommendations are not \nfollowed, poultry litter can be a significant source of excess nutrients and pathogens. \nNRCS provides cost-sharing assistance to businesses that transport poultry litter through \ntheir poultry litter distribution program. The decision to use or sell litter is often based on current \nmarket and the profitability selling fertilizer after transportation costs. Currently, the price of \ncommercial fertilizers is high and many farmers are able to sell litter to other areas. In Scott and \nNewton counties, for example, about half the litter is applied to land within the area where it is \ngenerated. The remaining litter is transported and sold to other areas outside of the county \n(personal communication, Joe Addy, District Conservationist for Scott County, March 22, 2010). \nApproximately 19% of the land in the Ross Barnett watershed is classified as \npasture/grassland based on the NASS landuse data for 2008 (see Figure H.3). As noted \npreviously, poultry litter applied to pasture can be a potential source of nutrients. Pasture can \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-31 \nalso be a source of nutrient loads to surface waters through cattle use of streams (depositing \nmanure in streams), manure deposited on pasture land, and fertilizers applied to pastures.  \nThe amount of cropland used for pasture or grazing is given on a county basis in the \nCensus of Agriculture. The number of acres for the four counties closest to the Reservoir are \ngiven below. The areas given in Table H.12 are based on county boundaries, not watershed \nboundaries. \n \nTable H.12.

Pelahatchie Creek, Fannegusha Creek, and Coffee Bogue are of particular \nconcern because these streams drain directly to the Reservoir. \nRecreational users of the Reservoir commonly swim, water ski, and fish from boats in the \nmain lake, near the dam, in Pelahatchie Bay, and along Roses Bluff (near the shoreline in \nMadison County). There are several locations where public access to swimming areas is allowed. \nThese include public parks in Rankin County (Pelahatchie Shore Park, Lakeshore Park) and \nMadison County (Old Trace Park and Brown’s Landing). It is important to prevent bacterial \ncontamination in these areas to protect public health. Boaters also swim near sand bars upstream \nof Ratliff Ferry. Areas with residential developments that are not served by a central sewer \nsystem also have a higher potential for pathogen issues in nearby waters. These areas are \nprimarily located along the eastern shoreline of the Reservoir and north of Pelahatchie Bay. \n \n3.2      Pathogen      Sources      \nStormwater management plans developed for Rankin County, Madison County, and the \ncities of Flowood, Madison, and Ridgeland have provisions to conduct surveys of the stormwater \nconveyances in their areas to detect potential illicit discharges. These are typically conducted \nduring dry weather. At this time, these programs have not identified any illicit discharges that are \npathogen sources. \nThere are two NPDES-permitted point sources in the watershed that are currently under \nan agreement to install disinfection systems. These facilities are Noxapater POTW South \n(MS0021628) and Noxapater POTW North (MS0025241). These facilities are permitted to \ndischarge treated effluent into Gum Branch and Talladega Creek. Installation of disinfection \nsystems is expected to reduce bacteria in the receiving streams (personal communication, Rusty \nLyons, MDEQ, May 2010). \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-33 \n4.0 PESTICIDES \n \nThe types of pesticides present in the Reservoir watershed can be categorized by their \nintended use. The uses of the pesticides most commonly sold in central Mississippi (per the \nMississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce) are described in Table H.13. Pesticides \napplied to land surfaces draining to the Reservoir have the potential to reach the Reservoir during \nrain events, especially from developed areas located closest to the Reservoir. This includes \npesticides used near homes and other buildings and pest and weed control chemicals used in \nlandscaped areas.  \n \nTable H.13. Intended uses of common pesticide chemicals. \n \nApplication Chemicals \nPest control industry (termite treatments \nto homes) \nPyrethroids (i.e., cypermethrin), Bifenthrin, Fipronil \nLawns (herbicides and insecticides \napplied to lawns by homeowners/ \nbusinesses or companies hired by them)\nMSMA (monosodium methanearsonate), no additional \nproduct will be sold with a turf label after \nDecember 31, 2010; Pendimethalin; Atrazine; 2,4-D; \nGlyphosate; Dicamba; Malathion; Carbaryl; Bifenthrin\nMosquito control done in cities/countiesPermethrin; Resmethrin \nAgricultural areas \nGlyphosate; 2,4-D; Acephate; Dicrotophos; \nFlumioxazin \nForest areas Glyphosate; Imazapyr; Metasulfuron methyl \n \nPesticides applied to landscaped areas near the Reservoir shoreline are an important \nsource to consider. On a national scale, EPA calculates approximately70 million pounds of \nactive pesticide constituents are applied to lawns each year. Pesticides can leave the surface area \nof the lawn by several different means such as; runoff, leaching into groundwater or by \nvolatizing into the air. Pesticides that are applied to turf areas have some runoff, but usually the \nhighest level is during significant storm events and usually if pesticide has been applied recently. \nLeaching into the groundwater is another way that the pesticide can be moved through a \nwatershed. Leaching occurs when a soluble pesticide moves through the soil into the watershed. \nGenerally only trace amounts are lost to groundwater.  \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-34 \nPesticides that are allowed to reach impervious surfaces are quickly washed into the \nwatershed by rain events. Lastly, pesticides can be allowed in the watershed by improper \ndisposal and applicator cleaning. Many homeowners wash applicators on grass, sidewalks or \ndirectly into gutter or storm drains (Schueler 1995). \n\nAppendix H  \nPollutant Source Inventory and Locations of Concern October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nH-35 \n5.0 REFERENCES \n \nBachmann, R.W., M.V.

Fetch is a \nfunction of wind direction relative to the lake shore. Fetch, wind speed, and water depth are used \nto calculate wave period, wave length, and wave height. Wave period, wave length, and wave \nheight are then used to calculate the “maximum bottom boundary velocity”, which is used to \ncalculate the bottom shear stress (Laenen and LeTourneau 1996). \nIn general, sediment resuspension due to wave action is most likely when water depth is \nless than half of the wave length (Carper and Bachman 1984). Bachman et al. (2000) and Carper \nand Bachman (1984) solved wave equations to determine the minimum wind velocity that would \nresult in a wave length greater than two times the water depth for multiple locations within lakes \nand for 36 wind directions. They were able to compare these results to historical wind data from \nnearby weather stations to get an idea of the frequency of sediment resuspension at specific \nlocations within the lakes. \n \n\nAppendix I  \nAnalysis of Wind/Wave Effects on Ross Barnett Reservoir October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nI-2 \n2.0 DETERMINING FETCH \n \nA program has been developed to calculate effective fetch for the surface area of \nMississippi River pools using Geographical Information System (GIS) data (Rogala 1997). The \nmost effective method used the raster-based Global Resource Information Database (GRID) \nmodule to divide the pool surface into 20-meter cells and calculate effective fetch for each cell. \nThe program requires a significant amount of time to perform the calculations; running the \ncalculation for one pool for one wind direction took approximately 5 hours. \n \n\nAppendix I  \nAnalysis of Wind/Wave Effects on Ross Barnett Reservoir October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nI-3 \n3.0 INDICES \n \nHakanson (1982) developed an indicator called the dynamic ratio, calculated by taking \nthe square root of the lake surface area in square kilometers and dividing that by the average lake \ndepth in meters. Bachmann et al. (2000) found the dynamic ratio to be well-correlated to bottom \nsediment disturbance frequency. They found that in lakes with dynamic ratios of 0.8 or higher, \nalmost the entire lake bottom can be subject to sediment resuspension due to wave action. They \nconcluded that these lakes would be most likely to have problems with sediment resuspension. \nThe dynamic ratio for the Ross Barnett Reservoir is greater than 3.\n \nHakanson (1982) also developed an equation for estimating the percentage of a lake bed \nlikely to be subject to erosion process and sediment transport, including those resulting from \nwave action. He termed this value the “areal erosion estimate.” Areal erosion has been calculated \nto be 75.7% for the Ross Barnett Reservoir. \n \n\nAppendix I  \nAnalysis of Wind/Wave Effects on Ross Barnett Reservoir October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nI-4 \n4.0 ESTIMATING AMOUNT OF SUSPENDED MATERIAL \n \nSheng and Lick (1979) developed empirical relationships between shear stress and \nsuspended sediment for shallow areas of Lake Erie. Laenen and LeTourneau (1996) used these \nempirical equations to estimate probable suspended sediment concentrations in Upper Klamath \nBasin in Oregon. \nA study of sediment resuspension in seven shallow lakes in New Zealand (Hamilton and \nMitchell 1996) found bottom shear stress to be a better predictor of suspended solids \nconcentrations than equations using wind speed, wave height, water depth, and wave length. \nIncluding measures of the sediment settling velocity and macrophyte biomass improved the \nregression relationship. \n \n\nAppendix I  \nAnalysis of Wind/Wave Effects on Ross Barnett Reservoir October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nI-5 \n5.0 ROSS BARNETT RESERVOIR \n \nThe dynamic ratio and estimate of areal erosion indicate that Ross Barnett Reservoir will \nbe affected by resuspension of sediments from wave action. \nOne element of wave sediment resuspension to consider is wind direction and speed. \nFigure I.1 shows a wind rose developed from data from the weather station at the Jackson airport \n(located east of the dam). This wind rose indicates that at the airport, wind blows most frequently \nfrom the south to southeast (approximately 26% of the time) and from the north to \nnorth-northwest (approximately 14% of the time). The long axis of Ross Barnett Reservoir runs \nprimarily from southwest to northeast (Figure I.2), which is nearly perpendicular to the \nprevailing winds. Winds parallel to the long axis of the Reservoir (south-southwest to \nwest-southwest and north-northeast to east-northeast) occur approximately 25% of the time \n(Figure I.1). Winds blowing parallel to the long axis of the Reservoir have longer fetch, and can \nbuild larger waves that would be more likely to resuspend sediments. Monthly wind roses for the \nJackson airport (provided in Attachment I.1) indicate that these winds occur most frequently \nduring the summer months. \n \n\n \n \n \nI-6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure I.1.

Therefore, establishment and maintenance of submersed aquatic plants is \nan option for reducing turbidity in shallow systems where wind and wave action contribute \nsignificantly to the turbid conditions (James et al. 2001a). Studies have shown that both \nmeadow-forming submersed aquatic plants, such as Chara and Vallisneria species, and \ncanopy-forming submersed aquatic plants, such as Nympha species, can significantly reduce \nsediment resuspension (Van den Berg et al. 1998, James et al. 2001b). James et al. (2001b) \nsuggest that establishing meadow-forming aquatic plants can stabilize sediments with minimal \ninterference with boating and other open-water recreation.  \nOsmon (2008) identifies promotion of aquatic plant growth as the essential task of a \ncomprehensive strategy to make turbid, shallow lakes clearer through biomanipulation. The \nbenefits of aquatic plants include stabilization of sediments, competition with algae (which \ncontribute to turbidity) for nutrients, providing refuge for zooplankton (which feed on algae), and \nencouraging predatory fish populations (including sport fish). Potential elements of a shallow \nlake turbidity management program include: \n \n• Water level management to encourage aquatic plant growth, \n• Developing “no wake” zones to reduce waves from boating activities that \nresuspend sediment, \n• Establishing breakwater areas to reduce fetch length, \n• Naturalizing shorelines to absorb wave energy, \n• Controlling external nutrient loading, \n• Stocking of predatory fish species, and \n• Removing carp, which resuspend sediment during feeding (Osmon 2008). \n \n \n\nAppendix I  \nAnalysis of Wind/Wave Effects on Ross Barnett Reservoir October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nI-9 \n7.0 REFERENCES \n \nBachmann, R.W., M.V.

The model performs water and nutrient \nbalance calculations in a steady-state, spatially segmented hydraulic network that accounts for \nadvective and diffusive transport, and nutrient sedimentation. BATHTUB utilizes empirical \nmodels of reservoir nutrient balance and eutrophic response to predict reservoir water quality \n(Walker 1987). Required model inputs include annual average inflows and outflows, with annual \naverage phosphorus concentrations, and reservoir water quality profiles, Secchi depths, and \nchlorophyll-a concentrations. Nitrogen data can also be incorporated into the model. The purpose \nfor this modeling effort is to evaluate reservoir productivity responses to changes in nutrient and \nsediment inputs. \n \n\nAppendix J  \nBATHTUB Model Status Report October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nJ-2 \n2.0 MODEL CONFIGURATION \n \n2.1      Geometry      \nThe Ross Barnett Reservoir was represented in the model using segmented geometry, as \nshown on Figure J.1. Each segment was described in the model using the surface area, length, \nand average depth dimensions. In addition, the mixed layer depth and hypolimnetic depth of each \nreservoir segment was specified, as well as the downstream segment. Model inputs are \nsummarized in Table J.1. Surface area was measured from the reservoir extent when the water \nlevel was at the normal pool elevation of 90.5 meters (297 ft). Segment lengths were measured as \nstraight-line distances, rather than along the thalweg. Mean depth was calculated by dividing \nestimated segment volume by the segment surface area. To estimate segment volumes, the \nproportion of volume in each segment was estimated based on data from the 2007 depth survey \nof the Reservoir performed by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks; then \nthis proportion was multiplied by the volume from the Reservoir elevation-capacity curve for \nelevation 90.5 meters (297 ft) (Lester and Harza Engineering 1959). Note that the mixed layer \ndepths\n1\n are currently all set to the mean depth. No value has been specified for the hypolimnetic \ndepth. These values have not yet been determined from the available water quality profile data \nfor the Reservoir. \n                                                \n \n1\n Mixed layer depth is defined as the depth at which light penetration is 1% of light on the water surface. \n\n \n \n \nJ-3 \n \n \n \n#4 \n \n \n#3 \n \n \n#1 \n \n#5 \nPelahatchie Creek \nPearl River + \nFannegusha Creek \nDam  \nReleases \nHwy 43 Bridge \n(#2) \nPelahatchie Bay \nCauseway \n(#6) \nFigure J.1.

For each inflow, the drainage area and annual flow are specified. The model inputs for the \ninflows are shown in Table J.2. Annual flow for the Pearl River was estimated based on annual \nflows reported at US Geological Survey (USGS) gages on the Pearl and Yockanookany Rivers. \nThe average of the annual flows over the period of record at each gage was divided by the \ndrainage area for the gage to calculate the flow per area: 0.015 cubic meters per second (cms) per \nsquare kilometer for Pearl River at Edinburgh, 0.013 cms/km\n2\n for Pearl River at Lena, and \n0.006 cms/km\n2\n for Yockanookany River at Revive. Based on these values, a flow per area of \n0.014 cms/km\n2\n was selected to estimate the inflows. Annual flow for the Pearl River was \nestimated by multiplying 0.014 cms/km\n2\n by the upstream drainage area of the headwaters. Since \nrecent flow data were not available for Pelahatchie Creek (the current Pelahatchie Creek gage \nmeasures stage only), the Pearl River flow per area was also used to estimate annual flow into \nPelahatchie Bay. Therefore, Pelahatchie Creek annual flow was estimated by multiplying the \ndrainage area to Pelahatchie Bay by 0.014 cms/km\n2\n. \n \nTable J.2.

The average annual outflow \nwas calculated from the midnight readings from the spillway logs for the period from 1979 \nthrough 2004, approximately 4,300 cubic feet per second (cfs) (3,840 cubic hm/yr). \n \n2.4 Observed Reservoir Water Quality \nObserved Reservoir water quality data are input with the Reservoir geometry. Data were \nselected from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) reservoir \nmonitoring program at Ross Barnett from 1997 through 2004 to calibrate the model. A \nspreadsheet was used to calculate average total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll-a, Secchi \ndepth, and organic nitrogen. The input values for each segment are shown in Table J.3. \nNon-algal turbidity was calculated from Secchi depth and chlorophyll-a using the following \nequation (Walker 1987): \n \nNon-algal turbidity = (1/Secchi) – (0.25*chlorophyll-a)  \n \nOrthophosphorus can also be input to the model, but these data were not available. Since \nthere is no water quality monitoring station on the Pelahatchie causeway, observed water quality \ndata for Segment 6 were set to the values used in Segment 5. \n \nTable J.3.

For the initial model run, inflow water quality \nconcentrations were set to the concentrations observed in the upstream Reservoir segment \n(i.e., headwaters/Pearl River inflow water quality was set to observed water quality in \nSegment 1, and Pelahatchie Bay inflow water quality was set to observed water quality for \nSegment 5). \n \nTable J.4.

After evaluating several model options, the second order available phosphorus \nmodel gave the best results for the phosphorus balance (Walker 1987). An additional phosphorus \nbalance model from Higgins and Kim (1981) was examined. \nRegardless of the choice for the phosphorus balance model, the model estimated \nphosphorus concentrations in the inflow segments (1 and 5) that were much lower than observed. \nThis may have been due to low inflow concentrations of phosphorous. To compensate for this, \nthe inflow phosphorus concentrations were arbitrarily increased until the modeled phosphorus \nconcentrations in the inflow segments were similar to the observed Reservoir total phosphorus \nconcentrations. Using this backwards method, the Pearl River total phosphorus concentration at \nthe inflow would need to be around 200 ppb, and that the Pelahatchie Bay inflow concentration \nwould need to be around 2,000 ppb. Based on this finding, the water quality data for the Ross \nBarnett tributaries were reexamined. \nInitially, total phosphorus concentrations in the inflow were based on data for the Pearl \nRiver at Edinburgh, and the Yockanookany River at Revive. This is because these monitoring \nstations accounted for two of the largest tributary watersheds. Data from these sites have been \nanalyzed in detail in Appendix C of the Comprehensive Watershed Protection and Restoration \nPlan. Total phosphorus concentrations at the Pearl River monitoring site averaged 100 ppb, and \nat the Yockanookany site they averaged 98 ppb. Since this was only about half the Pearl River \ninflow concentration needed to match the Reservoir total phosphorus concentration, water \nquality data from other tributary watersheds were reviewed. The one total phosphorus \nmeasurement available from Fannegusha Creek was 140 ppb, which is less than 200 ppb. \nHowever, when data from Tuscolameta Creek were reviewed, total phosphorus concentrations \nranged from 360 ppb to 1,270 ppb. Given these high total phosphorus concentrations, it is \npossible that the average total phosphorus concentration of the Pearl River at the headwaters \ncould be in the range of 200 ppb. \n\nAppendix J  \nBATHTUB Model Status Report October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nJ-12 \nTotal phosphorus data from special studies of Pelahatchie Creek are available. These data \nindicate that total phosphorus concentrations in lower Pelahatchie Creek tend to be around \n200 ppb. This is an order of magnitude less than the concentration suggested by the modeling \nexercise. However, a few samples collected as part of a special study during low-flow, \nhigh-temperature conditions indicated total phosphorus concentrations as high as 1,200 ppb \nbelow a municipal wastewater facility's discharge point. At this point, \n\nit cannot be confirmed that \ntotal phosphorus concentrations in Pelahatchie Bay inflows average around 2,000 ppb. Internal \nloading of total phosphorus from sediments within Pelahatchie Bay may account for the \nadditional phosphorous load. \n \n4.2      Chlorophyll-a \nCalibration for the chlorophyll-a model was attempted next. Because algae growth in the \nReservoir is light-limited, a chlorophyll-a model that considers non-algal turbidity would be \nmost appropriate. However, neither of the BATHTUB models that use non-algal turbidity \nprovided results similar to the observed chlorophyll-a. Based on examination of the \nchlorophyll-a models and their inputs to determine why the model results are so disparate, it \nappears that the BATHTUB chlorophyll-a models are not applicable to a light-limited system \nlike the Ross Barnett Reservoir. It is possible that BATHTUB will not be useful for estimating \nchanges in Ross Barnett Reservoir water quality until sediment inputs are reduced and water \nclarity improves. \n \n\nAppendix J  \nBATHTUB Model Status Report October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nJ-13 \n5.0 CONCLUSIONS \n \nThere are several issues associated with the modeling effort to date. First, it is apparent \nthat the measured water quality data necessary to adequately characterize nutrient inputs to the \nReservoir are not available. Second, it is unclear whether BATHTUB will be able to provide \nuseful insight into potential changes in Ross Barnett Reservoir water quality when nutrient and \nsediment inputs to the Reservoir are reduced through watershed management. \n \n\nAppendix J  \nBATHTUB Model Status Report October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nJ-14 \n6.0 REFERENCES \n \nCanfield, D.E., and R.W.

For clarity, the characteristics \nare repeated below in Table K.1. This appendix explains how data for each of the characteristics \nwere analyzed to develop a ranking system for HUC12 watersheds.  \n \nTable K.1. Prioritization characteristics for restoration. \n \nIssue Characteristic \nSediment \n• Percent developed areas by HUC12 \n• Percent of total waters with sediment total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) \n• Slope \n• Permitted sources most likely to contribute sediment (construction \nstormwater permits and surface mining permits) \n• Percent area with crop land use \nNutrients and \nPesticides \n• Percent of total waters with nutrient TMDLs \n• Percent area with crop and urban land uses \n• Percent areas with pasture land use \n• Permitted sources most likely to contribute nutrients (animal growing \noperations and wastewater treatment facilities) \nPathogens \n• Percent of total waters with pathogen TMDLs \n• Percent areas with pasture and urban landuse \n• Permitted sources most likely to contribute pathogens (animal growing \noperations and wastewater treatment facilities ) \nAquatic \nWeeds \n• Treatment locations \n• Locations identified during aquatic plant surveys \nTrash \n• Stakeholder-identified areas of concern  \n \nCriteria were developed for each characteristic to classify the HUC12s as having “high,” \n“medium,” or “low” restoration priority. These criteria were based on analysis of the values of \nthe characteristics for all of the HUC12s. For example, the percent developed area was calculated \nfor each HUC12. Developed area was used as a surrogate for impervious area. Values of percent \ndeveloped area ranged from 2.8% to 25.6%. A plot of the cumulative distribution for developed \narea was created and visually inspected for “break points” in the values. Break points were \n\nAppendix K  \nPrioritization of HUC12 Watersheds for Protection and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nK-2 \nassigned at points on the cumulative distribution that showed a visible change in slope \n(Figure K.1). Break points for the criteria were also compared to known literature values for the \nexpected effect of watershed characteristics on downstream water quality. Impervious surface \narea is known to have some effect on channel condition and loads of sediment and other \nnonpoint source pollutants at 5% and a much greater effect at 10% (D’Ambrosio et al. 2004; \nSchueler 1995).  \nThe prioritization characteristics include potential sources of pollutants due to both \nnonpoint sources and point sources. Waters for which TMDLs have been developed for \nsediment, nutrients, and pathogens indicate areas with recognized pollutant issues. Watersheds \nwith a higher percent of developed area, higher slopes, and land uses that are indicative of land \nmodification and anthropogenic activities have a greater potential for pollutants to be generated \nin the watershed and contributed to nearby waters. The characteristics that refer to point sources \n(i.e., sources likely to contribute to sediment, nutrients, and pathogens) are subject to regulatory \nprograms described in Appendix F of the Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan. \n \n1.1      Sediment      \nAs shown in Table K.1, the characteristics used to prioritize HUC12s for sediment issues \nare 1) percent impervious cover, 2) percent streams with TMDLs, 3) slope, 4) construction and \nmining permits, and 5) percent crop land use. The criteria for classifying the sediment \nprioritization characteristics are summarized in Tables K.2 and K.3. The percent developed area \ncharacteristic was described in Section 1.0. The remaining characteristics are discussed in this \nsection. \n \n\n \n \n \nK-3 \nFigure K.1.

Length of all stream reaches was calculated using the National \nHydrography Dataset (NHD) for medium resolution streams. The NHD includes a total of \n1,954 miles of stream in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. Sediment TMDLs have been \ndeveloped for 395 miles of stream in the watershed. The criteria shown in Tables K.2 and K.3 for \nclassifying the HUC12s were set based on the cumulative distribution of percent streams with \nsediment TMDLs. More stringent criteria for developed area was used for HUC12s in the 1x:10x \nwatershed. The cumulative distribution plot for sediment TMDLs is shown on Figure K.2. \n\n \n \n \nK-5 \nFigure K.2. Cumulative distribution for sediment TMDLs. \n \n \n \n \n\nAppendix K  \nPrioritization of HUC12 Watersheds for Protection and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nK-6 \nSlope classes defined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) were used \nto characterize slopes in each HUC12. Table K.4 includes the NRCS terms for both simple and \ncomplex slopes. For prioritization, areas with the NRCS simple slope classifications of “nearly \nlevel” or “gently sloping” were classified as “low slopes;” areas with the NRCS simple slope \nclassifications of “strongly sloping” to “moderately steep” were classified as “medium slopes;” \nand areas with the NRCS simple slope classification of “steep to very steep” were classified as \n“high slopes.” Complex slopes are groups of slopes that have definite breaks in several different \ndirections and in most cases markedly different slope gradients within the areas delineated. Slope \ncomplexity has an important influence on the amount and rate of runoff and on sedimentation \nassociated with runoff.  \nThe percentages of each HUC12 categorized as medium slopes and high slopes were \nplotted as cumulative distributions (Figures K.3 and K.4, respectively). Break points for \nprioritization based on percent high slopes and percent medium slopes were set based on these \ndistributions. The classifications for medium and high slopes were then combined into one \nprioritization factor. For the combined slope factor, all HUC12s with an overall high priority for \nhigh slopes were given a high priority. In addition, all HUC12s where either the high or the \nmedium slope had an overall high priority and the other had an overall medium priority were \nalso assigned a high priority. All HUC12s with a low priority for both medium and high slopes \nwere given a low priority. The remaining HUC12s were given a medium priority.  \n \nTable K.4.

The locations of permitted construction and mining stormwater \ndischarges were obtained from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). \nThe coverage of construction stormwater permits was restricted to only sites covered under the \nlarge construction stormwater permit, which applies to construction activities that \n\ndisturb 5 acres \nor greater. Each HUC12 was assigned a rating of “high” if any construction or mining \nstormwater permits were present in the HUC12 and “low” if there were none. \n \n1.1.3   Crop Land Use \nThe percentage of crop land use in a few HUC12s was as high as 25%; however, the \nmajority of HUC12s contain less than 1%. The criteria for prioritization based on percent crop \nland use were determined from the cumulative distribution of percentages for each HUC12 \n(Figure K.5). \n \n1.1.4   Overall   Sediment   Restoration Priority \nThe priority watersheds for sediment were identified based on the ratings for five \ncharacteristics. Results are shown on Figure K.6. HUC12s with two characteristics rated as high \npriority were assigned an overall high priority. This resulted in nine first-tier priority HUC12s \n(highlighted in red on Figure K.6). The TMDL rating was reviewed with a change in the high \nbreak point. When the breakpoint was reduced to 50%, four additional second-tier HUC12s were \nprioritized (highlighted in yellow on Figure K.6). High priority was assigned to 13 out of \n87 HUC12s (11%). \n \n\n \n \n \nK-10 \nFigure K.5. Cumulative distribution for percent crop land use. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nK-11 \nFigure K.6.

The criteria for \nclassifying the nutrient/pesticide prioritization characteristics are summarized in Tables K.5 \nand K.6. \n \nTable K.5.

Nutrient TMDLs have been developed for 257 miles of stream. The criteria shown in \nTables K.5 and K.6 for classifying the HUC12s were set based on the cumulative distribution of \npercent streams with nutrient TMDLs. \n\nAppendix K  \nPrioritization of HUC12 Watersheds for Protection and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nK-13 \n1.2.2   Urban, Crop, and Pasture Land Uses \nSeveral types of land uses were considered in the prioritization for nutrients and \npesticides. These include urban land use, crop land use, and pasture land use. Urban area \naccounts for a small percentage of most HUC12s and tends to be concentrated in areas near the \nReservoir and several municipalities in the upper watershed. As previously discussed, crop land \nis a small percentage of most HUC12s. Pasture land accounts for approximately 14% of the \nReservoir drainage area, and ranges from 6% to 36% in individual HUC12s.  \nUrban lands and crop lands were considered together. The criteria for prioritization based \non percent urban and crop lands were determined from the cumulative distribution of \npercentages for each HUC12 (Figure K.7). \nPasture land was considered separately so that its relationship with the presence of animal \noperations that apply poultry litter to pasture land could be evaluated. The cumulative \ndistribution for pasture land showed a single inflection point at approximately 14%, and high and \nlow ratings were assigned based on this value (Figure K.8). \n \n1.2.3   Permitted   Nutrient   Sources   \nPermitted sources likely to contribute nutrients include wastewater treatment facilities \nand animal growing operations. These two types of permits were considered separately for \nprioritization. The locations of permitted wastewater treatment facilities were obtained from \nMDEQ. Facilities included are those that treat domestic and industrial wastewater prior to \ndischarge using technologies such conventional lagoons, aerated lagoons, and activated sludge. \nAll of these facilities have specific permit limits for organic material. Some facilities also have \nmonitoring requirements for nutrients (typically total nitrogen and total phosphorous). All of \nthese facilities are considered potential nutrient contributors.  \n\n \n \n \nK-14 \nFigure K.7. Cumulative distribution for percent crop and urban land uses. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nK-15 \nFigure K.8. Cumulative distribution for percent pasture land use. \n \n \n \n\nAppendix K  \nPrioritization of HUC12 Watersheds for Protection and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nK-16 \nIn the 1x:10x watershed, ratings for wastewater treatment facilities were assigned as \n“high” if one or more facilities were present in each HUC12 and “low” if no facilities were \npresent. In the remainder of the watershed, ratings for the wastewater treatment facilities were \nassigned as “high” if three or more facilities were present in each HUC12, “medium” if two \nfacilities were present, and “low” if there was one or none. Facility size (permitted flow and \neffluent limits for organic material) was not considered in the prioritization.  \nThe Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed contains numerous permitted animal growing \noperations for poultry and swine operations, with the majority being poultry. Records obtained \nfrom MDEQ contain locations of permits for confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and \nlocations of state operating permits for animal feeding operations (AFOs). There are six CAFO \npermits in the watershed for swine operations. These facilities have lagoons and land application \nareas to treat and dispose of wastewater. Poultry operations that serve fewer than 1,000 animal \nunits and utilize dry litter disposal are required to submit a Notice of Intent to MDEQ for \ncoverage under a multimedia discharge general permit. There are 326 sites in the Ross Barnett \nReservoir watershed covered by the AFO dry litter multimedia discharge general permit as of \nAugust 2010. The number of CAFO and AFO facilities in each HUC12 was determined based on \nthe current permit locations. Ratings for the animal growing operations were assigned as “high” \nif 12 or more facilities were present in each HUC12, “medium” if 5 to 11 facilities were present, \nand “low” if less than five were present. Figure K.9 shows the frequency distribution curve for \nnumber of CAFO/AFO facilities. \n \n1.2.4   Overall Nutrient Priority \nThe priority watersheds for nutrients/pesticides were identified based on the ratings for \nfive characteristics. Results are shown on Figure K.10. HUC12s with two characteristics rated as \nhigh priority were assigned an overall high priority. A high-priority rating was assigned to 20 out \nof 87 HUC12s (23%). \n \n\n \n \n \nK-17 \nFigure K.9. Frequency distribution curve for number of CAFOs/AFOs. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nK-18 \nFigure K.10.

The criteria for classifying the pathogen \nprioritization characteristics are summarized in Tables K.7 and K.8. \n \nTable K.7.

Pathogen TMDLs have been developed for 279 miles of stream. The criteria shown \nin Tables K.7 and K.8 for classifying the HUC12s were set based on the cumulative distribution \nof percent streams with pathogen TMDLs. \n\nAppendix K  \nPrioritization of HUC12 Watersheds for Protection and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nK-20 \n1.3.2   Pasture and Urban Land Uses \nPasture and urban land uses were considered in the prioritization for pathogens. Pasture \nlands are typically used for grazing animals (i.e., cattle, horses, and other animals). Grazing \nanimals may deposit manure near streams and within streams when fencing is not in place. As \npreviously discussed, litter from poultry operations is also routinely applied to pasture lands. \nAlthough nutrient management plans limit the application of litter near stream buffer zones and \nprior to storm events, litter remains a potential pathogen source during wet-weather conditions.  \nUrban areas contain sources such as pet waste and failing septic systems. The criteria for \nprioritization based on percent pasture land and urban land were determined from the cumulative \ndistribution of percentages for each HUC12 (Figure K.11). As shown in Table K.7, more \nstringent criteria were used for the 1x:10x watershed because pathogens originating in these \nwatersheds have less travel time prior to reaching the Reservoir. \n \n1.3.3   Permitted   Pathogen   Sources   \nPermitted sources likely to contribute pathogens to nearby streams include wastewater \ntreatment facilities and animal feeding operations. HUC12 watersheds were rated as “low,” \n“medium,” and “high” using the same method for nutrient sources described in Section 1.2.3. \n \n1.3.4   Overall Pathogen Priority \nThe priority watersheds for pathogens were identified based on the ratings for four \ncharacteristics. Results are shown on Figure K.12. HUC12s with two characteristics rated as high \npriority were assigned an overall high priority. This resulted in five first-tier high-priority \nHUC12s (highlighted in red on Figure K.12). Because only five HUC12s were indicated, the \nmedium ratings were reviewed. HUC12s with two characteristics rated as medium and one \ncharacteristic rated as high were also considered high priority. With this modification, \n17 additional second-tier HUC12s were prioritized (highlighted in yellow on Figure K.12). High \npriority was assigned to 22 out of 87 HUC12s (25%). \n \n\n \n \n \nK-21 \nFigure K.11.

This information indicates that aquatic weeds are currently a concern within the \nthree HUC12 watersheds where the Reservoir is located: HUC12 ID Nos. 0318000020-301, \n0318000020-404, and 0318000020-403. \n \n1.5      Trash      \nThe characteristics used to prioritize HUC12s for trash were limited to specific areas of \nconcern noted by PRVWSD and other stakeholders. These areas are the sandbars located along \nthe section of the Pearl River extending from the upper end of the Reservoir to the Low-Head \nDam (HUC12 ID Nos. 0318000020-403, 0318000020-402, and 0318000020-401). \n \n\nAppendix K  \nPrioritization of HUC12 Watersheds for Protection and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nK-24 \n2.0 PROTECTION \n \nSection 5.0 of the Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan presents the \ncharacteristics used for prioritizing HUC12 watersheds for protection measures. Characteristics \nused for protection prioritization are based on the Mississippi Watershed Characterization and \nRanking Tool (MWCRT). The MWCRT was used to develop resource values for each HUC12. \nThe resource values are based on features that affect the human welfare and environmental \nwellbeing of areas of the state (Storelli 2006). A resource, within the scope of this tool, is defined \nas an environmental parameter that is considered to be beneficial and worthy of protection. \n \n2.1 Human Welfare Protection \nThe MWCRT assigns a score for the presence of features that affect human welfare. \nScores depend on the perceived importance of each feature to human welfare. Detailed \ninformation about the methods used to develop the scores is given in Storelli (2006). Features \nthat affect human welfare are listed below. The MWCRT scores for human welfare are shown on \nFigure K.13. HUC12s with a score greater than 1.4 were considered “high value” for human \nwelfare. Features that were considered to affect human welfare are as follows: \n \n• Public waterways, \n• Drinking water supply, \n○ Water supply intakes. \n○ Source Water Protection Areas. \n• Water quality standards for recreation (streams), \n• Water quality standards for recreation (lakes), \n• Recreational locations, \n• State parks, and \n• National parks. \n\n \n \n \nK-25 \nFigure K.13. MWCRT scores for human welfare. \n \n \n \n\nAppendix K  \nPrioritization of HUC12 Watersheds for Protection and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nK-26 \n2.2      Environmental      Protection      \nThe MWCRT also assigns a score for the presence of features that are considered to \nbenefit the wellbeing of the environment. The loss or corruption of these features would be a \ndetriment and could adversely affect the ecology of the local area. The characteristics for \nenvironmental resources include the presence of the following land uses or attributes. The \nMWCRT scores for environmental resources are shown on Figure K.14. HUC12s with a score \ngreater than 8.8 were considered “high value” for environmental protection. Features considered \nto benefit the wellbeing of the environment are as follows: \n \n• Endangered species, \n• Wetlands, \n• Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs), \n• National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs), \n• National forests, \n• Lakes, and \n• Perennial streams. \n \n\n \n \n \nK-27 \nFigure K.14.

Some have developed management plans that apply to \nthe watershed. In addition, several organizations are leading restoration projects in the Ross \nBarnet Reservoir watershed. The Comprehensive Protection and Restoration Plan has been \ndeveloped with consideration of these management activities and restoration projects. \n \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-2 \n2.0 MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS \n \nOrganizations and resource agencies with resource management responsibilities in the \nRoss Barnett Reservoir and its watershed include the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District \n(PRVWSD), neighborhood associations, developers, the Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality (MDEQ), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, the \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks (MDWFP), the USDA Natural \nResources Conservation Service (NRCS), the Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation \nCommission (MSWCC), the Mississippi Forestry Commission (MFC), the Mississippi Band of \nChoctaw Indians, and the National Park Service. PRVWSD is primarily responsible for \nmanagement of the Reservoir and their property around it. \n \n2.1 Pearl River Valley Water Supply District \nCurrent in-reservoir management practices include dredging, enforcement of boating \nrules/litter collection, shoreline maintenance, and herbicide application for control of aquatic \ninvasive species. In addition, PRVWSD manages approximately 17,000 acres of land around the \nReservoir. PRVWSD oversees developed lands around the Reservoir and manages over \n12,400 acres of timberland around the Reservoir. The PRVWSD forestry management plan is \ndescribed in Section 3.1. \n \n2.1.1   Dredging   \nDredging represents a significant expense and is a result of sediment loads transported to \nthe Reservoir from its tributaries. Annual dredging costs for PRVWSD are approximately \n$500,000. This figure includes fuel, personal costs, and equipment depreciation (personal \ncommunication, PRVWSD, November 2010). PRVWSD uses management practices to \nminimize unintended release of sediment during dredging.  \nLocating appropriate disposal sites for dredging material is a concern. Current disposal \nmethods include 1) upland areas near dredge sites, 2) marginal wetland areas, and 3) in-reservoir \ndisposal to create small islands and wildlife habitat. Disposal in marginal wetland areas is \nintended to improve habitat and create additional opportunity for growth of plant species. The \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-3 \nRoss Barnett Reservoir Monitoring Plan includes recommendations for additional record \nkeeping, monitoring of the amount of sediment removed, and particle size of sediment. Also, the \nmonitoring plan recommends a sediment survey to estimate the volume of sediment in the \nReservoir. \n \n2.1.2   Enforcement of Boating Rules \nPRVWSD maintains the Reservoir Patrol to enforce boating laws. Although the primary \nfunction of the Patrol is to maintain safety, officers monitor for environmental problems such as \nlittering or release of septic tank waste. The officers have the ability to issue citations to boaters \nwho are littering and disposing of septic tank waste improperly if they directly observe these \nactivities. All boats with septic holding tanks must register with PRVWSD and have an annual \ninspection of their holding tanks. No-wake zones are required near boat launches and areas. The \nprimary purpose of no-wake zones is boater safety, but they also reduce waves generated by boat \ntraffic from impacting sensitive shoreline areas. \n \n2.1.3   Shoreline   Maintenance   \nPRVWSD reports that shoreline stabilization is not a significant concern. Currently, no \nareas with eroding shoreline have been identified. PRVWSD manages the Reservoir to have \nminimal elevation changes, which helps protect shorelines from erosion. Except in severe \ndrought conditions, the water level remains between 296 ft and 297.5 ft mean sea level (msl). \nReduced water level fluctuation minimizes the potential for failure of the banks due to \nalternating periods of wet/dry conditions. Structural stabilization measures (rip rap and metal \nbulkheads) have been installed along much of the shoreline to protect it from erosion. \n \n2.1.4   Aquatic Invasive Species Management Program \nPRVWSD currently manages several species of invasive aquatic plants in the Reservoir, \nincluding alligator weed, water hyacinth, and hydrilla. The management program includes annual \nsurveys of the locations of these aquatic plants. Herbicides are applied to targeted areas during \nthe summer growing season to prevent growth and further spread. Costs for herbicide application \nin recent years are summarized in Table M.1. The management program has been successful in \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-4 \nreducing these species in the Reservoir (Wersal et al. 2009). The Geosystems Research Institute \nrecommends continued herbicide application along with intensive surveying and regular \nassessments of invasive species populations. \n \nTable M.1. Cost of aquatic invasive species spraying programs (PRVWSD 2010). \n \nYear Cost \n2007 $202,897 \n2008 $234,550 \n2009 $243,292 \nAs of 09/30/2010 $182,711 \nNote: Cost reflects only contract costs for aquatic spraying programs. Cost does not include PRVWSD personnel that supervise \nthe program; actual costs are considerably higher. \n \n2.2 USDA Forest Service \nThe USDA Forest Service manages two national forests located in the Ross Barnett \nReservoir watershed, the Bienville National Forest and the Tombigbee National Forest. \n \n2.3 Mississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nMDWFP manages the Ross Barnett Reservoir fishery (see Section 3.2 for discussion of \nthe fishery management plan) and several properties in the watershed. These include the Pearl \nRiver Wildlife Management Area, the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area Waterfowl \nRefuge, the Bienville Wildlife Management Area, the Nanih Waiya Wildlife Management Area, \nthe Roosevelt State Park, and the Golden Memorial State Park. \n \n2.4 USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \nUnder the Federal Food Security Act (Farm Bill), initially passed in 1985, all US farm \noperators are required to meet soil erosion control standards specified in the law. Compliance \nwith these standards is a prerequisite for participation in most federal farm programs. Subsequent \namendments to the Farm Bill have added programs that provide incentives to farm operators for \nenhancing water quality through such actions as taking highly erodible lands out of production \nand restoring wetlands. These programs are implemented through NRCS by county. All counties \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-5 \nin the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed are eligible for participation in some or all NRCS \nprograms. \n \n2.5 Mississippi Soil & Water Conservation Commission \nMSWCC was established by the legislature in 1938 after recognizing the need to protect \nthe soil and water resources of the state. Their mission is to effectively guide, promote, and \ndemonstrate the conservation, development, protection, and proper utilization of the soil, wat\n\ner, \nand related resources of Mississippi. MSWCC works in cooperation with NRCS to provide \nassistance to landowners who participate in conservation projects or educational opportunities \nrelated to conservation.  \n \n2.6      Mississippi      Forestry      Commission      \nMFC provides information and assistance to owners of public and private landowners in \nthe state, and has developed a Best Management Practices Handbook (MFC 2008) describing \nrecommended best management practices (BMPs) for forest lands in Mississippi. In addition, the \nMississippi Forestry Commission administers several management programs, including the State \nForest Stewardship Program, Forest Resource Development Program, and Forest Legacy \nProgram. \n \n2.6.1   State Forest Stewardship Program \nThe State Forest Stewardship Program provides assistance to private landowners of \nnonindustrial lands to manage natural resources on forest land to improve water quality, air \nquality, wildlife, and recreational benefits of forest lands. Landowners enrolled in the forest \nstewardship program must meet certain criteria to participate in the program and must develop \nand implement a forest stewardship plan. As of November 2010, there were approximately \n5,800 acres of forest land within the Reservoir watershed enrolled in the Forest Stewardship \nProgram (Figure M.1). \n \n\n \n \n \nM-6 \nFigure M.1. Forest conservation program areas in the Ross Barnett watershed. \n \n \n \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-7 \n2.6.2   Forest Resource Development Program \nThrough Forest Resource Development Program (FRDP), resource development plans \ncan be developed at the request of private landowners. In addition, this program provides \nassistance with tree planting and forest improvement practices for the purpose of long-term \ntimber production. This program facilitates implementation of forestry practices designed to \nproduce timber and enhance wildlife development. Participating landowners agree to protect the \narea receiving FRDP assistance from fire and grazing, and to properly manage the area for a \nminimum of 10 years. As of November 2010, there were approximately 25,121 acres of forest \nland within the Reservoir watershed enrolled in the FRDP. \n \n2.6.3   Forest   Legacy   Program   \nThe Forest Legacy Program (FLP) was established by Congress in 1990 to ascertain and \nprotect environmentally important forest areas. Water supply protection is identified as an \nattribute of one of the four core national criteria used to score and rank FLP projects. MFC \nidentified three Forest Legacy Areas (FLAs) in the state that are experiencing, or previously have \nexperienced, population growth that could result in forest conversion to non-forest use. The \nCentral Mississippi FLA includes the Ross Barnett Reservoir and a significant portion of the \nwatershed that drains to the Reservoir (MFC 2007).  \n \n2.7 Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians \nThe Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is responsible for natural resources \nmanagement on their tribal lands in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. This includes real \nestate transfers, forestry management, and environmental protection. \n \n2.8 National Park Service \nThe National Park Service is responsible for management of the lands associated with the \nNatchez Trace Parkway, which runs through the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed.  \n \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-8 \n3.0 MANAGEMENT PLANS \n \nAdministration of some public lands in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed is led by a \nformal planning process. Management plans that address lands in the watershed are discussed \nbelow. \n \n3.1 PRVWSD Forestry Management Plan \nPRVWSD manages the forest areas in their lease land according to a forestry \nmanagement plan. The current plan was developed for the years 2000 through 2010. A new plan \nis currently in development. The forestry management plan includes detailed descriptions of each \ncompartment of forest land. Management practices are prescribed for each compartment in order \nto maintain healthy forest areas. Timber harvesting is conducted according the management plan \nupon approval from the PRVWSD Board of Directors. \n \n3.2 Ross Barnett Reservoir Fishery Management Plan \nMDWFP maintains a fishery management plan for the Ross Barnett Reservoir. The \nmanagement goal is to promote, conserve and enhance the fisheries resources in Ross Barnett \nReservoir so that fishing is accessible to a majority of the anglers under existing and future \nfishing pressure. \nThe objectives of the fishery management plan are as follows: \n \n1. Control exotic plants to not exceed current levels  \n2. Stay informed of issues within the Pearl River watershed that may be detrimental \nto wildlife and fisheries habitat. \n3. Evaluate the existing minimum length limit (15 inches) on black bass. \n4. Maintain the mean weight of angler harvested crappie at >\n0.6 lbs, and the targeted \nangler catch rate at >1.9 crappie/hour (75\nth\n percentile for reservoirs).  \n5. Maintain the mean “lunker” weight of largemouth bass caught by tournament \nanglers at >\n5 pounds. \n6. Maintain the Ross Barnett tailwater fishery for hybrid striped bass.  \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-9 \n7. Determine fishing effort and harvest of catfish species by hand grabbers in the \nReservoir area south of Highway 43 and Pelahatchie Bay. \n \n3.3 USDA Forest Service Land and Resource Management Plan for National \nForests in Mississippi  \nThe National Forest Management Act requires the development of a Land and Resource \nManagement Plan, a document that sets the broad framework for activities on National Forest \nLands. A broad, strategic direction for managing all National Forest lands within each state is \ndocumented in a statewide Land and Resource Management Plan. The Land and Resource \nManagement Plan addresses the uses and services associated with National Forest lands, \nincluding timber harvesting, mineral extraction, hunting, recreation, range, water quality, fishing, \nand wildlife. This plan is currently being revised. \n \n3.4 Stormwater Management Plans and Ordinances \nCities and counties regulated under the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) \nprogram must develop and implement a stormwater management program. Stormwater \nmanagement programs specify management practices that will be used to address six elements of \nstormwater management: \n \n1. Public education and outreach, \n2. Public participation and involvement, \n3. Illicit discharge detection and elimination, \n4. Construction site stormwater controls, \n5. Post-construction stormwater controls, and \n6. Pollution prevention and good housekeeping. \n \nRegulated entities are required to submit annual reports to MDEQ that summarize actions \ntaken under each of the six elements. All entities in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed are \ncurrently in compliance with MS4 requirements. \nAs a requirement of the MS4 permit, regulated cities and counties must develop and \nenforce stormwater ordinances to regulate development. MDEQ has reviewed and approved the \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-10 \nordinances in effect in Rankin and Madison counties and in the cities of Madison, Flowood, and \nRidgeland as meeting US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) criteria (personal \ncommunication, Jim Morris, MDEQ, December 2010). The applicable ordinances in these areas \ninclude stormwater management and subdivision ordinances. The cities of Madison, Flowood, \nand Ridgeland also have grading and landscape ordinances. The specific design criteria vary for \neach area, but generally require that post-development flows are less than or equal to \npre-development flows generated during specific rain events, typically a 2-year, 24-hour storm. \nThe landscaping ordinances in Madison and Flowood restrict the removal of trees on \ndevelopment sites outside of the building footprint and paved areas. The city of Madison requires \ndevelopers to maintain a 20-ft buffer zone along drainage channels and a 30-ft buffer along \nstream tributaries. \n \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-11 \n4.0 CONSERVATION PLANS \n \nSome conservation activities in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed are led by a formal \nplanning process. Conservation plans that address lands in the watershed are discussed below. \n \n4.1 Mississippi Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy \nThe streams of the Pearl River drainage upstream of Ross Barnett Reservoir were \nidentified as one of the top five high-priority freshwater habitat systems in Mississippi for \nSpecies of Greatest Conservation Need (see Appendix B of the Comprehensive Protection and \nRestoration Plan for discussion of these species) (MDWFP 2005). This system was classified as \nvulnerable to degradation. Priority conservation actions identified for this area include habitat \nrestoration and protection, BMPs to address nonpoint source pollution, prohibiting gravel mining \nin streams, control of exotic species, public education, and landowner incentive and assistance \nprograms.  \nPriority conservation actions are also identified for other habitat systems in the \nwatershed, including reservoirs, artificial ponds, bottomland hardwood forests (which are one of \nthe top five high-priority terrestrial habitat systems in Mississippi), Jackson Prairie, marshes, \nurban and suburban lands, and pine plantations. \n \n4.2 The Nature Conservancy High Priority Conservation Areas \nThe Nature Conservancy has identified several areas in the watershed as high-priority \nconservation areas: North Bienville National Forest, Noxapater Creek, Pearl River, Tallahaga \nCreek, and upper Yockanookany River\n1\n. \n \n \n                                                \n \n1\n http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/mississippi/preserves/art17303.html \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-12 \n5.0 RESTORATION PROJECTS \n \nSeveral restoration projects have been implemented, or are currently being implemented, \nin the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. These projects are described below. \n \n5.1 Jackson Prairie Restoration Project \nThe Nature Conservancy is partnering with the USDA Forest Service to restore 66 acres \nof Jackson Prairie in Bienville National Forest\n2\n. As part of this project, the Nature Conservancy \nwill also partner with Mississippi State University to research management methods, historic \nextent of the Jackson Prairie, and land use in the project area. Restoration will include use of \nherbicides to control woody vegetation. \n \n5.2      Mill      Creek      Restoration Project \nThe Mill Creek watershed encompasses approximately 6,250 acres on the south side of \nPelahatchie Bay. It is located within the fastest growing area of Rankin County. Construction and \ndevelopment activities in the watershed were thought to contribute the majority of sediment \npollution. There have been several recent projects in the Mill Creek watershed: a stabilization \nproject in 2010 and a project involving upland management practices and stream stabilization \nin 2007 through 2009. \nThe Rankin County Board of Supervisors worked with NRCS in 2010 to stabilize \n1,600 linear feet of Mill Creek using conventional practices and an additional 1,600 ft with \nnatural practices such as root wads and geotextile fabrics. The total cost of the project was \n$250,000, and was partially funded by NRCS through a Mississippi Conservation Initiative \n(MCI) cost-share program. The recently completed project is part of a large-scale stabilization \nproject proposed for Mill Creek. \nThe Mill Creek Watershed Implementation Team, led by the Rankin County Board of \nSupervisors, completed installation of upland management practices in 2009. The project also \nincluded practices to stabilize a section of Mill Creek. The project focused primarily on sediment \n                                                \n \n2\n http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/mississippi/news/news2389.html \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-13 \nas a pollutant. This project has consisted of education and outreach activities, implementation of \nBMPs for erosion and sedimentation control, and flow and water quality monitoring. The total \nbudgeted amount for the work described below was $1,087,447. Sixty percent of this budget was \npaid by MDEQ using Section 319 funds, and 40% was paid by Rankin County. \n \n• Bank stabilization of 850-ft section of Mill Creek in a residential area upstream of \nHighway 25 using riprap (estimated sediment savings of 1,564 tons/year); \n• Installation of rock dam at the upstream end of the stabilized section of a tributary \nof Mill Creek to control flow; \n• Grading and stabilization of drainage swale near entrance to Northwest Rankin \nHigh School using concrete pavers and underground slope drain; \n• Grading and stabilization of gulley on a sloped property near the Northwest \nRankin school complex; \n• Grading and stabilization of a gulley on another sloped property near the \nNorthwest Rankin school complex, including installation of check dams; \n• Installation of a rain garden in a drainage swale near an entrance to the Northwest \nRankin school complex; and \n• Grading and stabilization of a drainage ditch near the entrance to the Northwest \nRankin Elementary School. \n \nInstallation of these BMPs is expected to reduce erosion by over 8,700 tons of sediment \nper year. The Rankin County Board of Supervisors will be responsible for maintaining these \nBMPs. Education and outreach efforts have involved local students and builders, and included: \n \n• Development of factsheets, brochures, billboards, logos, and web pages by \nstudents with support of teachers and agencies; \n• WaterFest, a free annual social event;  \n• Land Development Stormwater Management Workshop attended by licensed \nbuilders, engineers, architects, and planning officials; \n• Stakeholder meetings; \n• Presentations; and \n• Newspaper and radio ads. \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-14 \nThe US Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted extensive monitoring in the Mill \nCreek watershed. Six USGS monitoring sites collected flow and suspended sediment data to \ncharacterize the discharge-sediment load relationships in the watershed, and to monitor the effect \nof erosion control projects in the watershed. Only two of the monitoring sites were activated \nprior to 2000. Water-level data are also being collected to develop stage-flow relationships. \n(Rankin County Board of Supervisors et al. 2009). As of December 2010, monitoring has \ncontinued at Mill Creek at Highway 25 and a tributary to Mill Creek. \n \n5.3 Fannegusha Creek Restoration Project \nThe Fannegusha Creek watershed is a 46,943-acre watershed located in Rankin and Scott \ncounties in central Mississippi. The drainage area of this watershed is comprised of \napproximately 46% agricultural lands. This project identified sediment as the primary pollution \nproblem in Fannegusha Creek. The overall goal of the project was to implement best \nmanagement practices on targeted areas in the Fannegusha Creek watershed to reduce pollutant \nloadings from agricultural nonpoint sources. The project funds were used to install 101 practices \naffecting 5,307 acres of land. The BMPs included the installation of terraces in row-crop fields, \ngrade stabilization structures at selected streams, and agricultural management practices such as \npasture and hayland planting, nutrient management, and fencing. MSWCC calculated that \n189,283 tons of soil were saved through installation of BMPs in the watershed. The total \nbudgeted amount for the work described above was $946,152. Sixty percent of this budget was \npaid by MDEQ using Section 319 funds, and 40% was contributed by local landowners \n(MSWCC 2009). \n \n\nAppendix M  \nExisting Management and Restoration October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nM-15 \n6.0 REFERENCES \n \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks. 2005.

The  bioretention  system  may  be  \ndesigned  with  an  underdrain  to  collect  treated  water  \nand  convey  it  to  discharge,  or  it  may  be  designed  to  \ninfiltrate  the  treated  water  directly  to  the  subsoil.  \nBioretention  cells  are  capable  of  reducing  sediment,  \nnutrients, oil and grease, and trace metals. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Maximum contributing drainage area of 5 acres. \n• Can be integrated with site landscaping. \n• Depending on the soil type and depth to water table, the bioretention area can be \ndesigned to infiltrate into the underlying soil. \n• Should be located close to the source of runoff to limit the amount of concentrated \nflow to the basin. \n• Not recommended in areas with steep slopes. \n• Detailed design information and requirements for bioretention basins/rain gardens \nare  available  in  the  Planning  and  Design  Manual  for  the  Control  of  Erosion,  \nSediment,  and  Storm  Water,  Volume  2:  Stormwater  Runoff  Management  Manual.  \nThis  publication  is  available  from  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Environmental  \nQuality (MDEQ) and online at http://www.deq.state.ms.us\n. \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nBioretention  basins  can  be  installed  in  existing  \nlandscaped  areas  and  designed  to  connect  to  \nexisting    stormwater    infrastructure    systems    \nwithin  the  developed  and  urbanized  area  of  the  \nwatershed.  In  addition  to  retrofitting,  they  can  \nbe    incorporated    into    the    design    of    the    \ndevelopments.

They can be created by excavating an \nalready  existing  natural  depression  or  through  the  construction  of  embankments.  \nThese  should  not  be  confused  with  conventional  dry  detention  basins  that  do  not  \nprovide a permanent pool. Dry detention basins fail to demonstrate an ability to meet \nthe  majority  of  water  quality  goals,  are  prone  to  clogging  and  resuspension  of  \npreviously  settled  solids,  and  require  a  higher  frequency  of  maintenance  than  wet  \nponds. \n \nIn a stormwater pond, runoff from each rain event is detained and treated in the pool \nthrough gravitational settling and biological uptake until it is displaced by runoff from \nthe  next  storm.  The  permanent  pool  also  serves  to  protect  deposited  sediments  from  \nresuspension.  Above  the  permanent  pool  level,  additional  temporary  storage  (live  \nstorage) is provided for runoff quantity control. \n \nThere  are  several  different  variants  of  stormwater  pond  design,  the  most  common  of  \nwhich include the wet pond, the wet extended detention (ED) pond, and the micropool \nED pond. In addition, multiple stormwater ponds can be placed in series or parallel to \nincrease performance or meet site design constraints. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Minimum  contributing  drainage  area  of  \n25  acres;  10  acres  for  micropool  ED  \npond. \n• A    sediment    forebay    or    equivalent    \nupstream     pretreatment     must     be     \nprovided. \n• Minimum length to width ration for the \npond is 1.5:1. \n• Maximum  depth  of  the  permanent  pool  \nshould not exceed 8 feet. \n• Side  slopes  to  the  pond  should  not  \nexceed 3:1 (horizontal:vertical). \n• Use may be limited by depth to bedrock. \n• Use  may  be  limited  by  soil  permeability  or  groundwater  levels,  or  require  special  \ndesign measures to control exfiltration of retained water or inflow of groundwater. \n• Detailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  stormwater  retention/detention  \nponds  are  available  in  the  Planning  and  Design  Manual  for  the  Control  of  Erosion,  \nSediment,  and  Storm  Water,  Volume  2:  Stormwater  Runoff  Management  Manual.  \nSource: Georgia Stormwater Management Manual\n\n \n \n \n \nThis  publication  is  available  from  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Environmental  \nQuality (MDEQ) and online at http://www.deq.state.ms.us\n. \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nStormwater  ponds  are  generally  applicable  to  most  types  of  new  development  and  \nredevelopment,  and  can  be  used  in  both  residential  and  nonresidential  areas.  Ponds  \ncan also be used in retrofit situations. \n \nGenerally,  dry  weather  base  flow  and/or  large  contributing  drainage  areas  are  \nrequired  to  maintain  pool  elevations.  Because  wet  basins  remove  soluble  pollutants,  \nthey  are  ideal  for  sites  where  nutrient  loadings  are  expected  to  be  high.  In  such  \ninstances,  source  controls  must  also  be  implemented  to  further  reduce  nutrient  \nloadings. The site soils, depth to bedrock, and depth to water table are additional site \nconstraints that should be assessed prior to designing a stormwater pond. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant Efficiency \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS)    80% \nTotal Nitrogen 30% \nTotal Phosphorus 50% \nMetals                                       50%                                       \nPathogens (coliform, E. coli) 70% (if no resident waterfowl population is present) \n \nCost \nThe construction costs associated with wet ponds range considerably. A recent study \n(Brown and Schueler 1997) estimated the cost of a variety of stormwater management \npractices. The study resulted in the following cost equation, adjusting for inflation: \n \nC = 24.5V\n0.705 \n \nWhere: \nC = Construction, design and permitting cost; \nV = Volume in the pond to include the 10-year storm (ft\n3\n). \n \nUsing this equation, typical construction costs are: \n• $45,700 for a 1 acre-foot facility. \n• $232,000 for a 10 acre-foot facility. \n• $1,170,000 for a 100 acre-foot facility. \n \nPonds  do  not  consume  a  large  area  relative  to  the  drainage  size  of  the  watershed  \n(typically  2.3%  of  the  contributing  drainage  area).  It  is  important  to  note,  however,  \n\n \n \n \n \nthat  these  facilities  are  generally  large  and  require  a  relatively  large  contiguous  area.  \nOther practices, such as filters or swales, may be \"squeezed\" into relatively unusable \nland, but ponds need a relatively large continuous area. \n \nFor ponds, the annual cost of routine maintenance is typically estimated at about 3% \nto 5% of the construction cost. Alternatively, a community can estimate the cost of the \nmaintenance  activities  outlined  in  the  maintenance  section.  Ponds  are  long-lived  \nfacilities  (typically  longer  than  20  years).  Thus,  the  initial  investment  into  pond  \nsystems may be spread over a relatively long time period. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  water  resource  protection  benefits  of  wet  ponds,  there  is  some  \nevidence  to  suggest  that  wet  ponds  may  provide  an  economic  benefit  by  increasing  \nproperty  values.  The  results  of  one  study  suggest  that  \"pond  front\"  property  can  \nincrease  the  selling  price  of  new  properties  by  about  10%  (EPA  1995).  Another  study  \nreported   that   the   perceived   value   (i.e.,   the   value   estimated   by   residents   of   a   \ncommunity)  of  homes  was  increased  by  about  15%  to  25%  when  located  near  a  wet  \npond (Emmerling-DiNovo 1995). \n \nBenefits \n• Moderate to high removal rate of urban pollutants. \n• High community acceptance. \n• Opportunity for wildlife habitat. \n• Can increase adjacent property values when properly planned and sited. \n• Sediment  generally  needs  to  be  removed  less  frequently  than  for  other  best  \nmanagement practices (BMPs). \n• Can be used in retrofits. \n• Provides good water quantity control for reducing the frequency of flooding events \nthat cause bank erosion. \n \nLimitations \n• Potential for thermal impacts/downstream warming. \n• More costly than extended dry detention basins. \n• Larger storage volumes for the permanent pool and flood control require more land \narea. \n• Infiltration  and  groundwater  recharge  is  minimal,  so  runoff  volume  control  is  \nnegligible. \n• Moderate to high maintenance requirements. \n• Can be used to treat runoff from land uses with higher pollutant loads if bottom is \nlined and sealed. \n• Invasive species control required. \n• Sometimes can create problems such as nuisance odors, algae blooms, and rotting \ndebris when not properly maintained. \n• May  attract  excessive  waterfowl,  which  can  be  a  nuisance  and  can  increase  fecal  \ncoliform levels. \n\n \n \n \n \nMaintenance \n• Remove debris from inlet and outlet structures. \n• Maintain side slopes/remove invasive vegetation. \n• Monitor sediment accumulation and remove periodically. \n• Inspect wet basins to ensure they are operating as designed at least once a year. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe target audience for this practice is developers and decision-makers involved with \nlandscape-scale  stormwater  issues.  Developers  should  be  encouraged  to  include  \nimproved designs for stormwater ponds in new and retrofit projects. Opportunities to \npresent  information  about  this  practice  include  collaborative  training  and  workshops  \nand the green infrastructure (GI) incentive program. Decision-makers include city and \ncounty  government  officials  who  approve  stormwater  management  plans.  This  group  \nwill be educated about stormwater ponds through participation in the watershed team \nand stormwater management training. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nAMEC  Earth  &  Environmental,  the  Center  for  Watershed  Protection,  Debo  and  \nAssociates, Jordan Jones and Goulding, and the Atlanta Regional Commission. \n2001.

There  are  four  \nmajor  types  of  infiltration  devices:  infiltration  trenches,  infiltration  basins,  dry  wells,  \nand subsurface structures. \n \nInfiltration Trenches \nInfiltration  trenches  are  shallow  excavations  filled  with  stone.  The  stone  provides  \nunderground  storage  for  stormwater  runoff.  The  stored  runoff  gradually  exfiltrates  \nthrough  the  bottom  and/or  sides  of  the  trench  into  the  subsoil,  and  eventually  into  \nthe water table. \n \nInfiltration Basins \nInfiltration  basins  are  stormwater  runoff  impoundments  that  are  constructed  over  \npermeable soils. Runoff from the design storm is stored until it exfiltrates through the \nsoil of the basin floor. \n \nDry Wells \nDry  wells  consist  of  small  excavated  pit  filled  with  stone,  or  a  small  structure  \nsurrounded  by  stone,  used  to  temporarily  store  and  infiltrate  runoff  from  a  very  \nlimited  contributing  area.  Runoff  enters  the  structure  through  an  inflow  pipe,  inlet  \ngrate, or through surface infiltration. The runoff is stored in the structure and/or void \nspaces  in  the  stone  fill.  Dry  wells  are  well-suited  to  receive  roof  runoff  via  building  \ngutter and downspout systems. \n \nSubsurface Structures \nSubsurface   structures   are   underground   \nsystems  that  capture  runoff,  and  gradually  \ninfiltrate  it  into  the  groundwater  through  \nrock  and  gravel.  There  are  a  number  of  \nunderground  infiltration  systems  that  can  \nbe    installed    to    enhance    groundwater    \nrecharge.  The  most  common  types  include  \npre-cast  concrete  or  plastic  pits,  chambers  \n(manufactured pipes), perforated pipes, and \ngalleys. \n \nInfiltration basin. \nSource: Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook \n \n \n\n \n \nInfiltration  practices  differ  from  filtering  practices  in  that  stormwater  is  infiltrated  \nthrough  native  soil  and  allowed  to  recharge  groundwater,  while  filtration  practices  \ntypically employ non-native soil materials or other media, and may use underdrains to \nconvey the filtered water to discharge. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Pretreatment must be provided if the infiltration BMP will receive stormwater other \nthan roof runoff. \n• The  underlying  soils  should  have  an  infiltration  rate  of  0.5  inch  per  hour  or  \ngreater. \n• An observation well should be installed to monitor percolation. \n• Careful  consideration  during  construction  is  required  to  prevent  sediment  from  \nclogging the underlying soils. \n• Infiltration devices transfer more stormwater to the soil than any other type of best \nmanagement practice (BMP), and they more closely mimic the natural hydrology of \nthe  area  by  taking  a  portion  of  concentrated  flow  and  allowing  it  to  infiltrate  into  \nthe soil. \n• Detailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  infiltration  devices  are  available  \nin the Planning and Design Manual for the Control of Erosion, Sediment, and Storm \nWater,  Volume  2:  Stormwater  Runoff  Management  Manual.  This  publication  is  \navailable from MDEQ and online at http://www.deq.state.ms.us\n. \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nInfiltration BMPs can be suitable for treating runoff from drainage areas (ranging up to \n50  acres  in  size  for  infiltration  basins)  where  subsoil,  groundwater  conditions,  and  \ndepth  to  bedrock  are  appropriate.  Infiltration  BMPs  can  be  used  for  a  wide  range  of  \nland  uses,  including  commercial,  residential,  industrial,  and  gravel  mining  sites.  \nHowever,  some  industrial  and  commercial  areas  have  contaminants  that  may  pose  a  \nrisk  of  groundwater  contamination.  In  this  case,  infiltration  should  not  be  used  \nwithout  adequate  treatment  of  runoff  prior  to  entering  the  device.  In  some  cases,  \ninfiltration measures should be avoided in favor of other BMPs. \n \nInfiltration  devices  work  best  in  relatively  small  drainage  areas  that  are  completely  \nimpervious  or  stabilized.  Infiltration  devices  are  frequently  used  to  infiltrate  runoff  \nfrom adjacent impervious surfaces, such as parking lots and roof tops. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant Efficiency \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) 80% to 85% \nTotal Nitrogen 30% to 60% \nTotal Phosphorus 35% to 60% \nMetals                                                       90%                                                       \nPathogens (coliform, E. coli)                       90%                       \n \n \n\n \n \nCost \nInfiltration  trenches  are  slightly  expensive  when  compared  to  other  stormwater  \npractices,  in  terms  of  cost  per  area  treated.  Typical  construction  costs,  including  \ncontingency  and  design  costs,  are  about  $5  per  cubic  foot  of  treated  stormwater  \n(Southeastern  Wisconsin  Regional  Planning  Commission  [SWRPC]  1991;  Brown  and  \nSchueler 1997). Infiltration trenches typically consume a relatively small 2% to 3% of \nthe drainage site. In addition, infiltration trenches can fit into thin, linear areas. Thus, \nthey can generally fit into relatively unusable portions of a site. \n \nInfiltration basins are relatively cost-effective practices, because little infrastructure is \nneeded  when  constructing  them.  One  study  estimated  the  total  construction  cost  at  \nabout  $2  per  cubic  foot  (adjusted  for  inflation)  of  storage  for  a  0.25-acre  basin  \n(SWRPC  1991).  Infiltration  basins  typically  consume  about  2%  to  3%  of  the  site  \ndraining  to  them,  which  is  relatively  small.  Maintenance  costs  are  estimated  at  \napproximately 5% to 10% of construction costs. \n \nThe  construction  cost  of  a  dry  well  can  vary  greatly  depending  on  design  variability,  \nconfiguration,  location,  site-specific  conditions,  etc.  Typical  construction  costs  in  \n2003  dollars  range  from  $4  to  $9  per  cubic  foot  of  storage  volume  provided.  Annual  \nmaintenance  costs  have  been  reported  to  be  approximately  5%  to  10%  of  the  capital  \ncosts (Cahill Associates, Inc., and the Stormwater Manual Oversight Committee 2006). \n \nThe construction cost of subsurface infiltration structures can vary greatly depending \non design variations, configuration, location, desired storage volume, and site-specific \nconditions,  among  other  factors.  Typical  construction  costs  are  about  $5.70  per  \nsquare  foot,  which  includes  excavation,  aggregate  (2.0  feet  assumed),  non-woven  \ngeotextile, pipes and plantings. \n \nOne cost concern associated with infiltration practices is the maintenance burden and \nlongevity. If improperly maintained, infiltration basins have a high failure rate. Thus, it \nmay be necessary to replace the basin after a relatively short period of time. \n \nBenefits \n• Helps recharge groundwater, which supports dry-weather flows in streams. \n• Helps  reduce  frequency  of  flooding  by  reducing  the  amount  of  water  flowing  to  \nsurface waters. \n• Pollutant removal efficiencies are generally as good as other BMPs. \n• Preserves the natural water balance of the site. \n• Good for small sites with porous soils. \n \nLimitations \n• Potential for groundwater contamination. \n• High  failure  rates  due  to  improper  siting,  inadequate  pretreatment,  poor  design,  \nand lack of maintenance. \n• Restricted to fairly small drainage areas. \n• Not appropriate for treating significant loads of sediment and other pollutants. \n \n \n\n \n \n• Requires frequent maintenance. \n• May  cause  undesirable  groundwater  seepage  into  basements  and  foundations  if  \nnot properly sited. \n \nMaintenance \n• Systems  should  be  inspected  at  least  twice  annually,  and  following  any  rainfall  \nevent exceeding 2.5 inches in a 24-hour period, with maintenance or rehabilitation \nconducted as warranted by such inspection. \n• Pretreatment measures should be inspected at least twice annually, and cleaned of \naccumulated sediment as warranted by inspection, but no less than once annually. \n• If  an  infiltration  system  does  not  drain  within  72  hours  following  a  rainfall  event,  \nthen a qualified professional should assess the condition of the facility to determine \nmeasures  required  to  restore  infiltration  function,  including  but  not  limited  to  \nremoval of accumulated sediments or reconstruction of the infiltration device. \n• Debris should be removed from inlet and outlet structures. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe target audience for this practice is developers and decision-makers involved with \nlandscape-scale  stormwater  issues.  Developers  should  be  encouraged  to  include  \ninfiltration devices in the design for new and retrofit projects on sites with appropriate \nsoils.  Opportunities  to  present  information  about  this  practice  include  collaborative  \ntraining   and   workshops   and   the   green   infrastructure   (GI)   incentive   program.   \nDecision-makers include city and county government officials who approve stormwater \nmanagement  plans.  This  group  will  be  educated  about  infiltration  devices  through  \nparticipation in the watershed team and stormwater management training. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nAlabama  Soil  and  Water  Conservation  Committee.  2009.

As stormwater \nflows through the wetland facility, pollutant removal is achieved through settling and \nuptake by marsh vegetation. \n \nWetlands  are  among  the  most  effective  stormwater  \npractices  in  terms  of  pollutant  removal  and  also  \noffer     aesthetic     value     and     wildlife     habitat.     \nConstructed    stormwater    wetlands    differ    from    \nnatural    wetland    systems    in    that    they    are    \nengineered  facilities  designed  specifically  for  the  \npurpose of treating stormwater runoff and typically \nhave less biodiversity than natural wetlands both in \nterms  of  plant  and  animal  life.  However,  as  with  \nnatural  wetlands,  stormwater  wetlands  require  a  \ncontinuous  base  flow  or  a  high  water  table  to  \nsupport aquatic vegetation. There are several design \nvariations of the stormwater wetland, each differing \nin  the  relative  amounts  of  shallow  and  deepwater,  \nand  dry  storage  above  the  wetland.  These  include  \nthe   shallow   wetland,   the   extended   detention   \nshallow  wetland,  pond/wetland  system,  and  the  \npocket wetland. \n \nDesign Considerations \nSource: Mississippi Museum of Natural Science\n• Requires  sufficient  contributing  area  and/or  groundwater  elevation  to  maintain  a  \npermanent pool. \n• The use of stormwater wetlands may be limited by the depth to bedrock. \n• May increase water temperature, which may affect use in watersheds of cold water \nfisheries. \n• Minimum contributing drainage area of 25 acres; 5 acres for pocket wetland. \n• Detailed design information and requirements for constructed stormwater wetlands \nare  available  in  the  Planning  and  Design  Manual  for  the  Control  of  Erosion,  \nSediment,  and  Storm  Water,  Volume  2:  Stormwater  Runoff  Management  Manual.  \nThis  publication  is  available  from  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Environmental  \nQuality (MDEQ) and online at http://www.deq.state.ms.us\n. \n \n \n \n\n \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \nStormwater  wetlands  are  generally  applicable  to  most  types  of  new  development  and  \nredevelopment,  and  can  be  utilized  in  both  residential  and  non-residential  areas.  \nHowever,  due  to  the  large  land  requirements,  wetlands  may  not  be  practical  in  \nhigher-density areas. \n \nSite  constraints  that  can  limit  the  suitability  of  constructed  stormwater  wetlands  \ninclude  inappropriate  soil  types,  depth  to  groundwater,  contributing  drainage  area,  \nand available land area. Soils consisting entirely of sands are inappropriate unless the \ngroundwater   table   intersects   the   bottom   of   the   constructed   wetland,   or   the   \nconstructed stormwater wetland is installed above the sand to hold water. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant Efficiency \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) 80% \nTotal Nitrogen 30% \nTotal Phosphorus 40% \nMetals                                                       50%                                                       \nPathogens (coliform, E. coli)                       Insufficient                       data                       \n \nCost \nWetlands  are  relatively  inexpensive  stormwater  practices.  Construction  cost  data  fo\n\nr  \nwetlands  are  rare,  but  one  simplifying  assumption  is  that  they  are  typically  about  \n25 percent more expensive than stormwater ponds of an equivalent volume. Using this \nassumption, an equation developed by Brown and Schueler (1997) to estimate the cost \nof  wet  ponds  can  be  modified  to  estimate  the  cost  of  stormwater  wetlands  using  the  \nequation: \n \nC = 30.6V\n0.705 \n \nWhere: \nC = Construction, design, and permitting cost; and \nV = Wetland volume needed to control the 10-year storm (ft\n3\n). \n \nUsing this equation, typical construction costs are the following: \n \n• $57,100 for a 1 acre-foot facility. \n• $289,000 for a 10 acre-foot facility. \n• $1,470,000 for a 100 acre-foot facility. \n \nWetlands consume about 3% to 5% of the land that drains to them, which is relatively \nhigh compared with other stormwater management practices. \n \n \n \n\n \n \nFor  wetlands,  the  annual  cost  of  routine  maintenance  is  typically  estimated  at  about  \n3% to 5% of the construction cost. Alternatively, a community can estimate the cost of \nthe   maintenance   activities   outlined   in   the   maintenance   section.   Wetlands   are   \nlong-lived  facilities  (typically  longer  than  20  years).  Thus,  the  initial  investment  into  \nthese systems may be spread over a relatively long time period. \nAlthough no studies are available on wetlands in particular, there is some evidence to \nsuggest  that  wet  ponds  may  provide  an  economic  benefit  by  increasing  property  \nvalues. The results of one study suggest that \"pond frontage\" property can increase the \nselling  price  of  new  properties  by  about  10%  (US  Environmental  Protection  Agency  \n[EPA] 1995). Another study reported that the perceived value (i.e., the value estimated \nby  residents  of  a  community)  of  homes  was  increased  by  about  15%  to  25%  when  \nlocated near a wet pond (Emmerling-DiNovo 1995). It is anticipated that well-designed \nwetlands,  which  incorporate  additional  aesthetic  features,  would  have  the  same  \nbenefit. \n \nBenefits \n• Relatively low maintenance costs. \n• Best  BMP  for  maximum  TSS,  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus  removal  while  also  \nproviding stormwater volume control. \n• Aesthetically pleasing when properly maintained and can be sited in both low-and \nhigh-visibility areas. \n• Can provide excellent habitat for wildlife and waterfowl. \n \nLimitations \n• Depending upon design, may require more land than other BMPs. \n• Until  vegetation  is  well  established,  pollutant  removal  efficiencies  may  be  lower  \nthan anticipated. \n• Relatively high construction costs compared to other BMPs. \n• Needs continuous base flow for viable wetlands. \n• Poorly  maintained  stormwater  wetlands  can  be  colonized  by  invasive  species  that  \nout-compete native wetland plants. \n• Creates potential breeding habitat for mosquitoes. \n• May present a safety issue for nearby pedestrians. \n• Can  serve  as  decoy  wetlands,  intercepting  breeding  amphibians  moving  toward  \nvernal pools. \n \n \n \n\n \n \nMaintenance \n• Inspect wetland during both the growing and non-growing seasons twice a year for \nthe first 3 years after construction. \n• Replace wetland vegetation to maintain at least 50% surface area coverage. \n• Remove invasive vegetation. \n• Monitor sediment accumulation and remove periodically. \n• Periodic mowing of embankments. \n• Removal of woody vegetation from embankments. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe target audience for this practice is developers and decision-makers involved with \nlandscape-scale  stormwater  issues.  Developers  should  be  encouraged  to  include  \nconstructed   stormwater   wetlands   in   the   design   for   new   and   retrofit   projects.   \nOpportunities to present information about this practice include collaborative training \nand workshops and the green infrastructure (GI) incentive program.

This  porous  surface  \nreplaces  traditional  pavement,  allowing  parking  lot,  driveway,  and  roadway  runoff  to  \ninfiltrate  directly  into  the  soil  and  receive  water  quality  treatment.  All  permeable  \npaving  systems  consist  of  a  durable,  load-bearing,  pervious  surface  overlying  a  stone  \nbed  that  stores  rainwater  before  it  infiltrates  into  the  underlying  soil.  Permeable  \npaving  techniques  include  porous  asphalt,  pervious  concrete,  paving  stones,  and  \nmanufactured  “grass  pavers”  made  of  concrete  or  plastic.  Permeable  paving  may  be  \nused  for  walkways,  patios,  plazas,  driveways,  parking  stalls,  and  overflow  parking  \nareas. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Soil  infiltration  rate  of  0.3  inch  per  hour  or  \ngreater required. \n• Generally,  porous  pavements  should  not  be  \nused on slopes greater than 5%. \n• A  3-foot  buffer  between  the  bottom  of  the  \nstone  bed  and  the  seasonal  high  groundwater  \nelevation   and   a   2-foot   buffer   for   bedrock   \nshould be maintained. \n• Particular    care    must    be    taken    during    \nconstruction     to     assure     preparation     of     \nsubgrade,    placement    of    aggregates,    and    \ninstallation    of    pavements    meets    design    \nspecifications. \nSource: Georgia Stormwater Management Manual \n• System should not be placed on compacted fill. \n• Permeable   pavements   are   generally   applicable   to   low-traffic   access   ways,   \nresidential  drives,  overflow  or  low-use  parking  areas,  pedestrian  access  ways,  \nalleys,  bike  paths,  and  patios.  Because  of  the  reduced  strength  of  pavement  \nassociated   with   permeable   pavement   surfaces   such   as   porous   asphalt   and   \nconcrete,  these  surfaces  are  not  typically  appropriate  for  high-traffic  or  heavy  \nvehicle loads. \n• Detailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  porous  pavement/pavers  are  \navailable  in  the  Planning  and  Design  Manual  for  the  Control  of  Erosion,  Sediment,  \nand   Storm   Water,  Volume  2:  Stormwater  Runoff  Management  Manual.  This  \npublication is available from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n(MDEQ) and online at http://www.deq.state.ms.us\n. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nPorous  paving  is  an  excellent  technique  for  dense  urban  areas,  because  it  does  not  \nrequire any additional land. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant Efficiency \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) \n80%  (if  storage  bed  is  sized  to  hold  water  quality\n \nvolume and designed to drain within 72 hours) \nTotal Nitrogen 65% to 80% \nTotal Phosphorus 50% to 80% \nMetals                                       60%                                       to                                       90%                                       \nPathogens (coliform, E. coli)       Insufficient       data       \n \nCost \nPermeable  asphalt  costs  range  from  $5  to  $11  per  square  meter  ($0.50  to  $1.00  per  \nsquare  foot),  while  permeable  concrete  costs  between  $22  and  $70  per  square  meter  \n($2.00  and  $6.50  per  square  foot).  Interlocking  concrete  paving  blocks  cost  $54  to  \n$108  per  square  meter  ($5.00  to  $10.00  per  square  foot).  In  addition,  permeable  \npavements may reduce or eliminate the need for additional stormwater infrastructure, \nso  a  more  accurate  price  comparison  would  involve  the  costs  of  the  full  stormwater  \nmanagement  paving  system.  For  example,  a  grass/gravel  paver  and  porous  concrete  \nrepresentative   stated   that   when   impervious   paving   costs   for   drains,   reinforced   \nconcrete  pipes,  catch  basins,  outfalls  and  storm  drain  connections  are  included,  an  \nasphalt   or   conventional   concrete   stormwater   management   paving   system   costs   \nbetween  $102  and  $125  per  square  meter  ($9.50  and  $11.50  per  square  foot),  \ncompared to a permeable pavement stormwater management system at $50 to $70 per \nsquare  meter  ($4.50  to  $6.50  per  square  foot)  (Department  of  Defense  2004).  The  \nsavings  are  considered  to  be  even  greater  when  permeable  paving  systems  are  \ncalculated  for  their  stormwater  storage;  if  designed  properly,  they  can  eliminate  \nretention pond requirements. \n \nBenefits \n• Reduces runoff from paved surfaces. \n• Reduces peak discharge rates. \n• Increases recharge through infiltration. \n• Reduces pollutant transport through direct infiltration. \n• Can be used as a retrofit when parking lots are replaced. \n• Reduces stormwater infrastructure (piping, catch basins, ponds, curbing, etc.) \n\n \n \nLimitations \n• Application  limited  to  areas  with  soil  with  higher  infiltration  rates  greater  than  \n0.3 inch per hour. \n• Prone to clogging, so aggressive maintenance with jet washing and vacuum street \nsweepers is required. \n• Special care is needed to avoid compacting underlying parent soils. \n• Not applicable for high-traffic areas or for use by heavy vehicles. \n• Potential for high failure rate if not adequately maintained or used in unstabilized \nareas. \n• Potential for groundwater contamination if proper buffer is not maintained between \nthe system and the water table. \n• Special attention to design and construction needed. \n \nMaintenance \n• Inspect  the  porous  pavement  after  each  storm  event.  Inspectors  should  check  for  \nponding on the surface which might indicate local or widespread clogging. \n• The porous pavement site should be posted with signs indicating the nature of the \nsurface,  and  warning  against  resurfacing  the  site  with  conventional  pavement  or  \nthe use of materials which could affect the infiltration capacity of the surface. \n• No winter sanding of permeable pavements is permitted. \n• Minimize application of salt for ice control. \n• Inspect annually for pavement deterioration or spalling. \n• For  porous  asphalt  and  concrete,  clean  periodically  (two  to  four  times  per  year)  \nusing  a  vacuum  sweeper.  Power  washing  may  be  required  prior  to  vacuum  \nsweeping, to dislodge trapped particles. \n• For  interlocking  paving  stones,  periodically  add  joint  material  to  replace  lost  \nmaterial. \n• For seeded grid systems, periodic reseeding of grass pavers to fill in bare spots. \n• Major  clogging  may  necessitate  replacement  of  pavement  surface,  and  possibly  \nfilter course and sub-base course. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe target audience for this practice is developers and decision-makers involved with \nlandscape-scale  stormwater  issues.  Developers  should  be  encouraged  to  include  \npervious pavement in appropriate areas for new and retrofit projects. Opportunities to \npresent  information  about  this  practice  include  collaborative  training  and  workshops  \nand the green infrastructure (GI) incentive program. Decision-makers include city and \ncounty  government  officials  who  approve  stormwater  management  plans.

They  are  designed  to  treat  the  required  water  quality  \nvolume  (WQv)  and  to  convey  runoff  from  the  10-year  storm  without  causing  erosion.  \nThere are two primary water quality swales, the dry swale and wet swale (or wetland \nchannel).  Dry  and  wet  swales  are  not  to  be  confused  with  a  filter  strip  or  grassed  \nchannel. The water quality swales are engineered to provide a higher level of pollutant \nremoval than the grassed channel. \nWet Swale \nSource: Georgia Stormwater Management Manual \n \nDry Swale \nThe dry swale is a vegetated conveyance channel designed to include a filter bed \nof prepa\n\nred soil that overlays an underdrain system. Dry swales are sized to allow the \nentire WQv to be filtered or infiltrated through the bottom of the swale. Because they \nare dry most of the time, they are often the preferred option in residential settings. \n \nWet Swale (Wetland Channel) \nThe  wet  swale  is  a  vegetated  channel  designed  to  retain  water  or  marshy  \nconditions that support wetland vegetation. A high water table or poorly drained soils \nare  necessary  to  retain  water.  The  wet  swale  essentially  acts  as  a  linear  shallow  \nwetland treatment system, where the WQv is retained. \nDry Swale \nSource: Georgia Stormwater Management Manual \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Longitudinal slopes must be less than 4%. \n• Bottom width should be 2 to 8 feet. \n• Side slopes of 2:1 or flatter; side slopes of 4:1 recommended. \n• Should convey the 25-year storm event with a minimum of 6 inches of freeboard. \n• Detailed design information and requirements for water quality swales are available \nin  Section  3.2.6,  Enhanced  Swales,  of  the  Georgia   Stormwater   Management   \nManual,  Volume  2:  Technical  Handbook  (first  edition).  This  publication  is  available  \nfrom    the    Georgia    Environmental    Protection    Division    and    online    at    \nhttp://www.georgiastormwater.com/vol2/3-2-6.pdf\n. \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nWater  quality  swales  have  many  uses.  Dry  swales  are  most  applicable  to  residential  \nand  institutional  land  uses  of  low  to  moderate  density  where  the  percentage  of  \nimpervious  cover  in  the  contributing  areas  is  relatively  low.  Wet  swales  may  not  be  \nappropriate  for  some  residential  applications,  such  as  frontage  lots,  because  they  \ncontain standing water and may attract mosquitoes. \n \nWater quality swales may also be used in parking lots to break up areas of impervious \ncover. Along the edge of small roadways, use water quality swales in place of curb and \ngutter systems. Water quality swales may not be suitable for sites with many driveway \nculverts or extensive sidewalk systems. \n \nThe  topography  and  soils  on  the  site  will  determine  what  is  appropriate.  The  \ntopography  should  provide  sufficient  slope  and  cross-sectional  area  to  maintain  \nnon-erosive flow velocities. Porous soils are best suited to dry swales, while soils with \npoor  drainage  or  high  groundwater  conditions  are  more  suited  to  wet  swales.  The  \nprimary   factors   to   consider   when   designing   water   quality   swales   are   soil   \ncharacteristics, flow capacity, erosion resistance, and vegetation. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant Efficiency \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) 80% \nTotal Nitrogen Dry Swale: 50% / Wet Swale: 40% \nTotal Phosphorus Dry Swale: 50% / Wet Swale: 25% \nMetals Dry Swale: 40% / Wet Swale: 20% \nPathogens (coliform, E. coli)                       Insufficient                       data                       \n \n \n\n \n \nCost \nLimited  data  exist  on  the  cost  to  implement  water  quality  swales,  although  they  are  \nrelatively inexpensive to construct compared to other stormwater treatment practices. \nThe  cost  to  design  and  construct  most  water  quality  swales  can  be  estimated  as  \n$0.50 per square foot of swale surface area, based on 1997 prices. These costs should \nbe adjusted for inflation to reflect current costs. \n \nBenefits \n• Combines stormwater treatment with runoff conveyance system. \n• May be used to replace more expensive curb and gutter systems. \n• Roadside swales provide water quality and quantity control benefits, while reducing \ndriving hazards by keeping stormwater flows away from street surfaces. \n• Accents natural landscape. \n• Compatible with low-impact design (LID). \n• Can be used to retrofit drainage channels and grass channels. \n• Little or no entrapment hazard for amphibians or other small animals. \n \nLimitations \n• Higher degree of maintenance required than for curb and gutter systems. \n• Subject to erosion during large storms. \n• Individual dry swales treat a relatively small area. \n• Impractical in areas with very flat grades, steep topography or poorly drained soils. \n• Wet swales can produce mosquito breeding habitat. \n• Should be set back from shellfish growing areas and bathing beaches. \n \nMaintenance \n• Inspect  swales  to  make  sure  vegetation  is  adequate  and  slopes  are  not  eroding.  \nCheck for rilling and gullying. Repair eroded areas and revegetate. Perform within \nthe first few months after construction and twice a year thereafter. \n• Maintain grass heights of approximately 4 to 6 inches (dry swale). Wet swales may \nnot need to be mowed depending on vegetation. \n• Remove sediment and debris manually at least once a year. \n• Re-seed as necessary. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe target audience for this practice is developers and decision-makers involved with \nlandscape-scale stormwater issues. Developers should be encouraged to include water \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nquality  swales  in  appropriate  locations  in  new  and  retrofit  projects.

Grassed  \ntreatment  swales  are  designed  to  promote  sedimentation  by  providing  a  minimum  \nhydraulic  residence  time  within  the  channel  under  design  flow  conditions  (water  \nquality flow). This best management practice (BMP) may also provide some infiltration, \nvegetative  filtration,  and  vegetative  uptake.  Conventional  grass  channels  and  ditches  \nare primarily designed for conveyance. Treatment swales, in contrast are designed for \nhydraulic residence time and shallow depths under water quality flow conditions. As a \nresult,  treatment  swales  provide  higher  pollutant  removal  efficiencies.  Pollutants  are  \nremoved   through   sedimentation,   adsorption,   biological   uptake,   and   microbial   \nbreakdown. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Grassed   treatment   swales   should   be   \ndesigned  so  that  the  flow  travels  the  full  \nlength to receive adequate treatment. \n• All   channels   should   be   designed   for   \ncapacity and stability. \n• Vegetation should be select based on site \nsoils     conditions,     planned     mowing     \nrequirements   (height,   frequency),   and   \ndesign flow velocities. \n• Should  not  be  used  on  slopes  greater  \nthan  4%;  slopes  between  1%  and  2%  \nrecommended. \n• Ineffective  unless  carefully  designed  to  achieve  low  velocity  rates  in  the  channel  \n(less than 1.0 foot per second). \n• Swale shape should be trapezoidal or parabolic. \n• Swale must have greater than 85% vegetated growth prior to receiving runoff. \n• Bottom of swale must be above seasonal high water table. \n• Detailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  “the  management  practice”  are  \navailable  in  the  Planning  and  Design  Manual  for  the  Control  of  Erosion,  Sediment,  \nand   Storm   Water,  Volume  2:  Stormwater  Runoff  Management  Manual.  This  \npublication is available from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nand online at http://www.deq.state.ms.us\n. \n \nSource: Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. \n\n \n \n \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nGrass  channels  are  well  suited  to  a  number  of  applications  and  land  uses,  including  \ntreating  runoff  from  roads  and  highways  and  pervious  surfaces.  The  suitability  of  \ngrassed   swales   depends   on   land   use,   soil   type,   slope,   imperviousness   of   the   \ncontributing  watershed,  and  dimensions  and  slope  of  grassed  swale  system.  Typical  \nsituations  where  grass  swales  can  be  used  include  roadside  ditches,  channels  at  \nproperty boundaries, outlets for diversions and other concentrated flow areas subject \nto channel erosion. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant Efficiency \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) 50% \nTotal Nitrogen 20% \nTotal Phosphorus 25% \nMetals                                                         30%                                                         \nPathogens (coliform, e coli) Insufficient data \n \nCost \nGrassed  swale  construction  costs  are  estimated  at  approximately  $2.70  per  square  \nmeter  ($0.25  per  square  foot.)  These  costs,  however,  do  not  include  design  costs,  \nraising the total cost to approximately $5.40 per square meter ($0.50 per square foot.) \nGrassed swale costs compare favorably with other stormwater management practices. \n \nBenefits \n• Can be used as part of the runoff conveyance system to provide pretreatment. \n• Grass  channels  can  act  to  partially  infiltrate  runoff  from  small  storm  events  if  \nunderlying soils are pervious. \n• Less expensive than curb and gutter systems. \n• Open drainage system aids maintenance. \n• Accepts sheet flow or pipe flow. \n• Compatible with low-impact design (LID) measures. \n• Little or no entrapment hazard for amphibians or other small animals. \n \nLimitations \n• Potential for bottom erosion and resuspension. \n• Short retention time does not allow for full gravity separation. \n• Limited biofiltration provided by grass lining. \n• Must  be  designed  carefully  to  achieve  low  flow  rates  for  water  quality  volume  \npurposes (less than 1.0 foot per second). \n• Mosquito control considerations. \n\n \n \n \n \nMaintenance \n• Inspect annually for erosion, sediment accumulation, vegetation loss, and presence \nof invasive species. \n• Perform periodic mowing; frequency depends on location and the type of grass. Do \nnot cut shorter than water quality flow depth (maximum 4 inches). \n• Remove debris and accumulated sediment, based on inspection. \n• Repair eroded areas, remove invasive species and dead vegetation, and reseed with \napplicable grass mix as warranted by inspection. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe target audience for this practice is developers and decision-makers involved with \nlandscape-scale  stormwater  issues.  Developers  should  be  encouraged  to  include  \ngrassed  swales  in  the  design  for  new  and  retrofit  projects.  Opportunities  to  present  \ninformation about this practice include collaborative training and workshops and the \ngreen infrastructure (GI) incentive program. Decision-makers include city and county \ngovernment  officials  who  approve  stormwater  management  plans.

Filter strips are uniformly graded \nand  densely  vegetated  sections  of  land  engineered  and  designed  to  treat  runoff  from  \nand  remove  pollutants  through  vegetative  filtering  infiltration.  Vegetated  filter  strips  \nare designed to slow runoff velocities, trap sediment, and promote infiltration, thereby \nreducing  runoff  volumes.  Vegetated  filter  strips  typically  treat  sheet  flow  or  small  \nconcentrated  flows  that  can  be  distributed  along  the  width  of  the  strip  using  a  level  \nspreader. \n \n \nSource: Department of Defense, Unified Facilities \nCriteria (UFC) \nA  level  spreader  is  constructed  at  a  virtually  zero  (0%)  grade  across  the  slope  \nconsisting  of  a  permanent  linear  structure  used  to  disperse  or  \"spread\"  concentrated  \nflow thinly over a vegetated or forested riparian buffer or filter strip. Its purpose is to \nspread  concentrated  water  over  a  wide  enough  area  so  that  erosion  of  vegetated  \nbuffers or filter strips does not result (Van Der Wiele 2007). \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Runoff  from  an  adjacent  impervious  area  must  be  evenly  distributed  across  the  \nfilter strip as sheet flow. \n• Filter  strips  can  be  used  as  part  of  the  runoff  conveyance  system  to  provide  \npretreatment. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n• Can provide groundwater recharge. \n• Reasonably low construction cost, but has a relatively large land requirement. \nDetailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  vegetated  filter  strips  with  level  \nspreaders  are  available  in  the  Planning  and  Design  Manual  for  the  Control  of  \nErosion,  Sediment,  and  Storm  Water,  Volume  2:  Stormwater  Runoff  Management  \nManual,  available  from  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Environmental  Quality  and  \nonline  at  \n• \nhttp://www.deq.state.ms.us\n,  as  well  as  in  the  Level  Spreader  Design  \nGuid  l   es, available from the North Carolina Division of Water Quality and online \nat \ne in\nhttp://h2o.enr.state.nc.us/su/documents/LevelSpreaderGuidance_Final_-\n3.pdf. \nited applications). \n New development. \nas a pre-treatment device \ns (BMPs). \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit (in lim\n•\n \nTypical application will be new development due to the land required, but they can be \ninstalled as a retrofit if there is enough space.

Instead  of  \nhaving asphalt, gravel, or shingles on a roof, live plants and growing media are placed. \n \nSod-covered  houses  were  common  throughout  much  of  Europe  and  western  North  \nAmerica,  yet  new  technologies  are  allowing  for  their  use  on  modern  residential,  \ncommercial,  and  industrial  buildings.  A  green  roof  typically  consists  of  vegetation,  a  \ngrowing  medium,  impermeable  membranes,  drainage,  and  sometimes  supplemental  \nirrigation. Green roofs help to mitigate the effects of urbanization on water quality by \nfiltering, absorbing, or detaining rainfall. \n \nGreen  roofs  are  either  intensive  or  extensive,  \nreferring to the soil media depth and ultimate \nweight upon the roof.  \n \nIntensive  green  roofs  have  growing  media  \nranging from 8 inches to 24 inches in depth, \nwhich allow for the inclusion of larger shrubs \nand  even  trees,  with  weight  loads  ranging  \nfrom   60   to   200   pounds   per   square   foot.   \nIntensive     roofs     require     more     regular     \nmaintenance  and  are  suited  to  structures  \nthat can support heavier loads. \n \nExtensive  green  roofs  have  shallower  soils  \nranging  from  2  inches  to  7  inches  in  depth,  typically  allowing  for  herbaceous  plants  \nand  groundcovers,  and  weight  loads  ranging  from  16  to  35  pounds  per  square  foot.  \nThis  is  usually  more  suitable  for  existing  roof  types  as  it  is  lighter  in  weight.  \nMaintenance considerations are generally lower for extensive types. \nSource: Mississippi State University \n \nWith any green roof project, an architect or structural engineer should determine the \nweight loads that the roof will support. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• The location of the green roof is very important in the design, which is influenced \nby factors such as height above ground, wind exposure, and sunlight and shade by \nsurrounding buildings. \n• A building must be able to support the loading of green roof materials under fully \nsaturated conditions. \n \n \n\n \n \n• Detailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  green  roofs  are  available  in  the  \nPlanning and Design Manual for the Control of Erosion, Sediment, and Storm Water, \nVolume  2:  Stormwater  Runoff  Management  Manual.  This  publication  is  available  \nfrom   the   Mississippi   Department   of   Environmental   Quality   and   online   at   \nhttp://www.deq.state.ms.us\n. \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nGreen roofs can be applied to new construction or retrofitted to existing construction. \nThey are applicable on residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and are easily \nconstructed  on  roofs  with  up  to  a  20%  slope.  Many  cities  such  as  Chicago  and  \nWashington,  DC,  are  actively  encouraging  green  roof  construction  as  a  means  to  \nreduce  stormwater  runoff  and  combined  sewer  overflows.  Other  municipalities  are  \nencouraging green roof development with tax credits or density credits, or by allowing \na small impervious credit to be applied to other structural best management practice \n(BMP) requirements. \n \nGreen  roofs  are  applicable  in  all  parts  of  the  country.  In  climates  with  extreme  \ntemperatures,  green  roofs  provide  additional  building  insulation,  which  makes  them  \nmore financially justifiable for many facility operators. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant Efficiency \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) Insufficient data \nTotal Nitrogen Insufficient data \nTotal Phosphorus Insufficient data \nMetals                                                          Insufficient                                                          data                                                          \nPathogens (coliform, E. coli)                          Insufficient                          data                          \n \nCost \nExtensive green roofs range in price from approximately $5 per square foot to $20 per \nsquare  foot.  However,  there  are  significant  cost  savings  associated  with  reducing  \nenergy consumption and longer roof lifespan. For instance, the green roof on the Gap \nbuilding  in  San  Bruno,  California,  more  than  covered  the  additional  cost  associated  \nwith  its  construction  through  energy  savings  within  a  few  years.  Annualized  costs  \nshould  be  lowered  considerably  by  the  roof's  increased  lifespan.  Furthermore,  some  \nmunicipalities  offer  incentives  to  help  defray  the  higher  up-front  costs  of  green  roof  \nconstruction. \n \nIntensive green roofs can be considerably more expensive than extensive green roofs. \nEstimates range from $20 to $80 per square foot. Other benefits should be taken into \naccount, however, such as recreational space provided and costs relative to the price \nof land in an area. \n \n \n \n\n \n \nBenefits \n• Reduces volume and peak rate of runoff from more frequent storms. \n• Reduces heating and cooling costs for the buildings. \n• May  extend  life  expectancy  of  the  roof  by  shielding  the  roof  from  ultraviolet  rays  \nand temperature. \n• Provides sound insulation. \n• Ideal for redevelopment or in the ultra-urban setting. \n \nLimitations \n• Precipitation captured by green roofs (through interception, storage, plant uptake, \nevapotranspiration) is not recharged to groundwater. \n• If  green  roofs  require  irrigation  to  maintain  plans,  they  may  reduce  the  volume  of  \nwater available for other purposes. \n• May require additional structural strengthening if used for retrofit. \n \nMaintenance \nImmediately  after  construction,  green  roofs  need  to  be  monitored  regularly  to  ensure  \nthe  vegetation  thrives.  During  the  first  season,  green  roofs  may  need  to  be  watered  \nperiodically  if  there  is  not  sufficient  precipitation.  After  the  first  season,  extensive  \ngreen roofs may only need to be inspected and lightly fertilized approximately once per \nyear.  The  roofs  may  need  occasional  weeding  and  may  require  some  watering  during  \nexceptionally dry periods. If leaks should occur in the roof, they are relatively easy to \ndetect  and  fix.  Intensive  green  roofs  need  to  be  maintained  as  any  other  landscaped  \narea. This can involve gardening and irrigation, in addition to other roof maintenance. \nGreen roofs are less prone to leaking than conventional roofs. In most cases, detecting \nand  fixing  a  leak  under  a  green  roof  is  no  more  difficult  than  doing  the  same  for  a  \nconventional roof. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nImplementation  of  this  practice  is  voluntary  and  would  be  applied  on  individual  lots  \nand  homes.  For  these  reasons,  the  target  audience  for  this  practice  is  the  general  \npublic. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nBrzuszek, R.F. 2010. “Green Roofs for Southern Landscapes” (fact sheet).

Rain  barrels  and  cisterns  are  low-cost  \nwater-conservation  devices  that  reduce  runoff  volume  and,  for  very  small  storm  \nevents,   delay   and   reduce   the   peak   runoff   flow   rates.   Cisterns   are   essentially   \nlarge-scale rain barrels. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Cisterns  or  rain  barrels  can  be  applied  across  \nvarious site conditions. \n• Rain  barrels  and  cisterns  can  be  implemented  \nwithout  the  use  of  pumping  devices,  instead  \nrelying on gravity flow. \n• Sizing  is  based  on  expected  water  demands,  \nrainfall patterns, and cistern system costs. \n• Detailed  design  information  and  requirements  \nfor  rain  barrels/cisterns  are  available  in  the  \n“Cisterns/Rain  Barrels”  section  of  the  Florida \nField  Guide  to  Low  Impact  Development.  This  \npublication  is  available  from  the  University  of  \nFlorida    IFAS    Extension,    and    online    at    \nhttp://buildgreen.ufl.edu/Fact_%20sheet_Cisterns_Rain_Barrels.pdf\n. \nSource: Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nCisterns and rain barrels are applicable to most commercial and residential properties \nwhere there is a gutter and downspout system to direct roof runoff to the storage tank. \nThey  take  up  little  room  and  can  be  used  in  dense  urban  areas.  Rain  barrels  and  \ncisterns are excellent retrofit techniques for almost any circumstance. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nRain barrels and cisterns do not provide primary pollutant removal benefits. However, \nsimilar  to  the  benefits  of  green  roofs,  rainwater  harvesting  with  cisterns  reduces  \nstormwater  runoff  through  interception,  reducing  stress  of  downstream  management  \nand treatment systems. \n \n \n \n\n \n \nCost \nMaterials   and   installation   costs   vary   substantially   across   cistern   applications,   \ndepending  on  the  source  (e.g.,  manufactured  or  pre-fabricated  versus  constructed  \nonsite),  storage  capacity  (size),  location  (above-  or  below-ground),  and  structural  \nmaterial.  A  single  residential  rain  barrel  with  typical  attachments  and  accessories  \ncosts around $50 for the parts for self-assembly and $200 assembled, whereas cistern \ncosts can start at about $1,500 and a large commercial cistern can cost thousands or \ntens  of  thousands  of  dollars.  These  upfront  costs  can  be  partially  offset  by  reduced  \ndemand for potable water, but they do not directly offset regularly incurred materials \nand installation costs of conventional stormwater system components. \n \nBenefits \n• Can reduce water demand for irrigation or other non-potable uses. \n• Property  owners  save  money  on  water  bills  by  using  stored  water  for  landscape  \npurposes. \n• Public water systems may experience lower peak demand in summer. \n• When  properly  installed,  rain  barrels  and  cisterns  reduce  stormwater  runoff  \nvolume for small storms. \n \nLimitations \n• Provides mosquito-breeding habitat unless properly sealed. \n• May  need  to  be  disconnected  and  drained  in  winter  to  avoid  cracking  of  storage  \nstructure. \n \nMaintenance \nRain  barrels  and  cisterns  require  minimal  maintenance.  The  tank  should  be  cleaned  \nout  about  once  a  year  if  debris  is  present.  Gutters  and  downspouts  should  be  \ninspected  regularly  and  kept  clear.  If  a  first-flush  bypass  system  is  used,  remove  \ndebris  from  the  bypass  and  make  sure  drain  holes  are  kept  open  so  that  the  system  \nfunctions properly. No maintenance is required to prevent mosquito breeding in a rain \nbarrel if all surfaces at the downspout entrance are sealed. However, the seals should \nbe  inspected  periodically,  and  if  mosquit\n\noes  become  a  problem,  mosquito  dunks  \n(floating,   donut-shaped   briquettes   containing   the   biological   insecticide   Bacillus \nthuringiensis) should be used. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nImplementation  of  this  practice  is  voluntary  and  would  be  applied  on  individual  lots  \nand  homes.  For  these  reasons,  the  target  audience  for  this  practice  is  the  general  \npublic. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nClark, M., and G.

In  this  \ntechnique, lot sizes, setbacks, and frontage distances are minimized to allow for open \nspace.  Open  space  areas  are  often  used  for  neighborhood  recreation,  stormwater  \nmanagement  facilities,  or  conservation  purposes.  Open  space  that  is  preserved  in  a  \nnatural  condition  needs  little  maintenance  and  helps  to  reduce  and  sometimes  treat  \nstormwater  runoff  from  development.  Open  space  design  is  most  applicable  in  areas  \nwith  moderate  base  zoning  density  requirements  (less  than  six  dwelling  units  per  \nacre). \n \nDesign Considerations \nOpen   space   development   is   allowed   in   \nzoning ordinances in Rankin and Madison \ncounties  in  areas  designated  as  Planned  \nUrban  Development  (PUD)  districts.  PUD  \ndistricts are superimposed over residential \ndevelopments.  They  must  maintain  the  \ndensity  requirements  over  the  residential  \nzone    over    which    they    are    imposed.    \nHowever, minimum lot size and width can \nbe reduced and remaining land reserved in \ncontiguous  tracts  of  common  open  space  \nfor use by residents. \nPhoto by Angie Tornes, National Park Service.\nSource: Milwaukee River Basin Partnership (2003). \n \n \n \nDetailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  planned  unit  developments  are  \navailable in the Planning and Design Manual for the Control of Erosion, Sediment, and \nStorm Water,  Volume  2:  Stormwater  Runoff  Management  Manual.

All  of  these  maintenance  \npractices  have  the  potential  to  contribute  pollutants  to  the  storm  drain  system.  The  \nmajor objective of this best management practice (BMP) is to minimize the discharge of \npesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers to the storm drain system and receiving waters in \nurban areas. \n \nIntegrated  pest  management  (IPM),  a  sustainable  approach  to  managing  pests  by  \ncombining biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools, is described in more detail \nin a separate Fact Sheet. \n \nDesign Considerations \nThis design for this BMP includes a set of recommendations that apply to homeowners \nand   professionals   engaged   in   landscape   maintenance   activities.   Fertilizers   and   \npesticides  should  be  used  on  lawns  and  gardens  only  when  necessary.  Use  can  be  \nminimized  by  selecting  hearty  plants  that  are  native  to  the  area  (see  Table  1  and  \nhttp://www.msucares.com\n  for  lists  of  native  plants  and  shrubs).  If  it  is  necessary  to  \nuse  chemical  pesticides,  the  least  toxic  pesticide  that  targets  the  specific  pest  in  \nquestion  should  be  chosen.  Particular  attention  should  be  paid  to  areas  of  high-\nintensity  management,  such  as  cemeteries  and  golf  courses,  which  may  contribute  \nlarge amounts of excess fertilizer and pesticides to runoff. \n \n \nPlanting of native vegetation in Jackson, Mississippi.\nSource: Mississippi Museum of Natural Science\nPlantingof native vegetation in Jackson, Mississippi.\nSource: Mississi\nppi Museum of Natural Science\n \n \n\n \n \nTable 1.

Apply  pesticides  only  when  wind  speeds  \nare low (less than 5 mph). \n• Do not mix or prepare pesticides for application near storm drains. \n• Prepare  the  minimum  amount  of  pesticide  needed  for  the  job  and  use  the  lowest  \nrate that will effectively control the pest. \n• Employ techniques to minimize off-target application (e.g., spray drift) of pesticides, \nincluding consideration of alternative application techniques. \n• Calibrate   fertilizer   and   pesticide   application   equipment   to   avoid   excessive   \napplication. \n• Periodically test soils for determining proper fertilizer use. \n \n \n\n \n \n• Sweep  pavement  and  sidewalk  if  fertilizer  is  spilled  on  these  surfaces  before  \napplying irrigation water. \n• Purchase only the amount of pesticide that you can reasonably use in a given time \nperiod (monthly or annually, depending on the product). \n• Dispose  of  empty  pesticide  containers  according  to  the  instructions  on  the  \ncontainer label. \n• Detailed design information and requirements for pesticide and fertilizer BMPs are \navailable in Conservation Practice Standard Code 595: Integrated Pest Management. \nThis publication is available from the Natural Resources Conservation Service and \nonline at http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/standards/nhcp.html\n. \n \nImplementation \nThis practice can be practiced by homeowners and professional landscaping crews in \nany maintained area of vegetation. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant  removal  efficiency  depends  on  the  actual  practices  used  by  the  individuals.  \nOveruse  and  misuse  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides  are  common  in  urban  areas.  Proper  \nuse   could   significantly   reduce   fertilizers   and   pesticides   transported   in   urban   \nstormwater. \n \nCost \nProper  landscape  activities  are  very  cost  effective.  Promoting  the  growth  of  healthy  \nplants  that  require  less  fertilizer  and  pesticide  applications  minimizes  labor  and  \nmaintenance  costs  of  lawn  and  garden  care.  Using  water,  pesticides,  and  fertilizers  \nonly when necessary and replacing store-bought fertilizers with compost material can \nincrease the savings for a property owner as well as benefit the environment. \n \nBenefits \n• Proper  landscaping  techniques  can  effectively  increase  the  value  of  a  property.  \nAttractive,  water-efficient,  low  maintenance  landscapes  can  increase  property  \nvalues between 7% and 14% (US Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] 1993). \n• Reduced landscape maintenances costs for homeowners. \n \nLimitations \n• Due  to  the  extremely  hot  summers  experienced  in  central  Mississippi,  some  \nirrigation may be needed during dry periods. \n• Mississippi  soils  contain  low  levels  of  organic  material  and  may  need  additional  \nnutrients to support plant growth. \n• Compliance  is  voluntary.  It  is  not  practical  to  monitor  landscaping  practices  on  \nresidential properties. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe  target  audience  for  this  BMP  includes  homeowners  and  professional  lawn  \nservices.  Professional  service  suppliers  might  over  apply  fertilizers  and  pesticides  to  \nbetter  please  customers,  and  homeowners  may  not  know  the  proper  amounts  of  \nfertilizer and pesticides to use. Both groups might apply lawn-care chemicals too close \nto  waterbodies.  Local  governments  conduct  education  programs  for  local  citizens.  If  \nfunding  is  available,  local  governments  can  start  programs  for  area-wide  composting  \nusing  yard  waste  picked  up  at  the  curb.  The  compost  could  be  sold,  given  to  local  \ngardeners, or used in municipal management. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nBrzuszek,  R.F.  2007.

For  example,  roofs  \nand sidewalks commonly drain onto roads, and the runoff is conveyed by the roadway \ncurb and gutter to the nearest storm inlet. Runoff from numerous impervious drainage \nareas may converge, combining their volumes, peak runoff rates, and pollutant loads. \nDisconnection decouples roofs, roadways and other impervious areas from stormwater \nconveyance systems, allowing runoff to be collected and managed on site or dispersed \ninto  the  landscape.  Runoff  is  redirected  onto  pervious  surfaces  such  as  vegetated  \nareas,  reducing  the  amount  of  directly  connected  impervious  area  and  potentially  \nreducing the runoff volume and filtering out pollutants. \n \n \nMost  impervious  area  in  the  Florence  Gardens  \nsubdivision  in  Gulfport,  Mississippi,  drains  into  \nvegetated   areas.   Homes   are   clustered   close   \ntogether   and   rooftops   drain   into   landscaped   \nareas   (upper   left).   Meadow   areas   and   native   \nvegetation   treat   runoff   from   walking   trails   \n(upper  right).  Grassed  swales  carry  stormwater  \nfrom  sidewalks  and  roads.  Sidewalks  are  built  \nonly  on  one  side  of  the  street,  and  curb  and  \ngutter  systems  are  not  needed.  All  photos  by  \nLaura Sheely. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Disconnected areas should be graded so that stormwater runoff becomes sheet \nflow  and  is  directed  to  a  vegetated  filter  strip,  bioretention  basin,  or  pervious  \nlandscaped areas for treatment. \n• Disconnection can also reduce the calculated peak discharge rate by increasing \nthe time of concentration. \n• Lower  runoff  velocities  will  result  in  greater  contact  time  with  the  soil,  \npotentially increasing the runoff volume lost to infiltration. \n• Factors   influencing   runoff   velocity   include   slope   and   surface   roughness.   \nDecreasing  the  slope  and  increasing  surface  roughness  will  reduce  the  runoff  \nvelocity.  The  time  of  concentration  can  also  be  incre\n\nased  by  increasing  the  \nlength of the flow paths, (for instance, by increasing circuitousness). \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nDisconnection  practices  may  be  applied  in  almost  any  location,  but  impervious  \nsurfaces must discharge into a suitable receiving area for the practices to be effective. \nRunoff  must  not  flow  toward  building  foundations  or  onto  adjacent  private  property.  \nTypical  receiving  areas  for  disconnected  impervious  runoff  include  vegetated  best  \nmanagement  practices  (BMPs)  (e.g.,  filter  strips  or  bioretention)  and  other  existing  \nlandscaping such as shrubs. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nWater quality benefits are gained from disconnection practices because a percentage of \nthe  overall  stormwater  volume  infiltrates  into  pervious  areas  or  is  lost  through  \nevapotranspiration.  Pollutant  load  from  impervious  areas  is  a  product  of  pollutant  \nconcentration and the stormwater volume. Disconnection practices decrease the total \nvolume of stormwater discharged to receiving waterbodies. Therefore, the reduction in \npollutant  and  nutrient  loading  attributed  to  disconnection  is  dependent  upon  the  \nreduction in stormwater volume. \n \nThe  pollutant  removal  efficiency  is  also  dependent  on  the  type  of  area  to  which  the  \nstormwater  is  diverted.  For  example,  if  stormwater  is  diverted  to  a  properly  designed  \nbioretention  basin,  the  pollutant  removal  should  be  equivalent  to  the  levels  expected  \nfor  bioretention.  Pollutant  removal  rates  for  various  bioretention,  filtering,  and  \nvegetative BMPs are included in their respective fact sheets. \n \nCost \nThere   is   generally   assumed   to   be   little   cost   associated   with   implementing   a   \ndisconnection  program.  Disconnecting  roofs  requires  simple  modifications  typically  \ncosting  $100  or  less.  However,  there  will  likely  be  costs  associated  with  maintaining  \n \n \n\n \n \nthe areas where stormwater is directed. Bioretention basins, vegetated swales, or other \nvegetative areas may need to be constructed if they are not already present. \n \nBenefits \nRouting  runoff  to  vegetated  areas  will  reduce  the  peak  discharge  and  stormwater  \nvolume  by  providing  an  opportunity  for  infiltration  and  evapotranspiration.  The  \npotential  exists  for  runoff  to  be  completely  taken  “out  of  the  system”  by  spreading  it  \nout  and  infiltrating  it  over  pervious  surfaces  and  BMPs.  The  impact  of  disconnection  \non  stormwater  volume  and  peak  discharge  is  dependent  upon  the  area  to  which  the  \nstormwater is directed. \n \nLimitations \n• Most  disconnection  systems  can  handle  stormwater  from  only  a  small  amount  \nof impervious surface area. Most design manuals recommend a maximum area \nof  500  square  feet  per  system.  Thus,  applications  are  limited  to  residential  or  \nsmall commercial areas. Multiple treatment areas for larger disconnected areas \nare required. \n• Rain  gardens  and  other  BMPs  can  create  flooding  and  visual  nuisance  if  not  \nproperly designed and maintained \n \nMaintenance \nRelated maintenance activities are primarily focused on the areas designated to receive \nstormwater  runoff.  Infiltration  areas  should  be  routinely  checked  to  ensure  that  they  \nare free of debris and trash. Both vegetated and constructed infiltration areas should \nbe  inspected  for  sediment  accumulation.  Additionally,  receiving  areas  should  be  \ninspected for signs of channelized flow and signs of compaction. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe  target  audience  for  this  practice  is  developers  and  decision  makers.  Developers  \nshould  be  encouraged  to  include  bioretention  in  the  design  for  retrofit  and  new  \nprojects. Opportunities to present information about this practice include collaborative \ntraining  and  workshops  and  the  green  infrastructure  incentive  program.  Decision  \nmakers   include   city   and   county   government   officials   who   approve   stormwater   \nmanagement  plans.  This  group  will  be  educated  about  bioretention  basins  through  \nparticipation in the watershed team and stormwater management training. Education \nof  officials  is  vital  to  preventing  delays  or  difficulties  in  the  permit  approval  process  \nthat may occur when GI practices are used in place of conventional practices. Property \nowners will be encouraged to use bioretention in model retrofit projects. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nReferences \nInformation in the fact sheet is adapted from: \n \nFairfax    County,    Virginia.    2005.    “Disconnect    Impervious    Areas/Downspout    \nDisconnection.” Low Impact Development Best Management Practices Fact Sheet \nNo. 4.1.

Maintaining  a  vegetated  buffer  along  \ncreeks,  streams,  and  rivers  provides  an  attractive  landscape  and  can  improve  water  \nquality  by  removing  sediment  and  chemicals  before  they  reach  the  waterway.  In  \naddition,  buffers  provide  flood  control,  help  recharge  groundwater,  prevent  soil  \nerosion, and preserve or improve certain types of wildlife habitat. \n \nThe primary objective of the buffer strip should be determined prior to design. Various \nobjectives   might   include   protection   of   water   quality,   streambank   stabilization,   \ndownstream flood attenuation, or provision of wildlife habitat or movement corridors. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• The     width,     length,     and     plant     \ncomposition  of  a  buffer  will  determine  \nits  effectiveness,  and  should  be  based  \non the objective of the buffer strip. \n• Stormwater    flow    to    buffer    should    \ngenerally enter as sheet flow. \n• Slope  of  buffer  should  not  be  greater  \nthan 6%. \n• Level  spreaders  are  required  if  flow  to  \nbuffer is concentrated. \n• An   effective   urban   riparian   buffer   \nzones.  Zone  1  is  on  the  stream  or  \nshoreline       side       and       includes       \nundisturbed forest to provide shade and stabilize banks. Zone 2 is the middle zone \nand  should  also  be  forested,  but  limited  clearing  is  acceptable  as  well  as  passive  \nrecreational  uses.  Zone  3  is  the  outer  zone,  which  is  the  buffer  between  the  \nforested zones and development. This zone provides initial removal of pollutants. \n• Establishing continuou\ndesign  consists  of  three  preservation  \ns riparian forest buffers in the landscape should be given a \nation  and  requirements  for  riparian/vegetated  buffers  are  \nhigher  priority  than  establishing  fragmented  buffers.

Recommended  \nvegetative  plantings  for  the  areas  nearest  to  streams  (Zone  1)  include  the  following  \nnon-woody  species:  switchgrass  (Panicum  virgatum),  soft  rush  (Juncus  effusus  and  \nJuncus  spp.),  soft  stem  bulrush  (Scirpus  validus),  maidencane  (Panicum  hemitomon), \nand  water  willow  (Dianthera   americana).  Suitable  woody  trees  and  shrubs  are  \nnumerous and include willow (Salix spp.), cypress (Taxodium distichum),  overcup  oak  \n(Quercus  lyrata),  pin  oak  (Quercus palustris), Nuttall oak (Quercus  texana),  red  maple  \n(Acer rubrum), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), river birch (Betula nigra), water tupelo \n(Nyssa   aquatica),   green   ash   (Fraxinus   pennsylvanica),   and   sweetbay   magnolia   \n(Magnolia   virginiana).  Suitable  shrub  species  include  buttonbush  (Cephalanthus \noccidentalis),  common  alder  (Alnus  serrulata),  elderberry  (Sambucus  canadensis),  red  \nchokeberry (Aronia arbutifolia), Virginia sweetspire (Itea virginica), deciduous holly (Ilex \ndecidua),  and  nonflowering  dogwood  (Cornus  amomum  and  C.  foemina).  Rose  mallow  \n(Hibiscus  moscheutos) is a non-woody perennial that is shrub-like in appearance and \nprovides large colorful flowers. Trees for areas farther away from the shoreline include \nall  of  those  listed  above;  these  tree  species  are  especially  tolerant  of  root  flooding  for  \nlong  periods  but  will  also  thrive  further  from  the  shoreline.  The  Mississippi  State  \nUniversity Extension Service has developed the following excellent guides for selecting \nappropriate  native  vegetation:  Native  Trees  for  Mississippi  Landscapes  and  Native \nShrubs for Mississippi Landscapes (Brzuszek 2007a, 2007b). The University of Georgia \n\n \n \n \n \nMarine Extension Service has developed a list of plants appropriate for riparian buffer \nrestoration.   Many   of   the   trees,   shrubs,   and   grasses   listed   in   this   publication   \n(University  of  Georgia  Marine  Extension  Service,  no  date)  will  most  likely  be  effective  \nfor the Reservoir watershed. \n \nWhether  riparian  buffers  should  be  revegetated  with  trees  or  grasses  is  a  question  of  \nost \nosts  depend  on  geographic  location,  number  of  acres  planted,  number  of  \nost-share  and  incentive  programs  exist  for  the  preservation  of  riparian  buffers,  for  \nenefits \numerous aesthetic and passive recreational benefits. \nmperature benefits. \n  \ne, which improves the habitat for aquatic organisms. \n \nildlife. \nongoing  discussion.  Both  grass  and  forest  buffers  can  reduce  levels  of  nutrients  and  \nsediments  from  surface  runoff,  and  reduce  levels  of  nitrates  from  subsurface  flows.  \nGrass  buffers  are  more  quickly  established,  and  in  terms  of  sediment  removal,  may  \noffer  greater  stem  density  to  decrease  the  velocity  of  water  flow  and  provide  greater  \nsurface  area  for  sediments  to  be  deposited.  Forested  buffers,  though,  offer  the  \nadvantage that the woody debris and stems may offer greater resistance and are not as \neasily inundated, especially during heavy floods (US Environmental Protection Agency \n[EPA]   Chesapeake   Bay   Program   Forestry   Work   Group   1993).   Higher   rates   of   \ndenitrification  are  often  observed  in  forested  buffers,  presumably  due  to  the  greater  \navailability  of  organic  carbon  and  interactions  which  occur  between  the  forest  \nvegetation and the soil environment (Lowrance et al. 1995; Correll 1997). \n \nC\nPlanting  c\ntrees planted per acre, species of trees, and whether or not the trees are from bare root \nor  container  stock.

Known  \ncost-share/incentive  programs  include  Conservation  Reserve  Program,  the  Wetland  \nReserve Program, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife \nProgram. \n \nB\n• Offers n\n• Provides water quality treatment, erosion control, and water te\n• Builds  support  for  greenways  within  riparian  buffers  in  urban  and  suburban\nwatersheds  by  maintenance  of  trails  that  are  well-constructed,  well-marked,  and  \nwell-signed. \n• Creates shad\n• Stabilizes the shoreline and eroding stream banks. \n• Has low maintenance requirements once established.\n• Can increase property values. \n• Provides food and habitat for w\n \n\n \n \nLimitations \n• Sometimes seen as unkempt public areas. \n• Can  be  perceived  as  interfering  with  views  of  streams,  especially  with  shrubby  \nbank-side vegetation. \n• In the worst cases, can be abused as places for dumping trash and litter. \n• May require development and adoption of an ordinance for urban application. \n• Will not repair damaged shorelines. \n• May obstruct views of the Reservoir. \n• Urban  runoff  can  concentrate  rapidly  from  paved  areas  and  cut  across  the  buffer  \nas channel flow, eliminating the intended function of passing through the buffer.  \n \nMaintenance \n• Inspect  buffer  at  least  annually  for  signs  of  erosion,  sediment  buildup,  or  \nvegetation loss. \n• If a meadow buffer, provide periodic mowing as needed to maintain a healthy stand \nof herbaceous vegetation. \n• If  a  forested  buffer,  then  the  buffer  should  be  maintained  in  an  undisturbed  \ncondition, unless erosion occurs. \n• If erosion of the buffer occurs, eroded areas should be repaired and replanted with \nvegetation  similar  to  the  remaining  buffer.  Corrective  action  should  include  \neliminating the source of the erosion problem, and may require retrofit with a level \nspreader. \n• Remove debris and accumulated sediment, based on inspection. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe target audience for this practice is developers and decision-makers involved with \nlandscape-scale  stormwater  issues.  Developers  should  be  encouraged  to  include  \nriparian  buffers  in  the  design  for  retrofit  projects  as  well  as  to  maintain  existing  \nbuffers in undeveloped areas. Opportunities to present information about this practice \ninclude  collaborative  training  and  workshops  and  the  green  infrastructure  (GI)  \nincentive program. Decision-makers include city and county government officials who \napprove  stormwater  management  plans.  This  group  will  be  educated  about  riparian  \nbuffers  through  participation  in  the  watershed  team  and  stormwater  management  \ntraining. Education of officials is vital to preventing delays or difficulties in the permit \napproval process that may occur when GI practices are used in place of conventional \npractices. Property owners will be encouraged to use restored riparian buffers in model \nretrofit projects.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \nReferences \nInformation in this factsheet is adapted from: \n \nAlabama  Soil  and  Water  Conservation  Committee.  2009.

Concentrated  water  flow  may  begin  as  minor  sheet  flow,  produce  rills,  \nand  eventually  result  in  major  gully  formation.  Due  to  the  highly  erosive  nature  of  \nsoils  in  the  Reservoir  watershed,  gullies  tend  to  form  easily  on  any  area  of  exposed  \nsoil. Gullies can have major impacts on an area by risking collapse of roads and taking \nland  out  of  production.  They  are  a  major  source  of  sediment.  Once  formed,  gullies  \ntypically  grow  with  time  and  will  continue  down-cutting  until  resistant  material  is  \nreached. They also expand laterally as they deepen. Gullies often form at the outlet of \nculverts  or  cross-drains  due  to  the  concentrated  flows  and  relatively  fast  water  \nvelocities.  Gullies  can  form  in  forested  areas  along  roads,  if  there  are  erosive  soils  or  \nstructures that cause concentrated water flow. \n \nDesign Considerations \nThe  design  needed  to  stabilize  a  gully  \ndepends  on  the  size  of  the  gully,  soil  \ntypes,  and  slopes.  Small  gullies  can  \nsometimes  be  managed  and  prevented  \nfrom  growing  simply  by  establishing  \nvegetation in the channel and along the \nside   walls.   Stabilizing   small   gullies   \nshortly   after   they   form   is   always   \nsimpler    and    less    expensive    than    \nrepairing  large  gullies.  Stabilization  of  \nlarger      gullies      typically      requires      \nremoving  or  reducing  the  source  of  \nwater  flowing  through  the  gully  and  \nrefilling  the  gully  with  dikes,  or  small  \ndams,  built  at  specific  intervals  along  \nthe  gully.  Reshaping  and  stabilizing  \nover-steep banks may also be needed. \n \nFor  large  gullies,  bioengineered  stabilization  structures  are  needed.  These  can  be  \nconstructed  of  rock,  gabions,  logs,  wood  stakes  with  wire  or  brush,  bamboo,  or  \nvegetative  barriers.  Bioengineering  methods  offer  a  combination  of  physical  structure  \nalong with vegetative measures for physical protection as well as additional long-term \nroot support and aesthetics. In large gullies, a headcut structure is sometimes needed \nto  stabilize  the  upslope,  or  top-most  portion  of  the  gully,  and  prevent  additional  \nheadward  movement.  Grade  stabilization  structures  are  typically  used  to  prevent  the  \nformation and advancement of gullies in row crop and pasture areas. \n \nSource: Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n\n \n \n \n \nLive  gully  repair  is  a  method  that  alternating  layers  of  live  branch  cuttings  and  \ncompacted  soil  to  repair  small  rills  and  gullies  a  maximum  of  2  feet  wide  and  1  foot  \ndeep. This method involves planting live branch cuttings and compacted fill material. \n \nDetailed  design  information  (including  a  diagram)  and  requirements  for  gully  repair  \nare  available  in  Water  Related  Best  Management  Practices  in  the  Landscape.  This  \npublication  is  available  from  the  Center  for  Sustainable  Design  and  online  at  \nhttp://www.abe.msstate.edu/csd/NRCS-BMPs/pdf/streams/bank/livegully.pdf\n. \n \nImplementation \n• Urban  areas  (gullies  often  form  near  roads  on  areas  with  exposed  soil  and  \nconcentrated flows). \n• Row-crop  agriculture  and  pasture  (gullies  may  form  near  areas  with  steep  grades  \nand disturbances of the soil). \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nSpecific   pollutant   removal   efficiencies   of   gully   stabilization   structures   are   not   \navailable. The pollutant loads reduced depend on the size of the gully and the nutrient \ncontent of the soil. A large gully in a row-crop or pasture area can contribute as much \nas 40 tons per acre per year of sediment. \n \nCost \nThe  cost  of  repairing  an  individual  gully  is  highly  variable  and  project-dependent.  \nNRCS  cost-sharing  programs  are  available  for  producers  to  repair  gullies  on  their  \nproperty. \n \nBenefits \n• Land area lost to gullies can be costly to producers and cause significant damage \nin urban areas. \n• Reduces  contributions  of  sediments  and  associated  nutrients  to  downstream  \nwaterbodies. \n \nMaintenance \n• Inspect on a routine basis. \n• Repair and re-vegetate as needed. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe  target  audiences  for  this  practice  are  landowners  who  manage  row-crop  and  \npasture lands and local leaders who manage road construction and maintenance. It is \nup  to  the  individual  landowners  to  recognize  the  formation  of  gullies  on  their  \nproperties.  Local  leaders  also  need  to  be  able  to  identify  gullies  and  understand  the  \nmethods  of  repairing  them.  Education  targeted  for  these  audiences  should  stress  the  \nneed for prevention and early intervention, which will result in significantly lower costs \nthan cost of repairing a major gully. \n\n \n \n \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nCenter  for  Sustainable  Design.  1999.  “Live  Gully  Repair.”  In  Section  C,  Stream  Bank  \nProtection  and  Restoration,  of  Stream  System  Protection,  Restoration,  and  \nReestablishment  Section.

It \nconsists  of  alternating  layers  of  live  branches  and  compacted  backfill.  Branches  trap  \nsediment  that  refills  the  localized  slump  or  hole,  while  roots  spread  throughout  the  \nbackfill and into the surrounding earth to form a unified mass. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Lake Wallenpaupack Homeowner Streambank and Shoreline Restoration Handbook. \n \n \n \nDesign Criteria \nDetailed design information and requirements for branch packings are available in the \nPlanning  and  Design  Manual  for  the  Control  of  Erosion,  Sediment,  and  Storm  Water, \nVolume  1:  Erosion  and  Sediment  Control  Manual.

The depth of water that receives mixing as \na   result   of   wave   action   is   approximately   half   the   \nwave-length. Natural woody vegetation has been removed \nin many areas along the shoreline due to residential and \nrecreational development. \n \nDue  to  the  shallow  depths  and  long  wind  fetch  in  the  \nReservoir,  wind-generated  waves  can  be  of  significant  \nconcern  because  they  resuspend  sediments  from  the  \nReservoir   bottom.   The   primary   purpose   of   Reservoir   \nshoreline  restoration  is  to  restore  woody  vegetation  to  \nreduce  erosion  from  wave  action  and  reduce  wind  fetch  \nalong  the  open  water.  Mature  woody  vegetation  planted  along  cleared  areas  of  the  \nshoreline functions as a windbreak. Once established, a windbreak will slow the wind \non the downwind side for a distance of approximately ten times the height of the tree \ncanopy.  This  ground  cover  created  by  trees  and  associated  debris  also  protects  soil  \nfrom  rill  and  sheet  erosion.  Ground  cover  helps  improve  water  quality  by  filtering  \nexcess nutrients and chemicals from surface runoff. Riparian buffers planted in trees \nalso provide shade, resulting in temperature refuge for fish and other aquatic life. \nFigure 1. Riparian buffer in Pelahatchie Bay. \n \nDesign Considerations \nLandscaping  or  replanting  locations  \nmust be selected and agreed upon by \nboth  the  current  lease  holders  and  \nthe  Pearl  River  Valley  Water  Supply  \nDistrict    (PRVWSD).    The    selected    \nlocations  should  also  consider  the  \nprevailing  wind  direction  in  relation  \nto  the  long  axis  of  the  Reservoir.  The  \nwind  rose  from  the  Jackson  airport  \nindicates  that  wind  blows  from  the  \nsouth   to   southeast   approximately   \n26%  of  the  time,  and  from  the  north  \nto    north-northwest    approximately    \n14% of the time. A windbreak situated \nFigure 2. Mill Creek at Spillway Road with no buffer. \n \n \n\n \n \nperpendicular  to  the  prevailing  wind  direction  (running  east  to  west  or  southwest  to  \nnortheast on the Rankin County shoreline) would be the most effective. \n \nSoil  types  on  the  Reservoir  shoreline  are  characterized  as  highly  erodible  silt  loam.  \nAlthough   there   are   currently   no   reported   concerns   of   bank   failures,   replacing   \nvegetation  along  the  shoreline  could  improve  bank  stabilization  and  prevent  future  \nfailures.  Native  species  of  shrubs  and  trees  should  be  used  for  shoreline  restoration.  \nNative vegetation is adapted to survive in the climate and soil conditions of Mississippi \nand  requires  less  maintenance  (fertilizer,  watering,  etc.).  Recommended  vegetative  \nplantings  for  the  areas  nearest  to  the  shoreline  include  the  following  non-woody  \nspecies: switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), cattail (Typha spp.), soft rush (Juncus effusus \nand Juncus   spp.),   soft   stem   bulrush   (Scirpus   validus),   maidencane   (Panicum \nhemitomon), and water willow (Dianthera americana). Suitable woody trees and shrubs \nare  numerous  and  include  willow  (Salix  spp.),  cypress  (Taxodium  distichum),  overcup  \noak  (Quercus  lyrata),  pin  oak  (Quercus  palustris),  Nuttall  oak  (Quercus  texana),  red  \nmaple (Acer rubrum), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), river birch (Betula nigra), water \ntupelo  (Nyssa  aquatica),  green  ash  (Fraxinus  pennsylvanica),  and  sweetbay  magnolia  \n(Magnolia   virginiana).  Suitable  shrub  species  include  buttonbush  (Cephalanthus \noccidentalis),  common  alder  (Alnus  serrulata),  elderberry  (Sambucus  canadensis),  red  \nchokeberry (Aronia arbutifolia), Virginia sweetspire (Itea virginica), deciduous holly (Ilex \ndecidua),  and  nonflowering  dogwood  (Cornus  amomum  and  C.  foemina).  Rose  mallow  \n(Hibiscus  moscheutos) is a non-woody perennial that is shrub-like in appearance and \nprovides large colorful flowers. Trees for areas farther away from the shoreline include \nall  of  those  listed  above;  these  tree  species  are  especially  tolerant  of  root  flooding  for  \nlong periods but will thrive further from the shoreline. The Mississippi State University \nExtension   Service   has   developed   the   following   excellent   guides   for   selecting   \nappropriate  native  vegetation:  Native  Trees  for  Mississippi  Landscapes  and  Native \nShrubs for Mississippi Landscapes (Brzuszek 2007a, 2007b). \n \nInitially the smaller, faster-growing plants would establish the restored riparian buffer \nzone.  These  plants  will  be  replaced  by  interspersed,  slower-growing,  taller  species  for  \nan  enhanced  wind  block.  The  smaller  species  should  be  thinned  as  necessary  to  \naccommodate the growth of taller trees. \n \nImplementation \n• Reservoir shoreline with little or no riparian buffer zone. \n• Along tributaries near the Reservoir with little or no riparian buffer zone. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant Efficiency \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) 60%  \nTotal Nitrogen 30% \nTotal Phosphorus 35% \n*Same as restored riparian buffer/vegetated buffer \n \n \n \n\n \n \nCost \nThe cost of riparian buffers ranges from low to almost negligible if established prior to \nsite  development.  Typically,  the  most  effective  buffer  is  one  that  is  left  alone  and  in  \nplace.  Therefore,  there  is  no  cost  of  establishment  and  the  only  monetary  constraint  \nmay be that associated with an alternative site design that excludes these areas from \ndevelopment.  However,  the  added  aesthetic  value  of  buffers  easily  translates  to  \nincreased property values and often offsets such foregone costs. Furthermore, buffers \nreduce  the  size  and  cost  of  downstream  control  facilities.  The  cost  of  creating  or  \nrestoring riparian buffer areas is highly variable and project-dependent. \n \nBenefits \nMaintaining or developing an attractive riparian zone can: \n• Increase property values. \n• Reduce excessive erosion. \n• Protect water quality. \n• Enhance wildlife habitat. \n• Contribute to the natural beauty of the land. \n• Dissipate noise from reservoir traffic, roads, and nearby properties. \n• Reduce maintenance time and related costs. \n• Provide privacy. \n• Enhance scenic views. \n \nLimitations \nBuffers  alone  may  not  provide  sufficient  stormwater  control  to  maintain  flows  at  \npredevelopment  levels.  Buffers  can  typically  handle  smaller  storms,  but  larger  events  \ncan  bypass  the  infiltration  and  treatment  capability  of  the  buffer  and  directly  \ndischarge  runoff  to  streams.  Therefore,  additional  stormwater  and  water  quality  \ncontrol measures are often necessary within highly developed areas. \n \nSome  landowners  may  be  resistant  to  establishing  vegetation  along  the  shoreline.  \nSome concerns may include loss of views, limiting access to the water, and concerns \nthat the vegetated area may attract unwanted wildlife. \n \nNot all sites will support vegetation because of toxic soil conditions or insufficient soil \nmoisture.  Erosion  must  be  controlled  upgradient  from  the  corridor  before  vegetation  \ncan be successfully established. \n \nMaintenance \nOnly minimal maintenance is required for riparian buffers. Dead vegetation should be \nallowed  to  remain,  as  it  provides  terrestrial  and  eventually  aquatic  habitat.  Soil  \ndisturbance and compaction and vege\n\ntation disturbance should be avoided. However, \nmaintenance  is  required  for  the  first  2  to  3  years  so  native  vegetation  can  become  \nestablished. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nAfter they become established, native plants usually require much less physical effort \nto  maintain  than  lawns.  They  can  reduce  or  eliminate  the  need  for  lawn  mowers,  \ntrimmers, and other gasoline-powered equipment. Native plants are also less costly to \nmaintain  because  they  generally  don’t  need  the  fertilizers  and  pesticides  that  turf  \ngrass and other non-native species may require. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe  limiting  factor  in  the  placement  of  restored  riparian  buffer  zones  in  landowner  \nparticipation,  thus  education  activities  for  this  management  practices  should  be  \ntargeted towards owners of shoreline property. Landowners need to be made aware of \nthe  positive  benefits  of  riparian  buffer  zones  and  the  technical  assistance  needed  to  \nproperly install them. Funding assistance to purchase and install the vegetation would \nbe helpful to landowner adoption. An educational flyer, titled Vegetated Buffers, gives \nspecific  tips  for  homeowners  about  how  to  establish  and  maintain  a  shoreline  buffer  \non their property. \n \nReferences \nAlcovy   Watershed   Protection   Project.

Significant  value  or  benefit  can  be  realized  if  proper  planning  and  coordination  \nexist between all parties involved. The suitability of dredged material for different uses \nvaries; however, a wide variety of beneficial use options are available for consideration. \n \nThe  Pearl  River  Valley  Water  Supply  \nDistrict (PRVWSD) removes significant \namounts of dredged material from the \nRoss Barnett Reservoir each year. This \nmaterial  is  currently  disposed  of  in  \nupland    areas    near    dredge    sites,    \nmarginal      wetland      areas,      and      \nin-reservoir  disposal  areas  to  create  \nsmall   islands   and   wildlife   habitat.   \nIdentifying  proper  disposal  sites  for  \nmanagers   is   a   significant   concern   \nbecause     dredging     activities     are     \nexpected  to  continue  on  a  frequent  \nbasis. \n \n \nDredging operations in Pelahatchie Bay. \nDesign Considerations \nBeneficial  uses  of  dredged  material  can  be  classified  in  three  broad  categories:  \nengineered  uses,  agricultural  and  product  uses,  and  environmental  enhancement.  \nPossible beneficial uses for sediments in the Reservoir are listed below. \n \n• Land creation and improvement. \n• Berm creation. \n• Shore protection. \n• Topsoil for agricultural areas. \n• Mine reclamation. \n• Manufactured construction material. \n• Wetland habitat improvement. \n \nThe  selection  of  a  beneficial  use  of  dredge  material  removed  from  the  Reservoir  will  \ndepend on a number of factors: \n \n• Grain size distribution. \n• Contaminant status of materials. \n \n \n\n \n \n• Technical  feasibility  (such  as  the  distance  that  dredge  material  would  need  to  be  \npumped). \n• Cost/benefit and legal constraints. \n \nHuge  amounts  of  sediment  could  be  pumped  or  conveyed  to  areas  onshore  and  \nstockpiled until used for landscaping soil, fill, or other purposes. It is possible that it \nmay be built into large mounds and planted with trees or grasses until needed. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant  removal  efficiency  cannot  be  estimated.  However,  one  would  expect  a  \nreduction  of  total  suspended  solids  (TSS)  released  to  the  Reservoir  from  marginal  \ndisposal sites. \n \nCost \nThe  cost  of  beneficial  use  projects  is  project-  and  site-specific.  Some  federal  funding  \nprograms administered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are available \nfor cost-share. Other options are available to develop local sources of funding. Details \nof these programs are described in Identifying, Planning, and Financing Beneficial Use \nProjects:  Beneficial  Use  Planning  Manual  (EPA  and  US  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  \n[USACE] 2007). \n \nBenefits \n• Project cost savings. \n• Habitat improvement. \n• Enhanced recreational opportunities. \n• Agricultural improvement. \n \nLimitations \n• Sediments need to be analyzed for toxic content prior to use. \n• Costs to transport the sediments would have to be weighed against the benefits. \n• Requires logistical coordination between the dredging of material and placement in \nthe beneficial use. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe  initial  decision  to  pursue  beneficial  uses  for  dredge  material  and  initiate  project  \npartners would be made by reservoir managers. The success of a beneficial use project \noften  depends  on  the  public’s  perception  of  the  project’s  purpose  and  its  impacts  on  \nhuman  health,  property  values,  and  the  environment.  Thus,  interested  stakeholders  \nshould  be  included  in  the  decision  making  process.  The  following  recommendations  \nare  included  in  Identifying,  Planning,  and  Financing  Beneficial  Use  Projects:  Beneficial  \nUse Planning Manual (EPA and USACE 2007). \n \n• Involve  the  public  from  the  outset.  Go  to  the  public;  do  not  wait  for  the  public  to  \ncome to you. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n• Identify and respond to issues of local concern. \n• Understand the decision-making process and schedule to identify points of public \naccess. \n• Make it clear how the public’s input will be used. \n• Use  a  variety  of  methods  to  inform  and  involve  segments  of  the  public  with  \ndifferent levels of interest. \n• Involve representatives of the public in project decision making. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nEPA  and  USACE.  2007.

Point \nof contact is Mr. Hollis Allen (formerly with the US Army Corps of Engineers Waterways \nExperiment Station, now with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality). \n \nDescription \nThis management practice involves the installation of a biodegradable breakwater with \nwetlands   planted   between   the   breakwater   and   the   shore.   Naturally   occurring   \nmaterials,  including  woody  trees  such  as  willow,  cottonwood,  and  alder,  can  be  used  \nto construct the breakwater. This method is applicable to reservoirs that do not have \nsignificant  water  level  fluctuation.  Thus,  it  could  be  used  in  the  Ross  Barnett  \nReservoir.  Development  of  wetlands  near  the  shoreline  would  stabilize  the  shoreline,  \nact as a filter for nutrients and suspended sediments in overland runoff, and provide \nwildlife  habitat.  Although  shoreline  failure  has  not  been  identified  as  a  particular  \nconcern  in  the  Reservoir,  breakwater  and  artificial  wetlands  would  protect  the  \nshoreline from erosion due to waves and prevent future issues. \n \nSource: Bioengineering Technique Used for Shoreline Reservoir Erosion Control in Germany. \n \n \n\n \n \nDesign Considerations \nThe  technique  includes  a  combination  of  a  breakwater  and  planted  wetlands.  The  \nbreakwater  can  be  constructed  from  various  materials,  including  stone  or  rocks,  \nbranches  and  poles,  or  fiberschines  (large  coconut  fiber  rolls).  The  branchbox  \nbreakwater  is  one  of  the  more  commonly  used  structures.  It  which  consists  of  \nbiodegradable materials composed of long poles and faschines (bundles of small dead \nbranches,  such  as  willow  and  poplar,  collected  from  woodlands).  The  breakwater  is  \nusually  constructed  at  a  water  depth  of  1  meter.  Construction  of  this  type  of  \nbreakwater  is  described  in  detail  in  the  referenced  WRP  Technical  Note  WG-SW-3.1.  \nWetland  plants  can  be  pre-grown  in  a  coconut  fiber  substrate  and  transferred  to  the  \nsite after the breakwater is constructed. Coconut fiber substrate allows for short-term \nshore stabilization until the vegetation becomes established. Recommended plants for \nthe  Reservoir  include  bulrushes  (Scirpus  spp.),  water  willow  (Dianthera  americana), \nhorsetail  (Equisetum  spp.),  iris  (Iris  spp.),  pickerel  weed  (Pontederia cordata),  rushes  \n(Juncus  spp.),  powdery  thalia  (Thalia  dealbata),  and  other  water-loving  herbaceous  \nplants in addition to buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), a woody shrub species. \n \nImplementation \n• Shoreline areas with suitable depth and light conditions, in areas at risk for future \nbank failure. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nNo   information   is   available   to   estimate   pollutant   removal   efficiency.   Expected   \nperformance would depend on site-specific conditions. \n \nCost \nA   cost   estimate   for   the   wetland   system   from   1991,   including   the   branchbox   \nbreakwater,  the  wetland  plants  installed  as  pallets  and  bulbs,  and  the  coconut-fiber  \nfilter fabric, was between $400 and $460 per linear meter for a 10- to 20-meter swath \nfrom the breakwater landward. \n \nBenefits \n• Low-cost erosion control without destroying the existing shoreline habitat. \n• Wetlands trap sediment and remove nutrients. \n• Aesthetic improvement. \n \nLimitations \n• Damage to the breakwater structure may result in the loss of wetlands. \n• Breakwater/wetland systems will not work if water fluctuations exceed 1 meter. \n \nMaintenance \n• Inspect every few months until the wetland vegetation becomes established, then at \nleast annually after that. \n• Repair the breakwater structure as needed. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nEducation and Outreach \nReservoir  managers  would  need  to  be  aware  of  this  practice  and  be  able  to  identify  \npotential sites for installation. If this practice is installed near areas with public access \nvia boats or shoreline, members of the public need to be instructed not to disturb the \nwetland  plants  or  damage  the  breakwater.  Restoration  sites  should  be  marked  with  \nappropriate signs with these instructions. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nBrzuszek,  R.F.  2010.  “Home  Landscape  in  Mississippi”  (fact  sheet).

The  \nislands  can  take  various  shapes  and  \nconsist  of  a  planting  substrate  made  \nof   granular   fibers,   cork,   or   other   \nmaterials.   Wetland   plants   such   as   \niris,  sedges,  rushes,  or  pickerelweed  \nare planted within the substrate. The \nplanting   substrate   supported   by   a   \nframe   made   of   plastic   or   other   \nmaterial that is resistant to corrosion, \naging due to sunlight, and destruction \nby  pests.  Once  placed  in  the  water,  the  islands  float  on  the  surface.  Vegetation  \ntypically becomes fully established in 2 years. \nSource: Floating Island Environmental Solutions \n \nArtificial   floating   islands   were   first   used   in   Germany   where   they   were   called   \n“Schwimmkanmpen” islands (loosely translated as floating grassland areas). Presently, \nthere  are  several  commercial  companies  in  the  United  States  that  manufacture  \nfloating islands. \n \nDesign Considerations \nFloating  islands  are  made  of  lightweight,  corrosion-proof  plastics.  The  islands  are  \nplanted  with  native  wetland  plants,  including  iris,  sedges,  rushes,  pickerelweed,  and  \narrow  arum.  Under  the  surface,  the  plant’s  roots  extend  through  the  planting  \nsubstrate and into the water. The plant roots and microbes that develop around them \nremove  nutrients  from  the  water.  Floating  islands  must  be  moored  to  the  bottom  or  \nshoreline.  Mooring  systems  may  include  poles,  buoys,  anchors,  ropes,  chains,  and  \nweights. \n \nImplementation \n• Floating  islands  could  be  used  in  coves  or  other  protected  areas  of  the  Reservoir.  \nPlacing  them  in  open  water  is  not  recommended  because  they  could  restrict  boat  \nmovement. \n• Manufacturers of floating islands claim that they can be used to improve quality in \nsmall  ponds  and  wet  stormwater  detention  ponds.  They  have  also  been  used  to  \nenhance existing wetlands. \n \n \n \n\n \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nA  commercial  manufacturer  states  that  floating  islands  can  remove  more  than  \n10 grams of total nitrogen per square foot per year and 0.7 gram of total phosphorus \nper square foot per year. These rates are based on information from one manufacturer. \n \nCost \nCommercial  manufacturers  in  the  United  States  sell  the  islands  for  $35  per  square  \nfoot.  This  cost  does  not  include  shipping,  planting  mix,  installation,  plants,  or  \nmooring. \n \nMaintenance \n• No  maintenance  is  required  once  the  islands  are  deployed  unless  they  are  \nvandalized. \n \nBenefits \n• Erosion and shoreline protection: \no When  placed  near  the  shoreline,  the  islands  can  protect  sensitive  banks  by  \nreducing the energy of waves. \no Can serve as a “wind break” by reducing wind fetch. \n• Water quality improvement through biological uptake of nutrients. \n• Improved landscape features. \n• Improved wildlife habitat. \n \nLimitations \n• Boaters  in  the  Reservoir  would  need  to  be  aware  of  the  islands  and  refrain  from  \ndisturbing them. \n• The floating islands could cause damage to boats or docks if they break free from \nthe moorings. \n \nEducation and Outreach \nThe initial decision to pursue the installation of floating islands in the Reservoir would \nbe made by Reservoir managers. Funding would be needed for design and installation \nof the islands. A small demonstration of the use of the islands should be considered to \nanalyze  the  cost  versus  the  benefits  of  this  measure.  If  installed,  the  public  would  \nneed to be aware of them and their use as a water quality improvement measure. This \ncould be included in the public outreach campaign. \n \nReferences \nInformation in this factsheet is adapted from: \nFloating  Island  Environmental  Solutions.  (no  date.)

Activities  of  the  Stormwater  Compliance  \nInitiative  have  significantly  increased  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Environmental  \nQuality’s (MDEQ) presence in the watershed with the following activities. \n \n•\n\n Additional   review   of   stormwater   \nmanagement     plans     for     new     \ndevelopments. \n• Frequent  informal  surveys  of  the  \narea     and     increased     “official”     \ncompliance inspections. \n• Increased enforcement actions. \n \nImplementation \n• Urban retrofit. \n• New development. \n \nSource: MDEQ. \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nMDEQ  inspectors  have  conducted  a  significant  number  of  Compliance  Evaluation  \nInspections  (CEIs)  at  sites  in  the  Ross  Barnett  Reservoir  with  large  construction  \nstormwater  general  permits.  In  addition,  MDEQ  conducted  “windshield  surveys”  to  \ndocument the condition and effectiveness of management practices before, during, and \nafter   storm   events.   Pollutant   loads   for   properly   versus   improperly   functioning   \nmanagement practices were not quantified. Literature values must be used to estimate \nthe  overall  effectiveness  of  best  management  practice  (BMP)  systems  installed  on  a  \nconstruction or surface mine site (Edwards 2003). \n \n• Sites with insufficient\n BMPs averaged 11,000 mg/L total suspended solids (TSS) in \nrunoff. \n• Sites with sufficient\n BMPs averaged 600 mg/L TSS in runoff. \n \nCEIs conducted in 2008 through 2010 found violations at 20 of the 38 sites inspected \n(53% of the sites). According to MDEQ personnel, the majority of these violations have \nbeen  corrected,  and  developers  have  improved  BMP  installation  and  maintenance.  It  \ncan  be  assumed  that  less  than  10%  of  construction  and  mine  sites  will  have  \ninsufficient BMPs if the program continues with the same level of effort. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nCost \nCosts for MDEQ include personnel involved in the Ross Barnett Reservoir Stormwater \nCompliance  Initiative,  as  well  as  time  and  equipment  for  inspections  and  follow-up  \nenforcement actions. \n \nCosts  for  developers  include  the  design,  installation,  and  maintenance  of  practices  \naccording to MDEQ requirements. This will vary based on the characteristics of each \nsite (weather conditions, soil conditions, slopes, existing vegetation). \n \nBenefits \n• Reduced sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants in construction site and surface \nmine runoff. \n• Improved   understanding   of   the   importance   of   BMPs   among   developers   and   \ncontractors. \n• Improved   relationships   among   local   stormwater   enforcement   officials   and   \ndevelopers/contractors. \n \nLimitations \n• Site inspections are time-consuming. \n• Inspections not conducted on construction sites smaller than 1 acre. \n \nMaintenance \nEfforts in the past few years have resulted in improved compliance among developers. \nMDEQ personnel feel as if many of the previously  identified  “hot  spots”  have  been  \naddressed.   Continued   presence   of   MDEQ   personnel   will   be   important   when   \ndevelopment increases with an improved economy. \n \nReferences \nMore  information  pertaining  to  construction  stormwater  and  surface  mine  BMP  \nenforcement  is  available  in  Mississippi’s  Phase  II  Small  Municipal  Separate  Storm  \nSewer  System  (MS4)  Guidance  Manual  and  the  Planning  and  Design  Manual  for  the  \nControl  of  Erosion,  Sediment,  and  Storm  Water,  Volume  1:  Erosion  and  Sediment  \nControl   Manual.

All of this construction can increase \nerosion and sediment loading to forest land streams and downstream waterbodies. To \nreduce  the  potential  for  these  water  quality  impacts,  guidelines  have  been  developed  \nfor  siting,  constructing,  maintaining,  and  closing  trails,  roads,  and  landings.  These  \nguidelines  also  include  recommendations  for  structural  erosion  control  measures,  \nincluding  cross  drains,  water  turnouts,  slash  dispersal,  revegetation,  silt  fences  and  \nhay   bales,   water   bars,   outslopes,   broad-based   drainage   ditches,   and   bank   \nstabilization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Mississippi’s BMPs: Best Management Practices for Forestry in Mississippi(MFC 2008). \n \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Recommendations  differ  slightly  for  temporary  and  permanent  trails,  roads,  and  \nstream crossings. \n• When  forest  operations  occur  in  wetlands,  best  management  practices  (BMPs)  \nrelated to trails and roads are federally mandated. \n \n \n\n \n \n• Slope  of  the  land  and  soil  characteristics  influence  recommendations  for  siting,  \nconstruction,  maintenance,  closing  and  BMPs  for  trails,  roads,  stream  crossings,  \nand landings. \n• The grade of the trail or road influences BMP specifications. \n• Siting of trails, roads, and landings should be such that they efficiently serve their \nintended   purpose,   and   facilitate   adequate   control   of   runoff,   erosion,   and   \nsedimentation. \n• Detailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  skid  trails  and  landings  are  \navailable   in   Mississippi’s   BMPs:   Best   Management   Practices   for   Forestry   in   \nMississippi.

Streamside  management  zones  (SMZs)  protect  \nwater quality by providing bank stability and acting as a filter for sediment, nutrients, \nand other chemicals. Requirements for forestry activities within the SMZ are designed \nto  reduce  the  potential  for  damage  to  stream  channels  due  to  tree  removal  and  road  \ncrossings. The SMZ should provide sufficient canopy cover to maintain shade, protect \nthe streambank, and filter pollutants from stormwater. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Recommended     SMZ     width     \nbased      on      whether      the      \nwaterbody   is   a   perennial   or   \nintermittent     stream,     or     a     \nwetland. \n• Because  the  outflow  of  Ross  \nBarnett Reservoir is a perennial \nstream, the recommended SMZ \nwidth      for      the      reservoir      \nshoreline  is  the  same  as  for  a  \nperennial stream. \n• Soil characteristics and slope of \nthe    land    adjacent    to    the    \nwaterbody  affect  recommended  \nSMZ width. \n• SMZs   are   not   required   for   \ndrains  (ephemeral  streams  and  \ngullies). \nSource: Alabama’s Best Management Practices for Forestry\n(Alabama Forestry Commission 2007). \n• Some  forestry  activities  recommended  for  the  SMZ  vary  based  on  whether  the  \nwaterbody is a perennial or intermittent stream, or a wetland. \n• Detailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  streamside  management  zones  \nare  available  in  Mississippi’s  BMPs:  Best  Management  Practices  for  Forestry  in  \nMississippi.

In  disturbed  wetland  areas,  replanting  is  recommended  to  preserve  \nwetland vegetation and prevent conversion of the wetland to a non-wetland. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Site  preparation  may  be  necessary  where  \nsoils  are  compacted,  or  undesirable  plant  \nspecies are present. \n• Soil  amendment  may  be  necessary  where  \nsoils are inadequate to support vegetation. \n• Mulching   improves   erosion   control   while   \nvegetation is becoming established. \n• MFC   recommends   replanting   with   native   \nwetland   vegetation   in   disturbed   wetland   \nareas. \n• Species  recommendations  vary  depending  \non the site conditions and the time of year. \n• Machine- or hand-planting can be used. \n• In wetland areas, appropriate herbicides can \nbe used to control competing plant species. \n• Detailed design information and requirements for artificial vegetation regeneration \nare  available  in  Mississippi’s  BMPs:  Best  Management  Practices  for  Forestry  in  \nMississippi.

Residue  management  is  not  a  practice  \neligible  for  NRCS  Environmental  Quality  Incentives  Program  (EQIP)  funding;  however  \nthe  2011  EQIP  payment  schedule  gives  the  cost  for  residue  management  of  winter  \nannuals and vegetables as $40.50 per acre. \n \nMany  researchers  report  cost  savings  to  producers  as  a  result  of  reduced  machinery  \nuse, increased yield, and reduced inputs. Factors that affect the economics of residue \nmanagement include: \n \n• Changes in machinery and labor operating costs. \n• Changes in herbicide application. \n• Differences  in  crop  yields  and  yield  variability,  and  associated  changes  in  harvest  \nand hauling costs. \n• Improved product quality resulting from reduced plant stress. \n• Changes in land rental charges. \n• Changes in management time and skills. \n \nBenefits \n• Reduced sheet and rill erosion. \n• Reduced nutrients and other chemicals in runoff. \n• Reduced runoff volume. \n• Increased water infiltration. \n• Increased soil moisture. \n• Improved soil organic content, structure, and productivity. \n• Reduced machinery and labor use. \n• Improved crop yield. \n• Reduced air pollution (from reduced machinery use and wind erosion). \n• Reduced input costs. \n• Reduced incidence of some insect pests. \n• Increased incidence of predatory insects. \n• Reduced incidence some plant diseases. \n• Food and escape cover for wildlife. \n \nLimitations \n• There may be no improvement in crop yield. \n• Increased nutrient leaching. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n• Increased weed germination. \n• Increased use of herbicide to control weeds. \n• Emergence of herbicide-resistant weeds. \n• Increased incidence of some plant diseases. \n• May require specialized equipment. \n• Requires more detailed management. \n• May require learning new skills and techniques. \n \nMaintenance \nMaintenance  involves  use  of  the  appropriate  harvest,  till,  and  planting  practices  to  \nmaintain the desired amount of crop residue on the field. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nEPA.  1993.

As a result, grade stabilization structures control erosion, enhance \nenvironmental  quality,  and  reduce  pollution  hazards.  Grade  stabilization  structures  \ninclude  embankment  or  pond-sized  dams;  drop,  chute,  and  box  inlet  drop  spillways;  \nisland-type structures; and side-inlet drainage structures. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Usually   installed   as   part   of   a   \nvegetated runoff control system. \n• Differences   in   adjoining   channel   \ndepths    and    widths,    and    spoil    \ndisposal need to be addressed. \n• There may be a need for emergency \nflow bypass. \n• Stability       of       channel       sides       \ninfluences structure design. \nessary if structures are installed in areas used by livestock, or \nnstream  water  quality,  and  the  impacts  of  these  \n(NRCS)  and  online  at  \nhttp://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/standards/nhcp.html\n• Structures  need  to  be  designed  to  \naccommodate  expected  outlet  flow  \nvolume and velocity. \n• Different   structures   act   on   the   \nlandscape differently. \n• Each  structure  type  has  its  own  \ncriteria          and          construction          \nspecifications. \n• Structures must be designed to have appropriate sediment storage capacity. \n• Fencing may be nec\nin urban areas. \n• The  potential  of  these  structures  to  change  runoff  volume  and  rate,  groundwater  \nrecharge  and  water  table  level,  soil  moisture,  the  susceptibility  of  downstream  \nchannels  to  erosion,  and  dow\nchanges must be considered. \n• Temporary runoff and sediment control may be required during construction. \n• Detailed design information and requirements for grade stabilization structures are \navailable  in  the  National  Conservation  Practice  Standards.

Construction costs include site preparation, excavation, \nfill placement, construction materials, and revegetation of the construction site. There \nmay  also  be  labor  costs  associated  with  maintaining  the  structure,  as  well  as  repair  \ncosts. \n \nBenefits \n• Reduced runoff volumes and peak flows. \n• Slower runoff velocities. \n• Reduced erosion. \n• Reduced sediment and associated pollutants in runoff. \n• Improved downstream channel stability, aquatic habitat, and water quality. \n• Increased soil moisture, groundwater recharge, and/or water table level. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nLimitations \n• Maintenance is required to sustain effectiveness. \n• Potential  for  negative  impacts  downstream  due  to  changes  in  flow,  soil  moisture,  \ngroundwater recharge, or water table level. \n• Can  be  complex  to  design  so  downstream  flow,  channel  stability,  and  aquatic  \nhabitat are not negatively affected. \n \nMaintenance \nInspect the structure periodically, and after major storms, looking for: \n \n• Piping, erosion, or settling of fill around structure. \n• Damage to any protective vegetation. \n• Scouring in channel at structure inlet or outlet. \n• Debris or sediment in the channel or structure that interfere with its function. \n• Cracking of concrete. \n• Erosion in emergency by-pass areas. \n \nMake repairs as needed. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nEPA.  1993.

Field borders can be used as turn rows for \nfarm machinery, to filter runoff, and as wildlife habitat. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Minimum  recommended  border  widths  \nrange  from  20  to  35  feet,  depending  on  \nfarm machinery to be used in the field. \n• At   least   75%   ground   cover   must   be   \nestablished in the border during the first \ngrowing season. \n• Borders  can  be  sized  and  planted  to  act  \nas wildlife habitat. \n• Water bars or berms may be required to \ndistribute or redirect concentrated runoff \nflows. \n• Borders  can  be  planted  or  seeded  with  \nselected grasses and/or clovers, or native \nplants  can  be  allowed  to  establish  in  the  \nborders naturally. \nSource: Missouri Agricultural Extension Service \n• Trapping  efficiency  can  be  increased  by  including  a  3-  to  5-foot  strip  of  Alamo  \nswitchgrass at the edge of the field. \n• Detailed design information and requirements for field borders are available in the \nNational  Conservation  Practice  Standards.  This  publication  is  available  from  the  \nNatural      Resources      Conservation      Service      (NRCS)      and      online      at      \nhttp://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/standards/nhcp.html\n. \n \nImplementation \n• Around crop fields. \n• Between fields and forest. \n• Between fields and buffers. \n• Between fields and recreation areas. \n \n \n \n\n \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nField borders can act as filter strips. \n \nPollutant Efficiency \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) 40%  \nTotal Nitrogen 30% \nTotal Phosphorus 35% \nMetals                                                       Insufficient                                                       data                                                       \nPathogens (fecal coliform, E. coli)               Insufficient               data               \n \nApplicability in Reservoir Watershed \nField crops are grown in approximately 1% of the watershed. \n \nCost \nNRCS  assigns  a  cost  of  around  $200  per  acre  for  establishment  of  filter  strips  under  \nthe  Environmental  Quality  Incentives  Program  (EQIP).  Establishing  field  borders  is  \nsimilar  to  establishing  a  filter  strip.  The  estimated  maintenance  costs  for  filter  strips  \nare roughly $865 per hectare ($350 per acre) per year. \n \nBenefits \n• Reduced runoff volumes and peak flows. \n• Reduced runoff velocities. \n• Reduced erosion. \n• Reduced sediment and nutrients in field runoff. \n• Food and cover for wildlife. \n \nLimitations \n• Variability in pollutant removal efficiencies, depending on design. \n• Filtering is most effective with gentle slopes (less than 6%). \n• Improper grading can greatly diminish pollutant removal. \n• Requires changes in field machine operation. \n• Careful management and maintenance are required for sustained performance and \nlongevity. \n \nMaintenance \n• Inspect field borders periodically. \n• Reshape and/or reseed areas of the border damaged by storms, chemicals, tillage, \nand equipment. \n• Remove sediment when 6 inches has accumulated at the field/border edge. \n• Shut off sprayers and raise tillage equipment when in the border. \n• Fertilize, mow, and control noxious weeds as needed to maintain plant vigor. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n• Fill and reseed any rills or gullies that form in the border. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nAlabama  Soil  and  Water  Conservation  Committee.  2009.

IPM    combines    \nbiological,  cultural,  and  other  alternatives  to  chemical  \ncontrol  with  the  planned  use  of  pesticides  to  keep  pest  \npopulations   below   damaging   levels,   while   minimizing   \nharmful  effects  of  pest  control  on  humans  and  natural  \nresources.  The  practice  is  site-specific  in  nature,  based  \non   approaches   suited   for   the   particular   crop   or   \nlandscape, pest, and location. \n \nDesign Considerations \n• Mulching  can  be  used  to  prevent  weeds  where  turf  is  \nabsent,  fencing  installed  to  keep  rodents  out,  and  \nnetting  used  to  keep  birds  and  insects  away  from  \nleaves and fruit. \nSource: MSU. \n• Visible  insects  can  be  removed  by  hand  (with  gloves  or  tweezers)  and  placed  in  \nsoapy water or vegetable oil. Alternatively, insects can be sprayed off the plant with \nwater or in some cases vacuumed off of larger plants. \n• Store-bought  traps,  such  as  species-specific,  pheromone-based  traps  or  colored  \nsticky cards, can be used. \n• Slugs  can  be  trapped  in  small  cups  filled  with  beer  that  are  set  in  the  ground  so  \nthe slugs can get in easily. \n• In  cases  where  microscopic  parasites,  such  as  bacteria  and  fungi,  are  causing  \ndamage  to  plants,  the  affected  plant  material  can  be  removed  and  disposed  of  \n(pruning  equipment  should  be  disinfected  with  bleach  to  prevent  spreading  the  \ndisease organism). \n• Small  mammals  and  birds  can  be  excluded  using  fences,  netting,  and  tree  trunk  \nguards. \n• Beneficial  organisms,  such  as  bats,  birds,  green  lacewings,  ladybugs,  praying  \nmantis,  ground  beetles,  parasitic  nematodes,  trichogramma  wasps,  seed  head  \nweevils, and spiders that prey on detrimental pest species can be promoted. \n• Detailed  design  information  and  requirements  for  integrated  pest  management  \npractices  are  available  in  the  National  Conservation  Practice  Standards.  This  \npublication  is  available  from  the  Natural  Resources  Conservation  Service  (NRCS)  \nand online at http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/standards/nhcp.html\n. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nImplementation \nIPM  must  be  implemented  on  a  voluntary  basis  by  private  landowners.  It  could  be  \nincorporated into landscape management policy at the municipal or county level. \n \nPollutant Removal Efficiency \nPollutant  removal  efficiency  depends  on  the  actual  practices  used  by  the  individuals.  \nOveruse  and  misuse  of  pesticides  are  common  in  urban  areas.  Use  of  IPM  has  the  \npotential to reduce pesticides transported in urban stormwater. \n \nApplicability in Reservoir Watershed \nThis practice could be used in residential areas and by owners of cropland. \n \nCost \nCost would vary depending on site-specific practices. The cost of alternative methods \nmay  be  less  than  the  cost  of  purchasing  traditional  chemical  pesticides.  Crop  \nproducers  would  need  to  consider  the  risk  of  the  potential  for  some  crop  loss  due  to  \ninsects. \n \nReferences \nInformation in the factsheet is adapted from: \n \nMississippi State University. 2007. “Financial Incentives for IPM” [web page].

Local policies can promote the use of green \ninfrastructure by treating it as the “standard practice” rather than an alternative design. Local \ngovernments interested in promoting green infrastructure could begin by reviewing their current \npolicies. As an initial step, governments in the Reservoir watershed can compare their policies to \nthe Checklist of Recommended Elements to Promote Green Infrastructure (Table O.1).Table O.1 \nincludes recommended elements for stream buffers; green spaces; construction site erosion and \nsediment control; and post-construction stormwater management. Based on review of this \nchecklist, local leaders may find that existing ordinances and zoning codes incorporate many of \nthe recommended elements. The checklist may also help local leaders identify opportunities to \nenhance ordinances to promote green infrastructure and improve water quality. For example, \nsome cities near the Reservoir require preservation of a buffer zone with woody vegetation along \ntributaries and drainage channels in new developments. \nIn some cases, local leaders may want to enhance zoning requirements to promote green \ninfrastructure. Current zoning codes for areas near the Reservoir specify requirements for open \nspace (requirements vary from 5% to 20% depending on the zone). However, existing zoning \ncodes do not include requirements for green space, open space with undisturbed vegetation, or \nopen space replanted with woody vegetation. These types of “open space” are more desirable as \nelements of green infrastructure. \n\nAppendix O  \nGreen Infrastructure Resources October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nO-2 \nTable O.1.

There is no “one-size-fits-all” solution for stormwater management. Policies that work \nwell must be developed from within each individual government by leaders who know the \npersonnel, funding, and level of technical expertise available to enforce ordinances and manage \nthe permit approval process. Each area has unique physical characteristics (topography, climate, \nsoil types) and local culture (individual beliefs, common practices, and customs) that must be \nconsidered when developing enforceable mechanisms.  \nThe successful development of policies to promote use of green infrastructure requires a \nlong-term approach that involves government officials, developers, and the general public. The \napproach recommended for the Reservoir watershed is summarized below and described in more \ndetail in the Comprehensive Education and Outreach Plan for Rezonate! (FTN 2011). The \napproach includes the following action items: \n \n1. Educate local leaders and citizens about green infrastructure and show success \nthrough locally led demonstration projects. \n2. Form a workgroup that includes developers, contractors, and representatives from \nlocal governments to discuss technical elements of green infrastructure and build \nconsensus on its use.  \n3. Reach a broad audience with the use of a media campaign to build support of the \nuse of green infrastructure among the general public.  \n4. Compare existing ordinances and zoning codes to model ordinances and technical \nguidance. Consider what rules need to be changed. Identify the “road blocks” that \nlimit the use of green infrastructure and how they can be changed. Develop a set \nof engineering and technical requirements for incorporating green infrastructure \npractices into local ordinances.  \n5. Work with local elected officials to make the specific ordinance and zoning code \nchanges.  \n \nMany references and publications have been developed to educate local leaders and \ncitizens about green infrastructure. These publications are intended to assist local governments \n\nAppendix O  \nGreen Infrastructure Resources October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nO-5 \nassess their level of support for green infrastructure and make needed improvements to \nordinances, comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, and standards for street and road design. \nPublications recommended for local governments in the Reservoir watershed are described \nbelow: \n \n• Water Quality Scorecard\n3\n  \nThis scorecard offers policy options for protecting and improving water quality \nacross different scales of land use and across multiple municipal departments. \nEPA’s Water Quality Scorecard was developed to help local governments identify \nopportunities to remove barriers, and revise and create codes, ordinances, and \nincentives for better water quality protection. It addresses five key areas: \n1) preserve natural resources (including trees) and open space; 2) promote \nefficient, compact developments, and infill; 3) design complete, smart streets, and \nreduce overall imperviousness; 4) encourage efficient provision of parking, and \n5) adopt green infrastructure stormwater management provisions. The scorecard \ndescribes alternative policy or ordinance information that, when implemented, \nwould support a comprehensive green infrastructure approach. \n \n• Sustainable Design and Green Building Toolkit for Local Governments\n4\n \nSustainable design includes considering not just how buildings and the \nsurrounding site are constructed, but also where they are constructed. EPA has \nmany resources for local governments and the real estate industry on smart \ngrowth: compact, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use development that takes \nadvantage of existing infrastructure and protects critical natural lands.  \nThis document provides guidance for local governments to help them change their \nexisting ordinances and permitting processes to allow/promote sustainable design \nand smart buildings. There are often barriers in existing ordinances to prevent \ndevelopers from taking full advantage of green infrastructure practices for \nstormwater management. This document offers suggestions to overcome those \nbarriers with an appropriate action plan. The action plan can help communities \nimplement necessary regulatory and permitting changes to allow for more \nsustainable design. \n \n                                                \n \n3\nhttp://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/water_scorecard.htm  \n4\n www.epa.gov/smartgrowth \n\nAppendix O  \nGreen Infrastructure Resources October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nO-6 \n• Essential Smart Growth Fixes for Urban and Suburban Zoning Codes\n5\n \nThis publication recognizes common road blocks to green infrastructure in zoning \ncodes. Suggestions on how to remove road blocks and allow more sustainable \ndevelopment practices are included. \n \n• The Southeast Tennessee Green Infrastructure Handbook for Local Governments\n6\n \nThis publication was developed by the Southeastern Tennessee Development \nDistrict with input from local governments. It describes various green \ninfrastructure techniques useful at the community, street, and individual site \nscales. The handbook features local examples, colorful photographs, and an \neye-catching layout. \n \n• Better Site Design: A Handbook for Changing Development Rules in Your \nCommunity\n7\n \nThe Center for Watershed Protection has developed a set of urban design \nprinciples called Better Site Design (BSD). BSD includes 21 specific \nrecommendations for street design, open space preservation, and stormwater \nmanagement. The majority of these principles are consistent with green \ninfrastructure. \n \n• Model ordinances for stormwater management, landscaping, and clearing and \ngrading \nNational examples are available from EPA\n8\n and the Center for Watershed \nProtection\n9\n. \nLocal ordinances adopted by the City of Hernando, Mississippi\n10\n, and Desoto \nCounty, Mississippi\n11\n, have been highly successful and are good examples of \ngreen infrastructure requirements that are working well within Mississippi. \n \n                                                 \n5\n www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/essential_fixes.htm \n6\n http://www.sedev.org/downloads/GreenInfrastructureHandbook.pdf \n7\n http://www.cwp.org/ \n8\n http://www.epa.gov/owow/NPS/ordinance/stormwater.htm \n9\n http://www.cwp.org/ \n10\n http://www.cityofhernando.org/  \n11\n http://www.desotoms.com/departments/environmental-services/stormwater  \n\nAppendix O  \nGreen Infrastructure Resources October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nO-7 \n• Delaware’s Inland Bays Pollution Control Strategy\n12\n  \nThe Inland Bays Pollution Control Strategy recommends three main regulatory \nstrategies to reduce nonpoint source pollutants from urban areas: 1) buffers, \n2) stormwater controls, and 3) wastewater treatment. Voluntary measures are \nrecommended for agricultural areas. \n                                                \n \n12\n http://www.dnrec.state.de.us/water2000/sections/watershed/ws/ib_pcs.htm  \n\nAppendix O  \nGreen Infrastructure Resources October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nO-8 \n3.0 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLANS \n \nUrban areas in the Reservoir watershed designated as municipal separate storm sewer \nsystems (MS4s) have developed Stormwater Management Plans (MS4 Plans). These areas are \nRankin County, City of Flowood, Madison County, City of Madison, and City of Ridgeland. The \nfollowing list includes suggestions to enhance existing MS4 Plans in the Reservoir watershed. \nThese suggested actions are voluntary, but could significantly improve stormwater management \nin the watershed if incorporated by local stormwater managers.  \n \n1. Monitor and track properties that need improved stormwater management by \ndeveloping an inventory of locations with insufficient stormwater controls \n(i.e., parking lots and subdivisions that were designed with insufficient \nstormwater management and areas where repairs or maintenance are needed). \nContact landowners and encourage them to voluntarily improve stormwater \nmanagement on their properties.  \n2. Identify specific locations where active bank failures or knickpoints are visible \nwithin stream systems. Also identify locations of actively eroding gullies in \nupland areas. Work with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n(MDEQ) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to install \nmanagement practices to correct the problems noted at these locations. \n3. Include a listing of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) within the regulated \narea. Review the pollutant reduction requirements for TMDL waters. Include \nprovisions to take action towards meeting pollutant reduction goals. Coordinate \nwith MDEQ Basin Managers on these actions. \n4. Create a regional stormwater management consortium comprised of \nrepresentatives from city and county governments within the watershed. The \nconsortium would improve communication and collaboration among governments \nin the Reservoir watershed. Some requirements for public education and outreach \nand public participation could be satisfied through participation in the Rezonate \nInitiative. This would result in consistent programs for the watershed and \npotential cost savings by sharing training events and materials.  \n5. Institute a certification program for contractors and developers such as the \nCertified Professional in Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC) program.\n13\n  \n                                                 \n13\n www.cpesc.org \n\nAppendix O  \nGreen Infrastructure Resources October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nO-9 \n6. Establish a buffer zone designated for limited development in selected areas \naround the Reservoir and along contributing streams. This would allow vegetative \nfiltering of stormwater runoff entering these waterbodies as well as bank \nprotection.  \n7. Improve development and implementation of Stormwater Pollution Prevention \nPlans (SWPPPs) for individual construction sites within the watershed. The \nEnvironmental Compliance and Enforcement Division at MDEQ should continue \nto review SWPPPs. The Pearl River Valley Water Supply District (PRVWSD) \nshould also have the option to review and comment on SWPPPs for construction \npermits issued within their lease land. Consider a requirement for an onsite \n“pre-construction meeting” to take place after erosion and sediment controls have \nbeen implemented but before any land-disturbing activities have begun. This \nwould allow the jurisdictional authority to ensure that the controls are in place and \nproperly installed.  \n8. Encourage contractors/developers to inspect construction sites following any \nsignificant rain event (i.e., greater than 0.25 inch in a 24-hour period) and \nimplement corrective action for any needed maintenance. Documents of routine \ncontractor self-inspections should be available to a city/county inspector upon \nrequest. \n9. Improve stormwater conveyance system maps developed by cities/counties. Maps \nare required for MS4 Plans; however, the features displayed are typically limited \nto major stormwater outfalls and publicly owned areas (i.e., city parks). \nEncourage development of a more comprehensive map that includes stormwater \nmanagement features (swales, retention/detention ponds, open space, and \ninfiltration/bioretention areas). Also identify on these maps, waterbodies and \ncritical resource areas such as wetlands, aquifer recharge areas, and source water \nprotection areas.  \n10. Provide incentives for developers to utilize green infrastructure, minimize \nimpervious areas, and use infiltration and/or other design considerations to \nimprove post-construction stormwater management. Incentives for redeveloping \nexisting properties are needed to encourage retrofits.  \n11. Allow offsite, regional water retention/detention in certain cases (such as retrofits \nof developed areas that lie in high-density urban zones). This will avoid costly \nonsite retention in densely developed infill areas and provide benefit to priority \nretrofit sites.  \n \n\nAppendix O  \nGreen Infrastructure Resources October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nO-10 \n4.0 MANAGEMENT MEASURES \n \nSelected green infrastructure management measures that are recommended for use in the \nReservoir watershed are described below. The text includes information on how and where these \npractices would be most effective. Appendix N to the Comprehensive Protection and Restoration \nPlan includes fact sheets that give design specifications for these practices. \n \n4.1      Bioretention      Areas      \nBioretention areas can be installed in landscaped areas and designed to connect to \nexisting stormwater infrastructure systems within the developed and urbanized area of the \nwatershed. In addition to retrofitting, they can be incorporated into the design of the stormwater \nmanagement system of proposed developments. They can be installed in any soil type; however, \nif installed in a low-permeability soil (types C and D), the bioretention basins should be designed \nwith underdrain systems connecting to the downstream best management practices (BMPs) or \noutfall. In such situations, bioretention basins can still be used to treat the stormwater by \nremoving suspended solids, nutrients, and pollutants and then discharging the stormwater, with \nmuch lower total suspended solids (TSS) and pollutant loads into other parts of the stormwater \nconveyance system such as bioswales or a stormwater pond. Small bioretention areas installed by \nproperty owners on individual lots are called rain gardens. \n \n4.2 Stormwater Retention Ponds \nStormwater retention ponds (also called wet ponds or wet-extended detention ponds) are \ncommonly used to collect stormwater in developed areas. MDEQ requires that construction sites \nlarger than 10 acres install a sediment basin. These basins are often converted to permanent \nstormwater ponds after construction is complete. Stormwater retention ponds remove pollutants \nthrough settling and biological uptake. Pollutant removal performance of wet ponds is typically \nmuch greater than that of dry detention ponds. Dry detention basins fail to demonstrate an ability \nto meet the majority of water quality goals, are prone to clogging and resuspension of previously \nsettled solids,\n\n and require a higher frequency of maintenance than wet ponds. \n\nAppendix O  \nGreen Infrastructure Resources October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nO-11 \nStormwater retention ponds require a significant amount of space, which can be a \nlimiting factor in retrofitting. Some cities have allowed sharing of stormwater retention ponds \n(Flowood and Madison). Shared stormwater retention ponds reduce construction costs and allow \nfor a large enough contributing drainage area to maintain desired pool elevations in wet ponds. \n \n4.3      Constructed      Wetlands      \nConstructed stormwater wetlands are another option for managing stormwater. These \nsystems are highly recommended because they are among the most effective stormwater \ntreatment practices in terms of pollutant removal, and also offer aesthetic value and wildlife \nhabitat. Constructed wetlands have limitations due to land requirements and costs (typically \n25% higher than stormwater ponds). Constructed stormwater wetlands work best in soils that \nhave water holding capacity (types C and D). \n \n4.4 Streamside Buffer Zones \nStreamside buffer zones (also called riparian buffers) are natural or constructed low-\nmaintenance ecosystems adjacent to surface waterbodies, where trees, grasses, shrubs, and \nherbaceous plants function as a filter to remove pollutants from overland stormwater flow prior \nto discharge to receiving waters, and they function to stabilize banks. Maintaining a vegetated \nbuffer or setback along creeks, streams, and rivers provides an attractive landscape and can \nimprove water quality by removing sediment and chemicals before they reach the waterway. In \naddition, buffers provide flood control, help recharge groundwater, prevent soil erosion, and \npreserve or improve certain types of wildlife habitat. \nRegulatory controls to prevent disturbance of riparian buffer zones near perennial streams \nare an important protection strategy for the Reservoir watershed. MDEQ’s Large Construction \nStorm Water General Permit (issued January 2011) recommends maintaining a 150-ft buffer \nzone between the land disturbance and any perennial waterbody\n14\n. EPA has proposed a new \ngeneral National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for discharges from \nconstruction activities. If approved, this permit would require a 50-ft buffer of undisturbed \n                                                \n \n14\n http://deq.state.ms.us/MDEQ.nsf/page/epd_epdgeneral?OpenDocument \n\nAppendix O  \nGreen Infrastructure Resources October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nO-12 \nnatural vegetation between the disturbed areas of a construction site and any water of the state. In \nlieu of a buffer zone, the developer will be required to provide sediment and erosion controls that \nachieve the equivalent pollution load reduction of a 50-ft buffer\n15\n. \n \n4.5      Level      Spreaders      \nLevel spreaders are used to distribute concentrated runoff onto vegetated areas (restored \nriparian buffers and open space), so that it can be treated via infiltration and evaporation. Since it \nuses infiltration to treat stormwater, this practice works best in areas with type B soils. \n \n4.6 Vegetated Filter Strips and Water Quality Swales \nVegetated filter strips provide treatment for stormwater running off parking lots and other \nimpervious areas. In areas where slopes permit and water velocities are slow enough to prevent \nscouring, water quality swales or grassed swales should be used to convey stormwater in place of \nconcrete structures. Water quality swales are more expensive to build and maintain than grassed \nswales, but have higher pollutant removal rates than grassed swales. \n \n4.7      Cluster      Development      \nCounty zoning ordinances in Madison and Rankin Counties allow cluster development in \nareas zoned as Planned Urban Development (PUD) districts. PUDs allow for reduced length of \nroads and utility rights-of-way through clustering of housing. PUD districts are superimposed \nover residential developments and must maintain the density requirements of the residential zone \nover which they are imposed. However, minimum lot size and width can be reduced and \nremaining land reserved in contiguous tracts of common open space for use by residents. The \nrequirement in Rankin County is that 20% of the developed area be preserved as common open \nspace.\n16\n However, there are no restrictions on the amount of this area that must be kept as green \nspace. \n \n                                                \n \n15\n http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/cgp.cfm \n16\n Zoning Ordinance of Rankin County, Mississippi 2004.

Upland sources can be attributed to land management activities that \nresult in removal of natural vegetation and lead to erosion of exposed sediments from \nconstruction sites, surface mining, forest harvesting, and agricultural activities. Land \ndevelopment removes natural vegetation and increases impervious surface areas results in \nreduced infiltration and increased peak flows in urban streams. This leads to erosion of stream \nbanks and resuspension of stream bed sediments. \nA preliminary sediment budget has been developed for the Mill-Pelahatchie Creek \nwatershed as delineated by US Geological Survey (USGS) 12-digit hydrologic unit code \n(HUC12). The sediment budget was based on watershed modeling and available monitoring data. \nThe budget can be used to guide management practices and manage expectations related to \nsediment reductions expected from implementation of practices. This sediment budget should be \nconsidered preliminary because it is based on many simplifying assumptions. The budget was \ndeveloped for annual average conditions. Thus, it does not reflect temporal variation in sediment \nloads (i.e., the large amount of sediment movement that occurs during high-flow events). Also \nthe budget does not consider differences in sediment particle size, which can be used as an \nindicator of the sediment source. Sediments from the upland watershed are typically fine-grained \nsediments (silts and clays), while sediments from stream beds are typically larger (sands and \ngravels). Larger sediments often take many years to move downstream through a stream system, \nwhile fine materials move through the system quickly.  \nThis sediment budget uses a simplified process to simulate sediment sources (Figure P.1). \nSediment generated from rural areas must travel over land surfaces and within ditches and small \nstream channels before reaching the watershed boundary. Sediments lost during transport are \nreferred to as hillslope storage. The percentage of sediments not deposited as hill slope storage \ncan be estimated as the sediment delivery ratio (SDR). Urban sediment sources include gully \nerosion and construction and surface mining sites. Urban sediments are also subject to hillslope \nstorage. Once reaching the stream, sediments may be subject to aggradation (settling) or \ndegradation (resuspension) based on the flow energy and sediment content of the overlaying \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-2 \nwater. Bank failure may also contribute sediments. The total instream sediment contribution is \nthe sum of degradation and bank failure minus aggradation.  \nThe budget can be summarized by the following equation, where all sediment is \nmeasured in kilograms per year: \n \nMeasured sediment load   =    (rural uplands erosion * SDR) + (gully erosion * SDR) + \n(construction and mine sites erosion * SDR) + instream \ncontribution from bed and banks \n \nIn developing the sediment budget, sediment loads from erosion in rural uplands, gully \nerosion in urban areas, and erosion at construction and surface mining sites were estimated using \nthe methods described in Sections 2.0 through 5.0. The measured sediment load was calculated \nfrom available monitoring data. The instream contribution from bed and banks was estimated as \nthe measured sediment load minus the sum of the sediment loads from rural erosion, gully \nerosion in urban areas, and erosion at construction and surface mining sites. \nThe preliminary sediment budget for the Mill-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12 is shown in \nTable P.1 and on Figure P.2. This budget indicates that the majority of the annual sediment load \nis from instream sources. The second greatest sediment source is rural uplands. Rural upland \nsediments originate from row-crop agriculture, pastures, forest/woodlands, and shrublands.  \n \nTable P.1.

Loads were predicted on a monthly basis for \na 5-year period (2000 through 2005). The GWLF model simulates the hydrologic cycle in a \nwatershed and predicts streamflow based on precipitation, evapotranspiration, land uses, and soil \ncharacteristics (Dai et al. 2000). The model was used to provide monthly estimates of \nstreamflow, soil erosion, and sediment yield. The model is also capable of predicting nutrient \nloads based on loading functions from surface runoff, groundwater, point sources, and septic \nsystems. Nutrients were not predicted in this application of the model. However, this capability \nmay be useful in future applications when sufficient nutrient monitoring data are available. \n \n2.1 GWLF Model Setup \nThe GWLF model uses the universal soil loss equation to (USLE) estimate soil loss from \nrural lands. The sediment yields predicted by the USLE include sheet and rill erosion\n. GWLF \npredicts sediment yields on a monthly basis using the assumption that sediment yields are \nproportional to the amount of runoff. The amount of runoff is computed daily using the Soil \nConservation Service (SCS) curve number equation (Ogrosky & Mockus 1964). An SDR \nestimates the amount of soil generated that actually reaches the streams. Table P.2 gives a \nsummary of the types of input data, sources of the data, and the value used in the GWLF model \nof the Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12. Tables P.3 through P.6 include additional data needed for the \nGWLF model. A summary of the ULSE factors is given in Table P.7.  \n \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-5 \nTable P.2.

Soil \nerodibility is a function of the inherent soil \nproperties, including organic matter content, \nparticle size, permeability, etc. Values of K were \nbased on the State Soil Survey Geographic \n(SSURGO) database. The average v\n\nalue for the \nHUC12 was used in the model. \nThe average value for the HUC12 is \n0.32. \nSlope Length \nFactor (L) and \nSlope Steepness \nFactor (S) \nThe L factor accounts for the effects of slope \nlength on the rate of erosion. The S factor \naccounts for the effects of slope angle on erosion \nrates. An average LS value for the HUC12 was \ncalculated using the 10-meter USGS digital \nelevation model (DEM) using the derived flow \naccumulation and slope of the DEM. The flow \naccumulation and slope were used within the \nfollowing formula to derive the LS for any given \n10-meter pixel: \n1.6 * Pow(([flowacc] * resolution) / 22.1, 0.6) * \nPow(Sin([temporal_slope] * 0.01745) / 0.09, 1.3)\n1\n \nThe 10-meter DEM data were downloaded from \nMaris in August 2010. The DEM was derived \nfrom the USGS 1:24000 contour lines.\n2\n \n \nSupporting documentation for this method is \navailable from the University of Texas.\n3\n \nThe average LS value for the HUC12 \nis 1.4. This value was used for all \nlanduse types, with the exception of \nagricultural crops. \n \nThe LS value for agricultural crops \nwas obtained from consultation with \nthe Natural Resources Conservation \nService (NRCS).\n4\n NRCS suggested \nthat a lower LS value was more \nrealistic for fields in the \nMill-Pelahatchie Creek watershed. An \naverage value of 0.354 was used for \nthe GWLF model. \nCover Management \nFactor (C) \nThe C factor accounts for the influence of soil and \ncover management, such as tillage practices, \ncropping types, crop rotation, and fallow on soil \nerosion rates \nVaries based on landuse type (see \nTable P.4 for details). \n                                                 \n1\n http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.3/index.cfm?id=6335&pid=6312&topicname=Pow \n2\n http://www.maris.state.ms.us/metadata/DEM/10Mdem.htm \n3\n http://www.utexas.edu/depts/grg/hudson/grg360g/EGIS/labs_04/Lab9/lab9_soil_erosion_05.htm \n4\n Personal communication, Murray Fulton, NRCS, Brandon, Mississippi. \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \nTable P.2. Sediment input parameters for GWLF model (continued). \n \n \n \nP-6 \nInput Parameter Explanation/Data Source Input Values \nErosion Control \nFactor (P) \nThe P factor accounts for the influence of support \npractices such as contouring, strip cropping, and \nterracing on soil erosion rates. \nAn assumed value of P=0 was used for \nall landuse types except for \nagricultural crops. P = 0 was used \nbecause no information is known about \nspecific practices on the HUC12 scale. \nThis is a conservative assumption. \n \nNRCS was consulted about the P value \nfor agricultural crops and suggested \nthat P=0.5 was realistic for the Mill-\nPelahatchie watershed. \nEvapotranspiration \nCover Coefficient \n(ET) \nET varies according to land use type and period \nwithin the growing season. The value is usually \nbetween 0 (impervious surfaces) and 1 (e.g., \nwater).  \nThe average value for the HUC12 is \n0.61 during the growing season and \n0.60 during the non-growing season. \n(see Tables P.5 and P.6 for estimates \nduring the growing and non-growing \nseasons). The growing season was \nassumed to be April – October. The \nnon-growing season was assumed to \nbe November – March. \n \n \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-7 \nTable P.3.

For these calculations, a value of 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) was used. This value was \nan estimate used to serve as a place holder until actual data to quantify the length of actively \neroding gullies can be determined. The National Sedimentation Laboratory has recently \ndeveloped remote sensing technology to identify sites with a high potential for ephemeral gully \nformation (Bingner et al. 2010). However, this method has only been applied to agricultural \nfields. A possible method to estimate this with a higher level of certainty would be to use \nlow-level aerial photography\n5\n (available for Rankin County in 2006 and 2008) with \nground-truthing to measure the length of gullies in a small area and extrapolate that value to the \nentire watershed. However, given that the current estimated sediment load from gully erosion \naccounts for such a small percentage of the total load (i.e., 1.1%), it is not expected that using a \nlength of gullies based on measurements would significantly change the proportioning of the \nsediment load among the different sources. So, even with a gully length based on measurements, \nthe estimated load would still be two orders of magnitude less than the total load.  \nThe amount of soil eroded from the sides of gullies was estimated to be 0.46 ton per foot \nper year (1,368.8 kg/m/year). This erosion rate reflects an assumed annual rate of lateral \nadvancement of 1 foot per year and a depth of eroding sides of 5 feet, with both sides eroding. \nThese assumptions result in an average annual soil loss of 5 cubic feet along each foot of gully. \nThe unit weight of soil was assumed to be 0.046 ton per cubic foot. These assumptions are \nconsistent with those used to estimate tons of soil saved through gully stabilization in the Mill \nCreek watershed (Rankin County Board of Supervisors et al. 2009). \n                                                \n \n5\n Available for the Mill Creek watershed from 2006 and from all of Rankin County in 2008. Data were collected by \nthe Rankin County Board of Supervisors. \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-11 \nThe resulting equation used to calculate gully erosion is shown below: \n \nGully erosion = 1,368.8 kg/m/year * 1,000 meters = 1.37E6 kg/year \n \nThe yield from gullies (given in kilograms of total suspended solids [TSS] per year) was \nthen calculated as the product of the erosion and the SDR.

As of December 2010, there were 20 active Large Construction Stormwater \nGeneral Permits\n6\n in the Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12. The area disturbed under each permit could not \nbe easily determined from records, so an average area of 20 acres was assumed.  \nRecords of Small Construction Stormwater General Permits are maintained by the county \ngovernment in which they are located. Rankin County reported 249 sites under the small \nconstruction general permit in 2010. Because records of the site locations were not readily \navailable, it was assumed that 20% of the sites, or 50 sites, were located in the HUC12.\n7\n The \naverage disturbed area associated with small construction sites was assumed to be 5 acres.  \nMDEQ permit records indicate that there are three surface mining sites located in the \nMill-Pelahatchie HUC12. Sizes of the mining sites were also not readily available, however the \npermits in this HUC12 are all “exempt” from office of geology permits. This means that the sites \nare smaller than 4 acres. As a conservative assumption, a size of 4 acres was assigned for the \nthree mines. \nThe size of disturbed areas in the HUC12 was estimated as shown in Table P.10. \n \n                                                \n \n6\n Large Construction General Permit\n\ns are issued for construction sites 5 acres or greater. \n7\nWe first considered an even distribution within Rankin County, based on size of Rankin County (795 square miles \nor 508,800 acres) compared to the size of the Mill-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12 (18,123 acres). 249 construction sites \nper 508,800 acres is equivalent to 9 sites within the HUC12. However, it is known that much of the construction \nactivity is concentrated near the Reservoir in this HUC12, so the even distribution did not seem to be a good \nassumption. \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-13 \nTable P.10. Disturbed areas by construction and mining activity in the watershed. \n \nType Disturbed Area \nLarge Construction Sites 20 sites* 20 acres = 400 acres \nSmall Construction Sites 50 sites * 5 acres = 200 acres \nSurface Mines 3 sites * 4 acres = 12 acres \nTotal \n662 acres (2.68 square kilometers) \n \n4.2 Sediment Concentrations in Runoff \nLiterature values must be used to estimate the amount of sediment contained in \nstormwater runoff from construction and mine sites. The following literature values for runoff \nsediment concentrations were used\n8\n: \n \n• The TSS in runoff from sites with insufficient best management \npractices (BMPs) = 11,000 mg/L. \n• The TSS in runoff from sites with effective BMPs= 637 mg/L. \n \nMDEQ conducted Compliance Evaluation Inspections in 2008 through 2010 and found \nviolations at 20 of the 38 sites inspected near the Reservoir (53% of the sites). From these \ninspections, it was estimated that 50% of the disturbed areas had insufficient BMPs and 50% of \nthe sites had effective BMPs. Using this estimate, the average TSS concentration in disturbed \narea runoff is 5,927 mg/L. \n \n4.3 Runoff from Construction and Mining Sites \nThe GWLF model was used only to calculate the amount of runoff for developed areas. \nSediment loads were not calculated with this model. The amount of runoff from developed areas \nwas calculated by the GWLF model as 40.08 cm/year (1.07E6 m\n3\n/year). Note that the model \ninput for the developed landuse is included in Tables P.2 through P.6. \n                                                \n \n8 \nCalculate erosion per acre using TSS concentrations from Edwards (2003; as cited in ADEQ 2004) assuming that \nhalf of acres have no BMPs (i.e., TSS in runoff is 11,217 mg/L) and the other half have effective BMPs (TSS in \nrunoff is 637 mg/L). \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-14 \n4.4 Estimated Sediment Load from Construction and Mining Sites \nThe amount of erosion from disturbed areas was calculated as follows: \n \nErosion (kg TSS/year) = 1.07E6 m\n3\n/year * 5,927 mg/L = 6.34E6 \n \nThe yield from disturbed areas was then calculated as the product of the erosion and the \nSDR. Results for Mill-Pelahatchie Creek watershed are given below: \n \nAnnual Sediment Yield (kg TSS/year) = 6.34E6 * 0.13 \n \nAnnual Sediment Yield = 8.24E5 kg TSS/year \n \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-15 \n5.0 MEASURED SEDIMENT LOAD \n \nData collected from monitoring stations located in the Mill-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12 \nwas used to calculate the measured sediment load. USGS has monitored flow and suspended \nsediments at several locations in the Mill-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12. Only two stations have \nsimultaneous records of flow and suspended sediments, so that the sediment samples can be \nconverted into instantaneous measurements of sediment load (Table P.11). \n \nTable P.11. Monitoring data summary. \n \nStation Data Availability \nMill Creek at Hwy 25, USGS 02485574 \nDaily flow measurements (1998 – present); \n707 suspended sediment samples with instantaneous \nflow readings (01/2008 – 09/2009) \nMill Creek Tributary 1, USGS 02485577\n1,476 suspended sediment samples with \ninstantaneous flow readings (09/2006 – 08/2010). \n \nLinear regressions were developed relating the log of the flow yield (flow per amount of \ndrainage area) and the log of the suspended sediments yield (suspended sediments load per \namount of drainage area) from both sites. However, only the relationship developed for Mill \nCreek at Highway 25 was used in the final analysis. This is because the sediment yields from \nTributary 1 were elevated due to known compliance problems as a large construction site. The \nyields measured Highway 25 were assumed to be representative of the yields expected in the \nHUC12 subwatershed, and the relationship was used to estimate sediment loads expected for the \nHUC12. It should be noted that the majority of the samples collected at Highway 25 are \nassociated with rain event monitoring.  \nThe linear regression for Mill Creek at Highway 25 was used to calculate the annual \naverage sediment load contributed from land in the Mill-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12 (Figure P.3). \nThe relationship can be expressed with the following equation: \n \nLog(kg suspended sediments/km\n2\n/day) = 1.517 * Log(m\n3\n/sec/km\n2\n) + 5.493 \n \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-16 \n1.00E+00\n1.00E+01\n1.00E+02\n1.00E+03\n1.00E+04\n1.00E+05\n1.00E+06\n1.00E+07\n0.0010.010.1110\nSS\n \nYield\n \n(Kg/Km\n2\n)\nFlow Yield (m\n3\n/sec/Km\n2\n)\nHwy 25\nLog(SS/Km\n2\n)= 1.517Log(m\n3\n/sec/Km\n2\n) + 5.493\nR\n2\n= 0.91\nFigure P.3.

Using the above equation, the estimated \nsediment load is 1.59E7 kg/year for the Mill-Pelahatchie Creek HUC12. Note that this is the \nmeasured sediment load indicated in Table P.1. \n \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-17 \n6.0 CONCLUSIONS \n \nThis analysis indicates that the largest sediment source in the Mill-Pelahatchie is instream \nsources, with smaller contributions coming from rural upland areas, disturbed urban areas, and \ngullies. A reasonable conclusion from this finding is that management measures to stabilize \neroding stream banks and beds are needed to reduce the overall sediment loads in the system. \nHowever, instream management practices alone are not likely to reduce sediment loads enough \nto measurably improve water quality and reach the total maximum daily load (TMDL) goal of a \n“stable sediment yield at the effective discharge.” \nPlans for instream management practices should be developed with an understanding of \nthe geomorphology of the system and possible geomorphic changes in stream channels. Stream \nstabilization measures alone that are installed at selected reaches could alter the energy-sediment \nbalance and cause unintentional erosion problems at other locations. Watershed management \ndecisions, especially the increase of impervious surface area in the watershed, are critical to \npreventing further erosion of stream channels. This is because stream channels in impervious \nwatersheds experience increased peak flows in response to rain events. Increased peak flows are \na direct cause of stream bank and bed erosion. \nFor these reasons, the management practices recommended for the Mill-Pelahatchie \nHUC12 include measures to reduce sediment and peak flows from upland areas along with \ninstream practices. There are several reasons for this: \n \n• The large sediment contribution from stream beds and banks also accounts for \nsediment stored in the stream channels from previous upland activities. Previous \nactivities include historical row-crop agriculture and land development that \noccurred prior to regulation of construction sites. Sediments contributed from \nthese activities are likely to aggregate in quiescent areas of the stream channels \nand floodplains. These sediments can be resuspended during high-flow events and \nflushed downstream. However it is likely to take tens to hundreds of years for this \nprocess to completely wash out existing sediments. \n• Instream management practices can be extremely costly, with establishment of \n“natural” streambank stabilization methods costing as much as $200 per linear \nfoot. Due to the high cost, it is unlikely that resources will be available to install \nthese practices on a large scale. \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-18 \n• Practices that capture and infiltrate storm water flows from impervious surface \nareas within the watershed are highly recommended to reduce erosion-causing \npeak-flow events in the Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12. \n• Preservation and restoration of riparian buffer zones is a highly recommended \nBMP. Riparian buffer zones have many positive benefits to adjacent streams \nincluding stabilization of eroding stream banks and reduction of peak-flow events. \nThis would likely be effective for reducing sediment contributions from stream \nbeds and banks. \n• Management practices placed at headwater locations are less costly to implement, \nand their results often become visible to the public in a shorter amount of time. \nPublic visibility is vital to the success of any watershed restoration project so that \nthe public can “see” the results of their financial investments towards restoring \nand protecting water quality. \n \n\nAppendix P  \nSediment Budget for Mill-Pelahatchie HUC12 Watershed October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nP-19 \n7.0 REFERENCES \n \nADEQ. 2004.

However, attributing cumulative sediment \nloads to individual sources may be difficult without detailed information. Furthermore, \nattributing sources to one particular source over others may be controversial among the effected \ngroups if this is done without adequate supporting information. Within urban areas, for example, \nquantifying sediment due to transport of sediments from construction sites due to sheet flow vs. \ngullies formed in areas with concentrated flows would require site-specific observation of where \nand when these process are occurring. \nMost studies that have attempted to make accurate estimates of instream loads have \nincluded extensive field data collection activities and modeling efforts. A summary of several \nsuch studies is included in Section 2.0. \n \n\nAppendix Q  \nLiterature Review: Sediment Budgets and Source Studies October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nQ-2 \n2.0 SEDIMENT YIELD STUDIES \n \n2.1      James      Creek      \nJames Creek is a tributary of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway located in Level III \nEcoregion 65. Sediment yields were calculated using a combination of methods were used \nincluding empirical analysis of historic data from other sites, field reconnaissance and detailed \ndata collection and surveying, and numerical modeling of uplands and channels. Models \n(AnnAGNPS and CONCEPTS) and direct comparison of channel cross sections measured over \ntime were used to estimate yields. \n“Actual” sediment yields (determined with field data and modeling) were compared with \n“reference” sediment yields for Ecoregion 65. Reference yields were adjusted to account for bed \nmaterial particle size and given as 2.22 tons per day per square kilometer at the Q\n1.5\n flow (the \nhigh-flow condition that is expected statistically to occur once every one and a half years). (Note \nthat this reference yield value is for stable streams). Modeling data predicted actual yield for \nrecent years at the Q\n1.5\n to be 39 tons per day per square kilometer. Annual average yield for \nrecent years calculated with monitoring data is 727 tons per year per square kilometer. (Please \nnote that the annual average yield cannot be compared to reference yields at the Q\n1.5\n because the \nannual average yield is calculated in terms of tons per year, not per day.) \nBased on historical record, sediment yields were 89% from the bed and banks and \n11% from upland sources. High bed and bank sources were attributed to historical stream \nchannel modification, which included clearing with a dragline. More recent years (1970-2002) \nshow that 70% of the sediments originate from banks and 30% are from the watershed. \nManagement practices should focus on stream-channel processes and stabilizing eroding reaches \nand tributaries. \n \n2.2 Town Creek near Tupelo \nThe Mississippi State University (MSU) Department of Civil Engineering, in cooperation \nwith the National Sedimentation Laboratory (NSL), has conducted extensive field work and \nsediment budget calculations on Town Creek near Tupelo. Results indicated that up to 70% of \nthe sediments delivered to the outlet originated in the upper region of the watershed. The \n\nAppendix Q  \nLiterature Review: Sediment Budgets and Source Studies October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nQ-3 \ndrainage area of the upper region constitutes approximately 30% of the total drainage area \n(Ramirez-Avila et al. 2010b). Sources in the upper watershed were gulley erosion from \nagricultural lands and erosion from incised channels. Downstream reaches appeared to be \nstabilizing, and functioned as a zone of deposition due to influence of the Tennessee-Tombigbee \nwaterway (Ramirez-Avila et al. 2010a).  \nAdditional conclusions were as follows: \n \n• Upper reaches appeared to be in the degradation stage (active bank failure and \nchannel widening), based on data analysis and visual observation. Middle and \nlower reaches appeared to be in aggradation; channels are wide and stable with \nthe presence of vegetation (Ramirez-Avila et al. 2010b).  \n• Estimated suspended sediment yield at the Q\n1.5\n flow was 80 tons per day per \nsquare kilometer. This estimate was obtained using the transport curve for \nNettleton, Mississippi. \n• Regional relationships for sediment yield are significantly lower than estimates \nobtained from local data. Reference yield for Ecoregion 65 streams is 3.9 tons per \nday per square kilometer. This is the median value for all sites in Mississippi \ngiven in Simon et al. 2002a. \n• Temporal analysis shows a reduction of sediment loads at baseflow conditions.  \n• Increased loads under higher flow conditions in upper reaches were attributed to \nactive geomorphic processes. \n \nField data collected\n\n for this effort included the following: \n \n• Spatially distributed grab samples at 24 locations; \n• Automatic sampling during storm events at three locations, including analysis of \nriding limb and falling limb samples; \n• Stream bank erosion monitoring by cross-section surveys and erosion pin arrays \n(with analysis of change over time), and \n• Stream bed sediment sampling (Ramirez-Avila 2010). \n \nEfforts to develop correlations between stream bank erosion and physical and \ngeomorphic variables (riparian vegetation, streambank soil saturation, bank height and angle) \nhave not been successful at this point in the research. However, researchers expect to be able to \n\nAppendix Q  \nLiterature Review: Sediment Budgets and Source Studies October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nQ-4 \ndraw some conclusions relating sediment deposition rates to riparian vegetation and geomorphic \nvariables. \n \n2.3      Harland      Creek      \nResearchers studied Harland Creek, a stream located near Yazoo City in the hill region of \nthe Yazoo River Basin. This study described the economic benefits of streambank stabilization \npractices and reduction of phosphorous contributed via bank erosion (Hubbard et al. 2003). \nSediment and associated phosphorus loads were estimated for a selected reach of the creek using \nlateral bank migration rates estimated from an analysis of aerial photographs from 1955, 1973, \n1980, and 1991. Bank heights were estimated from cross sections measured at multiple sites \nalong the study reach. Volumes of sediment eroded from the stream banks were estimated for the \ntime periods between each set of aerial photographs. Phosphorus loads associated with eroded \nstream banks were calculated based on measurements of soil density and phosphorus content. \nSeveral methods of bank protection were installed as part of the Demonstration Erosion \nControl (DEC) project on Harland Creek, including bendway weirs and willow posts. Reductions \nin sediment contributions from bank erosion were estimated by comparing volumes of sediment \nlost before and after the installation of management practices. \n \n2.4 West Fork White River, Arkansas \nThe Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) used Bank Erosion Hazard \nIndex (BEHI) to estimate streambank erosion rates and an annual sediment load due to \nstreambank erosion in the West Fork White River (WFWR). This method uses criteria including \nbank angle, root depth, and bank material. Data also included cross-section surveys of stream \nbanks. Toe pins were used to measure lateral movement of banks. Researchers used a graphical \nmodel based on physical measurements to estimate lateral erosion rates and total sediment \ncontributed from inventoried streambanks. Sediment loads from streambanks averaged 329 tons \nper year per square mile. Authors concluded that 80% of the of the estimated suspended \nsediment load for the watershed resulted from erosion of the streambanks along the main stem of \nthe WFWR that were included in the inventory (Van Eps et al. 2004). \n\nAppendix Q  \nLiterature Review: Sediment Budgets and Source Studies October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nQ-5 \n2.5      Chesapeake      Bay      \nSediment studies conducted throughout Chesapeake Bay watershed have been \nsummarized by a large workgroup in a comprehensive report (US Geological Survey 2003). The \nreport included a review of literature from many authors addressing sediment erosion, \ndeposition, and resuspension processes. Implications of various management practices on the bay \nwere also explored. The report concluded that attributing loads to individual sources is difficult \nand uncertain even in the most highly studied watersheds. The importance of this is summarized \nin a quote from the executive summary: \n \n“... one of the most important conclusions drawn by the SWGP was that the relative \ncontribution of upland sediment and the sediment stored in stream corridors has not been \nquantified in the bay watershed. Such information is important to formulate effective \nsediment-reduction strategies.” \n \nHowever, a few specific examples were cited where this determination was made. Two \nstudies conducted in Baltimore County, Maryland, found that approximately two thirds of the \nloads were the result of channel erosion and one third of the load was due to watershed sediment \ncontribution. \nMost of the sediment yield from the watershed to the bay is transported during bankfull \nconditions, which take place on average every 1 to 2 years, and during relatively large storm \nevents. The report also discusses “legacy sediments” that were washed into streams during initial \nland clearing following colonial settlement. Unknown amounts of sediments from initial land \ndevelopment are now stored in hill slopes, riparian areas, stream beds, and floodplains. \nEventually these sediments will be washed downstream, but this process may take decades or \neven hundreds of years. \n\nAppendix Q  \nLiterature Review: Sediment Budgets and Source Studies October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nQ-6 \n3.0 COMPONENTS OF SEDIMENT BUDGET \n \nSediment budgets can be developed with a mass balance approach to account for \nsediment sources, sinks and yield (output) of sediment. Yield is discussed as a sediment delivery \nratio (the ratio of sources to output). It can vary from 0 to greater than 1 (greater than 1 indicates \nthe washing out of previously stored sediment). \nComponents of a sediment budget include: \n \n• Sources – surface, gulley and mass erosion + channel erosion; and \n• Sinks – hillslope storage, floodplain storage, and channel storage. \n \nBudgets are usually calculated on an annual yield, and do not predict large amounts of \nsediment movement during short time periods (high-flow events). Budgets can be used to guide \nmanagement practices and estimate the influence of local landscape changes on the sediment \nyield. \n \n\nAppendix Q  \nLiterature Review: Sediment Budgets and Source Studies October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nQ-7 \n4.0 SEDIMENT REFERENCE YIELDS AND TMDL TARGETS \n \nEffective discharge is defined as the water discharge or range of discharges that shape \nchannels and perform the most geomorphic work (erosion and transport of sediment) over the \nlong term. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) uses “target yields,” \nwhich represent a range of sediment yields at the Q\n1.5\n flow for stable and unstable streams for \nsediment total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). Yields differ for each Level III Ecoregion. The \ntarget yields are based on the work of NSL (Simon et al 2002a). \nNSL calculated the effective discharge for ten sites in Mississippi where a sufficient \nrecord of flow and suspended sediment concentrations were available (all sites included at least \n10 years of record). The average ratio of Q\n1.5\n to effective discharge was 1.2, showing that the \nQ\n1.5\n can be used as a surrogate for effective discharge. NSL used this assumption to calculate \nsuspended sediment yields at the Q\n1.5\n flow for all sites with available data. Ranges of the Q\n1.5\n \nyields (25\nth\n and 75\nth\n percentile) became the TMDL targets for stable and unstable streams. \nMDEQ has developed sediment TMDLs using ranges of expected sediment yields for \nstable versus unstable streams. The TMDL targets are based on expected yields at the effective \ndischarge. This discharge can be estimated as the Q\n1.5\n. \nThe effective yields were developed by NSL based on analysis of suspended sediment \nand flow data for streams in each ecoregion. Streams with an adequate record of monitoring data \nwere grouped as stable and unstable based on a geomorphic assessment (Simon et al. 2002a). \nThe majority of the Reservoir watershed is located in Ecoregion 65, the Southeastern Plains. The \nexception to this is a portion of the Pelahatchie Bay watershed, which is in Ecoregion 74, the \nLoess Plains. Soils in the Loess Plains are among the most erosive soils in the Unites States. For \nthis reason, the TMDL targets are an order of magnitude higher for streams in the Loess Plains. \nMDEQ used the 25\nth\n and 75\nth\n percentile of the yields calculated for each ecoregion as the low \nand high targets for sediment TMDLs (Table Q.1). \n \n\nAppendix Q  \nLiterature Review: Sediment Budgets and Source Studies October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nQ-8 \nTable Q.1.

There is no specific rule as to how much data is \nadequate, but 5 years is a typical rule of thumb. Using this rule, there are three stations in the \nReservoir watershed with adequate data. These stations are Mill Creek at Highway 25, and \nunnamed tributary to Mill Creek, and Fannegusha Creek near Sand Hill. The Q\n1.5\n sediment yields \nwere estimated for these stations (Table Q.2). \n \nTable Q.2.

Biedenharn, PhD, of the Biedenharn Group, LLC, and was submitted \non September 20, 2011. Current contact information is phone number (601) 529-4685 and email \nbidenharngroup@yahoo.com\n.  \n \nThis scope of work describes the tasks involved in the development of a broad-scale \ngeomorphic assessment and sediment budget for the Pearl River Watershed upstream of the Ross \nBarnett Reservoir, and provides an estimate of costs to develop the assessment. Developing a \nsediment budget for a large system such as the Pearl River Watershed is complex, and there will \nbe considerable uncertainty in the results, no matter what level of study is conducted. Because of \nthis, it is often advisable, particularly in reconnaissance and feasibility level studies to conduct a \nmore general assessment of representative segments of the watershed and then extrapolate these \nresults to the remaining watershed. Development of a broad-scale sediment budget to estimate \nthe amount of sediment delivered to the Ross Barnett Reservoir from the contributing basin \nincludes identification of potential sediment sources and sinks, quantification of these data by \ngrain size, and consideration of the uncertainty of the data. The sediment budget estimates the \nvolumes and transport rates of sediments in the contributing watershed and provides a scientific \nframework for identifying, screening and evaluating potential alternatives for the purpose of \nreducing sediment yield and improving water quality. The broad-scale assessment also serves as \nthe foundation for more detailed geomorphic analyses and sediment modeling if these efforts are \ndeemed necessary. \n \n1. Aerial Reconnaissance (with Red Hen). A helicopter reconnaissance of the \nPearl River Watershed upstream of the Ross Barnett Reservoir will be conducted \nto provide a broad perspective of the watershed processes. A geo-referenced video \nwill also be collected from the helicopter using the Red Hen methodology. \nApproximately 1,130 miles of channels will be reconnoitered as part of this aerial \ninvestigation. \nCost Estimate: $97,410 \n \n\nAppendix R  \nPreliminary Scope of Work and Cost of Sediment Budget January 6, 2011 \n \n \n \nR-2 \n2. Analyze All Red Hen Videos. The Red Hen videos will be analyzed to document \nthe status of existing channels and structures, location of problem areas, \nidentification of type and extent of bed and bank erosion, sediment sources and \nsink areas, and significant morphological features. \nCost Estimate: $19,680 \n \n3. Field (Ground) Investigations. Using the results of the Red Hen analysis, a \nground investigation of the watersheds will be conducted. These ground \ninvestigations will be used to supplement the information gained through the \naerial reconnaissance. During these ground investigations, sediment samples will \nbe collected from representative sediment sources (streambanks, gullies, stream \nbeds, etc.) throughout the watersheds. All samples will be analyzed to develop \ngradations of the sediment sources. \nCost Estimate: $19,220 \n \n4. Analysis of Gage Records. An analysis of all available stage and discharge data \nin the watershed will be conducted. Stage trends will be analyzed to assess \ndegradational and aggradational trends. An analysis of the available measured \nsuspended sediment data will also be conducted. Total annual sediment loads will \nbe developed for the period of records available at each gage. If data are available, \nthe annual loads will be developed by grain size. An analysis will be conducted to \nassess spatial and temporal trends in the data. \nCost Estimate: $7,380 \n \n5. Estimates of Sediment Supply from Sources. The major sediment sources in the \nreconnoitered streams will be identified. Typical sources may include sediment \nsupply from stream bank erosion, upland erosion from the watershed, gullies, and \nthe channel bed. Quantitative estimates of the annual supply of sediment, by grain \nsize, will be developed for these sediment sources. Estimates will also be made of \nthe un-surveyed portions of the watersheds since these 1\nst\n and 2\nnd\n order streams \nmay represent a significant source of sediment in these watersheds.  \nEach sediment source will be analyzed with as much accuracy as possible, given \nlimitations of available data sources and methods by which input was developed. \nHowever, it must be recognized that there will still be considerable uncertainty in \nthe development of all these estimates. A value of variability (e.g., +/-25%, \n+/- 10%, etc.) will be assigned to each individual source estimate and an \nuncertainty anal\n\nysis will be conducted to present a range of values for these \ninputs. \nCost Estimate: $24,360 \n \n\nAppendix R  \nPreliminary Scope of Work and Cost of Sediment Budget January 6, 2011 \n \n \n \nR-3 \n6. Develop Sediment Budget. A spreadsheet-based sediment budget will be \ndeveloped by integrating the knowledge gained through the tasks above. The \nsediment budget will identify the major sources and sinks in the system, and how \nthese source sediments are related to the sinks. A range of results will be \ndeveloped reflecting the uncertainty analyses. \nCost Estimate: $17,880 \n \n7. Report. A report summarizing the findings of the study will be prepared and \nsubmitted to the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality. \nCost Estimate: $7,380 \n \n \nTotal Cost for All Tasks – $198,310 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPENDIX S \n \nPERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR \nGREEN INFRASTRUCTURE \n \n\nAppendix S  \nPerformance Measures for Green Infrastructure October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nS-1 \nThe following appendix contains recommended design criteria for specific stormwater \nbest management practices. The design criteria were developed by the Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality (MDEQ) in order to assist developers in designing stormwater \nmanagement structures that improve water quality. The recommendations are consistent with \ngreen infrastructure enhancement in the Ross Barnett Reservoir watershed. The design criteria \nare reprinted below and will be included in MDEQ’s Planning and Design Manual for the \nControl of Erosion, Sediment, and Stormwater. \n \nAdditional Recommended Design Criteria, Specifications and Methodologies\n \n \n \nThe following criteria, specifications, and methodologies are recommended for stormwater \nmanagement systems that are not specified by applicable regulatory requirements of federal, \nstate or local jurisdictions. \n \nWet Detention Systems:  These systems collect and temporarily store stormwater in a \npermanently wet impoundment in such a manner as to provide for treatment through physical, \nchemical, and biological processes with subsequent gradual release of the stormwater.  These \nsystems should be designed to meet the following requirements: \n \n1. Required volume: First 0.5 inch of runoff or 1.5 inches of runoff from impervious area \n \n2. Return time: Outfall structure must discharge one half (½) volume of stormwater within 48 to \n72 hours.  No more than one half (½) the volume will be discharged within 48 hours. \n \n3. Permanent pool: Provide average residence time at least 14 days during wet season  \n \n4. Littoral zone design: \n \n1. Sloped (4:1 or flatter) to a depth of at least 2 feet below control elevation; \napproximately 30 percent of the wet detention system surface area should be \nlittoral zone (ratio of vegetated littoral zone to surface area of the pond at the \ncontrol elevation). \n2. The treatment volume should not cause pond level to rise more than 18 inches \nabove the control elevation, unless the littoral zone vegetation can survive at \ngreater depths. \n3. Eighty percent coverage of the littoral zone vegetation should be established \nwithin the first 24 months.  Portions of the littoral zone may be established by \nplacement of wetland topsoils (at least a four inch depth) containing a seed source \nof desirable native plants.  To utilize this alternative, the littoral zone must be \nstabilized by mulching or other means. \n\nAppendix S  \nPerformance Measures for Green Infrastructure October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nS-2 \n4. A forebay should be established at the pond inflow points to capture larger sediment \nparticles and be 4 to 6 feet deep.  The forebay volume should equal about 20% of the total \nbasin volume.  Multiple inlets may require additional volume.  Direct maintenance access \nshould be a minimum of 15 feet wide, with a maximum slope of 5:1. \n \n5. Mean depth of the permanent pool should be between 2 and 8 feet.  The maximum depth \nshould not exceed 12 feet below the invert of the outlet device, unless the deeper depths \nwill not inhibit physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes or cause re-\nsuspension of pollutants into the water column due to anaerobic conditions in the water \ncolumn. \n \n6. Flow path through pond should have an average length to width ratio of at least 2:1.  The \nalignment and location of inlets and outlets should maximize flow paths in the pond.  If \nshort flow paths are unavoidable, the effective flow path should be increased by adding \ndiversion barriers such as islands, peninsulas, or baffles to the pond.  Inlet structures should \nbe designed to dissipate the energy of water entering the pond.   \n \n7. Outlet devices incorporating dimensions smaller than three inches minimum width or less \nthan 20 degrees for “v” notches should include a device to eliminate clogging.  Examples \ninclude baffles, grates, and pipe elbows. \n \n8. Outlet structure invert elevations should be at or above the estimated post-development \nnormal ground water table elevation.  If the proposed structure is set below this elevation, \nground water inflow must be considered in the drawdown calculations, calculation of \naverage residence time, estimated normal water level in the pond, and pollution removal \nefficiency of the system. \n \n9. Permanent maintenance easements or other acceptable legal instruments to allow for access \nto and maintenance of the system, including the pond, littoral zone, inlets, and outlet should \nbe established. \n \nDry Retention Systems:\n These systems are designed to collect and temporarily store stormwater \nin a normally dry basin with subsequent gradual release of the stormwater.  Dry detention is \nrecommended as an off-line system, but if the design calls for an in-line system, additional \nvolume may be required.  Additional volume may be required for on-line systems. These systems \nshould be incorporated as a best management practice in a treatment train approach, which \nincludes other best management practices, including but not limited to, grassed swales, level \nspreaders, filter strips, buffer zones, bioretention, and skip curbs all with water flow lengths less \nthan 300 feet.  Dry retention systems are not recommended for use in areas that require piped \nwater conveyance systems.  These systems should be designed to meet the following \nrequirements: \n \n1. Required volume: first 1.0 inch of runoff or 2.5 inches from impervious areas, whichever is \ngreater? \n\nAppendix S  \nPerformance Measures for Green Infrastructure October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nS-3 \n2. Return Time: Discharge one-half the appropriate treatment volume of stormwater specified \nabove between 24-30 hours following a storm event. \n \n3. Discharge structures should include a device to prevent the discharge of accumulated \nsediment, minimize exit velocities, and prevent clogging.  A perforated riser enclosed in a \ngravel jacket and perforated pipes enclosed in sand or gravel is a good example. \n \n4. Contain areas of standing water for no more than 3 days following a storm event. \n \n5. Stabilized with permanent native vegetative cover. \n \n6. Average flow path through the basin should have a length to width ratio of at least 3:1.  The \nalignment and location of inlets and outlets should be designed to maximize flow paths in \nthe basin.  If short flow paths are unavoidable, the effective flow path should be increased \nby adding diversion barriers such as baffles. \n \n7. Inlet structures should be designed to dissipate the energy of water entering the basin. \n \n8. A maintenance schedule is recommended for removal of sediment and debris on at least a \nbi-monthly basis, as well as mowing and removal of grass clippings. \n \n9. Basin floor should be level or uniformly sloped (1-2% maximum) toward the outfall \nstructure. \n \n10. Basin floor should be at least three feet above the seasonal high ground water table \nelevation.  Sumps may be placed up to one foot below the control elevation. \n \n11. Permanent maintenance easements or other acceptable legal instruments should be in place \nto allow for access to and maintenance of the system.  The easement or other acceptable \ninstrument should cover the entire stormwater system. \n \nConstructed Wetland Systems:\n  Wetland systems collect and temporarily store stormwater in a \npermanently wet impoundment and provides treatment through physical, chemical, and \nbiological processes.  These systems should be designed to meet the following requirements. \n \n1. Required volume: First 1.0 inch of runoff or 2.5 inches of runoff from impervious area. \n \n2. Inflow of water must be greater than infiltration. \n \n3. Designed for an extended detention time of 24 hours for the 1-year storm event. \n \n4. Protection against blockage should be installed around outlets vulnerable to blockage form \nplant material or other debris that will enter the basin with stormwater runoff.  Reverse \nslope pipes are recommended. \n\nAppendix S  \nPerformance Measures for Green Infrastructure October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nS-4 \n5. Surface area of the wetland should account for a minimum 3% of the area of the watershed \ndraining into it. \n \n6. The length to width ratio should be at least 3 to 1. \n \n7. Deeper area of the wetland should include the outlet structure so that the outflow from the \nbasin is not impeded by sediment buildup. \n \n8. A forebay should be established at the pond inflow points to capture larger sediment \nparticles and be 4 to 6 feet deep.  The forebay volume should equal about 20% of the total \nbasin volume.  Multiple inlets may require additional forebay volume.  Direct maintenance \naccess should be a minimum of 15 feet wide, with a maximum slope of 5:1. \n \n9. In cases where water velocities exceed 0.5 ft/s, energy dissipation devices should be \ninstalled. \n \n10. Pre- and post-grading pondscaping design should be used to create both horizontal and \nvertical diversity and habitat. \n \n11. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of the shoulder (12 inches or less) area of the basin should \nbe planted with native wetland vegetation.   \n \n12. A 25-foot buffer, for all but pocket wetlands, should be established and planted with native \nriparian and upland vegetation. \n \n13. Surrounding slopes should be stabilized by planting in order to minimize sediment and \npollutants from entering the wetland. \n \n14. A written maintenance plan should be provided and adequate provision made for on going \ninspection and maintenance.  Maintenance should be scheduled more often during the first \nthree years after construction. \n \n15. Permanent maintenance easements or other acceptable legal instruments to allow for access \nto and maintenance of the system is recommended.  The easement or other acceptable \ninstrument should cover the entire stormwater system. \n \nSwale Systems:\n These systems are man-made trenches which filter and treat stormwater runoff \nas part of a treatment train approach.  Swale system criteria may vary depending on its place in \nthe treatment train.  However, at a minimum these systems should be designed to meet the \nfollowing requirements: \n \n1. Required volume should be designed for a 6-month, 24-hour design storm event. \n \n2. No contiguous areas of standing or flowing water within 72 hours following storm event. \n\nAppendix S  \nPerformance Measures for Green Infrastructure October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nS-5 \n3. Peak discharges should be 5 to 10 cfs. \n \n4. Water velocity should be 1.0 to 1.5 ft/s. \n \n5. Maximum design flow depth should be 1 foot. \n \n6. Swale slopes: \na. Graded as close to zero as possible and still permit drainage \nb. Should not exceed 2% \n \n7. Must have a top width to depth ratio of greater than 6:1, or cross-section side slopes of 3:1 \n(horizontal:vertical) or flatter. \n \n8. Swale length should be at least 100 feet per acre of drainage area. \n \n9. Underlying soils should have high permeability. \n \n10. Swales must be planted with or have stabilized native vegetation suitable for soil \nstabilization, stormwater treatment, and nutrient uptake. \n \n11. Soil erodibility, soil percolation, slope, slope length, and drainage area must be taken into \naccount, in order to prevent erosion and reduce pollutant concentration of any discharge. \n \n12. Permanent maintenance easements or other acceptable legal instruments to allow for access \nto and maintenance of the system is recommended.  The easement or other acceptable \ninstrument must cover the entire stormwater system. \n \nManufactured Stormwater Treatment Systems:\n These systems are recommended for use in \ncommercial and industrial developments.  The manufactured systems should satisfy the \nfollowing conditions: \n \n1. Field test data from the southeastern United States should be available.  The test data \nshould be from an area with similar rainfall distribution as the project area.   \n \n2. Field test data should provide the following results: \na. Removal of 70-80% of total suspended solids (TSS) \nb. Particle size distribution for TSS removal rates \nc. Conditions under which TSS removal is obtained (storm event, rainfall intensity, \netc.) \n \n3. Maintenance information should include how often the system should be serviced. \n \n4. Manufactured systems should be structurally sound and designed for acceptable \nmunicipal and commercial traffic loadings. \n\nAppendix S  \nPerformance Measures for Green Infrastructure October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nS-6 \n5. Manufactured systems should not allow inflow or infiltration. \n \n6. Weirs, openings, and pipes should be sized to pass, as a minimum, the storm drain system \ndesign storm. \n \n7. Manholes should be provided to each chamber to provide access for cleaning. \n \n8. Treatment train approach incorporating the use of other appropriate best management \npractices is recommended because efficiency will be increased and maintenance reduced. \n \n9. Permanent maintenance easements or other acceptable legal instruments to allow for \naccess to and maintenance of the system is recommended.   \n \nDetention Practice Criteria:\n  These criteria are recommended when post-construction runoff \nvolumes should be kept to pre-construction values in order to prevent downstream degradation \nand flooding.  Detention basins and associated outflow structures should be designed to address \nthe 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 25-year, and 50-year, 24-hour storm events.  \n \n Runoff volumes and rates may be calculated using the SCS Runoff Curve \n Number Method (see Appendix Volume, Appendix A, A-16).  \n \n Detention storage may be determined using the Short Cut Floodrouting Method\n for determining drainage areas and runoffs that fall with the method’s limits.  If \n drainage areas and runoffs fall outside the method’s limits other detention sizing  \n methodologies should be used. \n \nErosion and Sediment Control Calculations for Estimated Reductions:\n  The effect of BMPs \nmay be calculated using the USLE methodology (see Appendix Volume, Appendix A, A-2).  \nDuring construction, the BMP plan should demonstrate the ability to keep sediment yield to 115% \nof the pre-disturbance sediment yield (15% increase in sediment above pre-disturbance \nconditions).  This is knows as performance based planning.  A performance based plan can \ndemonstrate that selected practices may meet the desired results. \n \nEffectiveness of Erosion and Sediment Control BMPs\n:  An estimate of the effectiveness of a \nselection of the more common erosion and sediment control BMPs may be found on Page A-11 of \nthe Appendix Volume).  These estimates can help in performance based planning. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPENDIX T \n \nCOST ESTIMATES FOR \nMANAGEMENT MEASURES \n\nAppendix T  \nCost Estimates for Management Measures October 31, 2011 \n \n \n \nT-1 \nINTRODUCTION\t\n \nCost estimates for installing management measures in the watersheds targeted for \nrestoration were developed based on the areas proposed for new development and retrofits. Costs \non a per-area or per-practice basis are based on estimated costs from various sources. Table T.1 \nalso includes the relative land consumption that was used to estimate the footprint of the \nmanagement practice based on the land area treated by the practice. For example, a correctly \nsized bioretention basin designed to treat the first-flush of stormwater will require approximately \n5% of the land area draining into it. Tables T.2 through T.4 include cost estimates for \nmanagement measures recommended for targeted watersheds. Cost estimates were converted to \n2010 values based on an annualized inflation rate of 2.39%.\n1\n \n \n                                                \n \n1\n Per Measuring Worth website. Online at http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/. Average Annualized \ninflation rate from 1997 to 2010 is 2.39% based on the consumer price index. \n\nAppendix T \n \nCost Estimates for Management Measures \nOctober 31, 2011 \n \n  \nT-2 \nTable T.1.
