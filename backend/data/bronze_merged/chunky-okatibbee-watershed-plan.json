General  threats  across  the  watershed  \ninclude  sedimentation  from  urbanization,  agriculture,  silvaculture,  and  mining  \nactivities.  More specific pollutants of concern are non-point sources of pollution \nsuch  as  polluted  runoff  from  impervious  areas,  sediment  and  silt,  pathogens  \nassociated   with   leaking   septic   systems   in   unsewered   areas,   pathogens   \nassociated with animal waste, fertilizers, pesticides, and mercury.  \n \nThe  Chunky-Okatibbee  Watershed  Implementation  Plan  is  intended  to  provide  \nthe  formulation  of  strategies  designed  to  protect  water  quality,  enhance  and  \nprotect the natural resources of the watershed, and to allow the watershed as a \nwhole  to  realize  its  potential  for  its  intended  uses  through  the  application  of  \neducation    measures,    sound    scientific    principles    and    natural    resources    \nmanagement   practices.      The   provisions   and   strategies   of   this   plan   were   \nconceived  through  a  collaborative  process  that  reflected  a  variety  of  interests  \nidentified  from  stakeholders  located  both  within  the  watershed  and  throughout  \nthe  State  of  Mississippi.    The  strategies  incorporated  into  the  plan  fit  within  two  \nprimary categories that include Watershed Management Activities (technical) and \nEducation Outreach Activities.   \n \nMany   of   the   proposed   activities   will   be   conducted   throughout   the   entire   \nwatershed; however, some of the proposed activities will target only the Chunky \nRiver   and   associated   streams   because   the   Chunky   River   and   associated   \nstreams  have  been  identified  as  the  primary  priority  areas  within  the  watershed  \nvia   the   process   of   meeting,   soliciting   feedback,   and   planning.      The   \nimplementation  of  this  plan  will  primarily  be  carried  out  by  the  Watershed  \nImplementation  Team  (WIT)  that  is  led  and  directed  by  the  East  Mississippi  \nFoothills   Land   Trust   (Land   Trust).      The   Land   Trust   assumes   primary   \nresponsibility  for  the  contractual  obligations  with  the  Mississippi  Department  of  \nEnvironmental Quality (MDEQ) and will direct implementation, evaluation, review \nand revision activities.   \n \nWhile  the  primary  focus  of  the  WIT  is  to  promote  a  variety  of  structural  and  \nnonstructural best management practices that address technical and educational \naspects of water quality management in the watershed, the primary focus of the \nLand   Trust   is   to   encourage   conservation   easements,   buffer   zones   and   \nstreamside   management.

Chunky-Okatibbee  Watershed  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  overall  water  quality  \nnot only in the Pascagoula River Basin itself, but also in that of the Gulf of Mexico \nbecause this watershed comprises the northern-most reaches of the Pascagoula \nRiver  Basin.  As  part  of  the  second  largest  drainage  basin  in  Mississippi,  the  \nChunky-Okatibbee  Watershed  is  critical  to  the  overall  health  of  the  basin  \nbecause   activities   taking   place   in   the   watershed,   whether   beneficial   or   \ndetrimental,  will  have  an  impact  on  water  quality  throughout  the  basin  and  the  \nGulf of Mexico. \n \nBecause  of  the  unique  characteristics  of  both  the  Pascagoula  River  Basin  and  \nthe Chunky-Okatibbee Watershed, it has been determined that the development \nand  implementation  of  a  watershed  implementation  program  would  address  \nwater  quality  issues  and  concerns  not  only  within  the  watershed  but  throughout  \nthe  basin.    The  watershed  management  program  includes  the  formation  of  a  \nWatershed   Implementation   Team   (WIT)   and   subsequent   development   and   \nimplementation of a Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP).   \n \nThe pages to follow in this document are the result of an intensive planning effort \nundertaken  by  a  very  large  and  diverse  group  of  local,  state,  and  federal  \nstakeholders.  The plan references numerous organizations, agencies and other \nstakeholders  that  played  a  critical  role  in  the  development  of  the  plan  and  its  \nstrategies.  Many of these are referenced by acronym.  While efforts have been \nmade to reduce the number and frequency of acronym usage, a table has been \nprovided as Appendix A that provides a guide to acronyms and their meanings. \n \nThe process of developing this document has included multiple stages, many of \nwhich have been conducted concurrently.  These components include planning, \npublic  education,  development  of  strategies  for  watershed  and  water  quality  \nprotection, development of strategies for \nwater       quality       restoration,       and       \ndevelopment   of   a   plan   for   on-going   \nmonitoring.    Each  component  of  this  \nplan  will  play  an  integral  role  in  the  \nsuccess  of  the  established  goals  and  \nobjectives  of  the  plan.    This  plan  is  the  \nsum  of  all  of  its  parts  and  should  be  \nviewed,  analyzed  and  implemented  in  a  \ncomprehensive  manner  in  order  for  the  \nimplementation    process    to    be    fully    \nsuccessful. \nDunn’s Falls\n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              7                                                                              \n \n2.1      V\nISION STATEMENT \n \nThe   vision   of   the   Chunky-Okatibbee   WIT   is   to   establish   a   watershed   \nmanagement  framework  designed  to  protect  water  quality,  enhance  and  protect  \nthe  natural  resources  that  exist  within  the  watershed,  and  to  allow  the  entire  \nwatershed,  as  a  natural  system,  to  fully  realize  its  potential  for  the  designated  \nwater  uses  through  the  application  of  education  measures,  sound  scientific  \nprinciples, and natural resource management practices. \n2.2      M\nISSION STATEMENT \n \nThe  mission  of  this  effort  is  to  develop  a  Watershed  Implementation  Plan  (WIP)  \nemphasizing  practices  to  assist  in  the  realization  of  the  Land  Trust’s  mission  to  \n“conserve, promote, and protect the open spaces and green places of ecological, \ncultural or scenic significance in East Mississippi.”  This WIP is being prepared to \naddress  suspected  and  documented  water  quality  impairments  within  the  target  \nwatershed, as well as to address concerns identified by the WIT.  The goal of the \nWIP  is  to  improve  water  quality  of  impaired  waters,  protect  water  quality  in  \nunimpaired waters, and promote conservation management of natural resources \nwithin the target watershed. The WIP addresses water quality impairment due to \nerosion,  sediment,  siltation,  litter,  organic  debris,  excess  nutrients,  suspended  \nsolids,  and  pathogens.    Through  the  development  and  implementation  of  this  \nplan,  the  WIT  will  promote  structural  as  well  as  non-structural  practices  to  \naddress  issues  of  concern  and  priority  areas.      The  goals  of  the  plan  will  be  \nachieved  through  a  combination  of  assessment,  education,  public  involvement,  \ntargeted  management  actions,  and  land  conservation  easements.    Assessment  \nof  water  quality  at  key  locations  in  the  watershed  will  be  included  as  the  initial  \nsteps in identifying causes of impairment.   \n2.3      W\nATERSHED IMPLEMENTATION TEAM \n \nThe following entities are represented on the Chunky-Okatibbee Watershed \nImplementation Team: \n \nAudubon Society \nCity of Meridian \nClarkco State Park \nClarke County Board of Supervisors \nCommunity Foundation of East Mississippi \nEast Central Mississippi Planning and Development District \nEast Mississippi Business Development Corporation \nEast Mississippi Community College – Phi Theta Kappa \nEast Mississippi Foothills Land Trust \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              8                                                                              \nEco-Systems, Inc.

In    fact,    the    \nChunky-Okatibbee \nWatershed    forms    the    \nheadwaters       of       the       \nPascagoula  River  Basin.    \nThis       watershed       is       \napproximately            912            \nsquare       miles       and       \n586,240      acres      and      \ncontains  important  water  bodies  such  as  the  Chunky  Creek,  Chunky  River,  \nSowashee  Creek,  Okatibbee  Creek,  Bonita  Lakes  and  Okatibbee  Lake.    Please  \nsee Appendix B for specific maps related to the Chunky-Okatibbee Watershed.  \n \nThe  Chunky  River  is  located  in  east-central  Mississippi  and  is  a  tributary  of  the  \nChickasawhay  River.    The  Chunky  River  begins  in  Newton  County  between  the  \ntowns  of  Hickory  and  Chunky  and  is  formed  by  the  confluence  of  the  Chunky  \nCreek  and  Okahatta  Creek.    The  river  flows  southeastwardly  through  the  \nsouthwest  portion  of  Lauderdale  County  and  the  northwest  portion  of  Clarke  \nCounty.    The  Chunky  River  joins  Okatibbee  Creek  near  Enterprise  to  form  the  \nChickasawhay River.  Dunn’s Falls is a wonderful attraction on the Chunky River \njust  north  of  Enterprise.      Dunn’s  Falls  consists  of  a  65-foot  waterfall  that  was  \ncreated  to  power  a  mill  in  the  mid  1800’s  and  is  now  open  to  visitors  as  a  park  \noperated by the Pat Harrison Waterway District.  \n \nThe Chunky River is rich in heritage and was named for a Choctaw Indian game \ncalled “Chanki” played with a round disc and sticks on the sandy flat banks of the \nChunky  River.  In  addition  to  its  historical  and  cultural  importance,  the  Chunky  \nRiver is also known for its abundant natural resources.   \n \nA  portion  of  the  Chunky  River  from  the  joining  of  Chunky  Creek  and  Tallasher  \nCreek  and  the  Chunky  River  in  Newton,  Lauderdale, and Clarke counties to the \njunction  with  the  Chickasawhay  River  in  Clarke  County  was  designated  as  a  \nscenic  river  by  the  Mississippi  Legislators  in  2003.    The  river  is  part  of  the  \nstatewide program for protection of the most scenic and least altered waterways \nin Mississippi.   \n \nCanoeing the Chunky\n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              12                                                                              \nOkatibbee  Lake  is  located  seven  miles  \nnorthwest  of  Meridian  on  the  Okatibbee  \nCreek.    The  lake  is  a  4,144-acre  lake  \ndesigned  primarily  for  flood  control  in  the  \n1960’s  but  also  serves  as  an  excellent  \nfishing  lake.    Largemouth  bass,  catfish,  \ncrappie,  and  bream  are  abundant  in  the  \nlake.    The  land  area  around  Okatibbee  \nLake  is  approximately  7,000  acres  and  is  \na haven for wildlife such as Bald Eagles, deer, rabbit, dove, ducks, geese, quail, \nwoodcock,  and  alligators.      The  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  operates  the  Twitley  \nBranch Campground at the Okatibbee Lake, and Pat Harrison Waterway District \noperates the campground at Okatibbee Water Park. \n \nOther  significant  water  bodies  within  the  watershed  include  Bonita  Lakes  and  \nDogwood  Lake.    The  Bonita  Lake  area  includes  a  small  chain  of  lakes  totaling  \napproximately 308 acres located in southeast Meridian.  The lakes are primarily \nused for recreation and offer fishing a boating related activities.  Dogwood Lake \nconsists of approximately 49 acres and is located north of the City of Meridian. \n \nThe  Sowashee  Creek  flows  in  a  southwesterly  direction  through  the  City  of  \nMeridian  and  then  to  the  Okatibbee  Creek.    The  development  along  the  \nSowashee  Creek  is  a  mix  of  industrial,  commercial,  and  residential  land  uses.    \nBecause   of   stream   encroachment,   non-point   source   urban   pollution,   and   \nindustrial  point  sources,  water  quality  is  considered  impaired  in  this  creek.    The  \ntables  that  follow  include  primary  waterways  and  water  bodies  that  exist  in  the  \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed. \n \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Creeks and Rivers \nName \nLength

Mississippi  including:    Clarke,  \nKemper,   Lauderdale,   Neshoba,   and   \nNewton.  The watershed also includes \nthe    following    cities,    towns,    and    \npopulated    areas:    Union,    Decatur,    \nNewton,  Hickory,  Chunky,  Collinsville,  \nMeridian,   and   Marion.      The   total   \nestimated population of the watershed \nis  84,329  according  to  the  2000  U.S.  \nCensus.      Of   the   total   watershed   \npopulation,  approximately  51,085  or  60%  live  within  the  eight  cities  and  towns  \nlisted  above.    The  largest  population  center  within  the  watershed  is  the  City  of  \nMeridian with a population of 39,968 or approximately 47% of the total watershed \npopulation.      Given   the   above-detailed   population   figures   and   estimates,   \napproximately  40-60%  of  the  total  watershed  population  lives  within  urban  or  at  \nleast   suburban   environments,   and   the   remainder   live   in   largely   rural   \nenvironments.   \nRegional Culture\n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              16                                                                              \n \nA review of the Census Bureaus population estimate data for 2006 indicates that \nthe population in the region and the watershed is growing at a constant rate with \nmost  of  the  growth  occurring  in  Lauderdale,  and  Neshoba  Counties.    Newton,  \nClarke  and  Kemper  County  have  lost  population  according  to  the  latest  census  \nestimate  data.    This  follows  an  emerging  state-wide  trend  of  migration  to  the  \nmore   urbanized   areas   of   the   state.      Population   projections   through   2011   \nindicated that Lauderdale County will continue to increase in population while the \nother  four  counties  in  the  watershed  will  continue  to  decrease  in  population.    \nDuring  a  four-year  period  from  2001-2004  all  five  counties  within  the  watershed  \nhave  shown  a  negative  net  migration  except  Neshoba  County.    Neshoba  \nCounty’s  growth  is  likely  due  to  the  increase  in  economic  opportunities  offered  \nthrough  the  gaming  and  tourism  related  industries  in  the  county.    Although  \npopulation  in  the  watershed  appears  to  be  declining,  there  is  a  general  upward  \ntrend  in  median  household  income  that  is  consistent  across  all  five  watershed  \ncounties.

There  is  also  a  statistically  significant  percentage  of  relatively  \nnew  (2000-2003)  pine  plantations.    The  amount  of  urban  lands  relative  to  other  \ntypes  of  land  cover  within  the  watershed  is  small.    The  conclusion  is  that  the  \nmajority  of  land  cover  within  the  watershed  is  dominated  by  a  variety  of  \nvegetative covers. \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              18                                                                              \n \n \n3.3      PHYSICAL GEOLOGY \n \nThe Chunky-Okatibbee Watershed is located within the North Central Hills region \nof  the  Southern  Coastal  Plain.

Wetlands  provide  a  number  of  valuable  functions  \nincluding  protection  and  improvement  of  water  quality  and  management  of  \nfloodwaters.  Wetlands also typically contain the greatest diversity of wildlife and \nplant life of any system in the landscape.   \n \nIn  this  watershed,  wetlands  exist  primarily  in  conjunction  with  streams  and  are  \noften located in the floodplains of the stream channels.  Also present are spring \nhead  wetland  areas  that  are  often  found  in  many  of  the  steep  ravines  of  the  \nwatershed.    The  dominant  wetland  type  is  composed  of  bottomland  hardwood  \nforested areas along streams and in floodplains.

In  general,  the  wetland  \nareas  within  the  watershed  are  dominated  by  canopy  species  of  oak,  hickory,  \nsweetgum,  blackgum,  willow,  and  maple  with  some  areas  of  cypress  and  water  \ntupelo present.   \n \nFew examples of wetland management activities currently exist in the watershed \nwith  the  notable  exception  of  “Streamside  Management  Zones”  (SMZs),  which  \nare  timber  harvesting  practices  encouraged  throughout  the  watershed.    Timber  \nproduction constitutes one of the major land uses in the watershed and practices \nsuch  as  clear-cutting  have  the  potential  to  result  in  significant  disturbance  of  \nsoils.    The  SMZ  practice  is  designed  to  protect  water  quality  of  streams  and  \nwetlands  by  limiting  clearing  of  areas  along  streams  and  providing  a  buffer  for  \nmanaging runoff from adjacent disturbed areas.  While it would be expected that \nan increase in urbanization would lead to impacts on either the quantity or quality \nof wetlands within the watershed; there is not enough available data to determine \nthat either a positive or negative trend exists. \n3.5      E\nNVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AREAS \n \nThe only environmental management area within the watershed is the Okatibbee \nWildlife Management Area that surrounds the Okatibbee Reservoir.  While there \nare  no  national  forests  within  the  watershed,  the  Bienville  National  Forrest  is  \ndirectly  adjacent  to  the  watershed  near  its  southwestern  border.    In  addition  to  \nthe  above-described  areas,  there  are  numerous  recreational  areas  within  the  \nwatershed  that  include  both  natural  and  manmade  assets  such  as  roadside  \nparks,   boat   launches,   community   and   neighborhood   parks   and   the   actual   \nstreams within the watershed that provide public access. \n \nLand Cover in the Watershed \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan Chunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project May 2007                                                                                                                                                             Page                                                                              20                                                                              3.6      P\nARKS AND \nR\nECREATIONAL \nA\nREAS\n     \nSite Name \nCity \nCOUNTY \nFacility Type \nAssociated Water Body \nBen Arthur Davis Park \nMeridi\nan \nLauderdale \nNeighborhood Park \n  \nBonita Lake Park \nMeridian \nLauderdale \nUn\nique Natural Park/Primitive Natura\nl Park/Recreation Area \nBonita Lake \nBriarwood Country Club \nMeridian \nLauderdale \nSi\nngle / Special Purpose Facility \n  \nCampground RV Park \nMeridian \nLauderdale \nSi\nngle / Special Purpose Facility \n  \nChickasawhay Creek \n  \nKemper \nUnique Natural Park/Primi\ntive Natural Park/Recreation Area \nChickasawhay Creek \nChinqupin Lake \n  \nLauderdal\ne        Other        \nChinqupin        Lake        \nChunky Community Ballfield \nChunky \nNewton \nCommunity Playfield \n  \nChunky River \n  \nClarke \nUnique Natural Park/Primi\ntive Natural Park/Recreation Area \nChunky River \nChunky River \n  \nLauderdale \nUnique Natural Park/Primiti\nve Natural Park/Recreation Area \nChunky River \nChunky River \n  \nNewton \nUnique Natural Park/Primiti\nve Natural Park/Recreation Area \nChunky River \nChunky River Boat Ramp \n  \nLauderdale \nSingle \n/ Special Purpose Facility \nChunky River \nClark Memorial College \nNewton \nNewton \nCommunity Playfield \n  \nClarksdale Attendance Center \n  \nLauderdale \nCommunity Playfield \n  \nCollinsville Recreation Area \nCollinsville \nLauderdal\ne \nDestination Park / Recreation Area\n / National Park \nOkatibbee Reservoir \nCrestwood Ball Park \nMeridian \nLauder\ndale \nCommunity Playfield \n  \nCrestwood Elementary School \nMeridian \nLauderdale \nCommunity Playfield \n  \nDamsite (East Bank) Recreation Area \nCollinsville \nLauderdale \nDestinat\nion Park / Recreation Area / National Park \nOkatibbee Reserv\noir \nDamsite (West Bank) Recreation Area \nCollinsv\nille \nLauderdale \nDestination Park / Recreati\non Area / National Park \nOkatibbee Reserv\noir \nDecatur Town Park \nDecatur \nNewton \nCommunity Playfield \n  \nDogwood Lake \n  \nLauderdale \nOther \n  \nDunn's Falls \n  \nLauderdale \nHistoric Park / Cu\nltural Park / Facility \nDunn's Waterfall \nEarl Laird Park \nUnion \nNewton \nMajor Community Park \n  \nEast Central Community College \nDecatur \nNewton \nCommunity Playfield \n  \nEsco Park \nNewton \nNewton \nCommunity Playfield \n  \nFrank W.

The  water  quality  concerns  in  the  Chunky-\nOkatibbee  Watershed  appear  to  be  primarily  focused  on  non-point  source  \npollution  issues.    Specific  non-point  sources  of  pollution  of  concern  were  \nidentified  as  siltation/erosion,  pathogens,  agricultural  runoff,  litter/trash/debris,  \nand  forestry-related  pollution.        The  priority area identified as the primary focus \narea  in  this  watershed  was  identified  as  the  Chunky  River,  specifically,  the  26  \nmiles of scenic stream.  Other priority areas were identified as, but not limited to, \nOkatibbee  Creek,  Okatibbee  Lake,  Sowashee  Creek,  Dunn’s  Falls,  Potterchitto  \nCreek, and Tallahatta Creek.   \n \nAreas  of  concern  regarding  siltation  and  erosion  were  identified  as  the  Chunky  \nRiver  and  Dunn’s  Falls.    An  area  of  concern  regarding  pollution  from  point  \nsources,  litter,  and  flooding  was  the  Sowashee  Creek.      Areas  of  concern  \nregarding  illegal  dumping  and  littering  were  identified  as  access  points  and  \nbridges.      Also,   areas   of   concern   regarding   pathogens   were   identified   as   \nunsewered  areas  throughout  the  watershed  and  specifically  in  Okatibbee  area.    \nNatural areas of concern were major tributaries, recreational areas, and forestry \nmanagement areas.   \n \nThe   stakeholders   in   the   Chunky-Okatibbee   watershed   are   interested   in   \npreserving the cultural and natural resources in this watershed.  Fishing, hunting \nand  other  recreational  uses  associated  with  the  Chunky-Okatibbee  Watershed  \nare  not  only  a  way  of  life  for  East  Mississippi;  they  help  define  our  region.    \nAddressing  water  quality  impairment  in  this  watershed  is  a  priority  among  the  \nstakeholders  and  it  is  imperative  to  preservation  of  our  cultural  and  natural  \nresources. \n \nThe following graphs represent the results of 56 surveys received and reviewed: \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan Chunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project May 2007                                                                                                                                                             Page                                                                              24                                                                              4.1      S\nURVEY \nR\nESULTS\n \n Water Quality Concerns\n \nNon-Point Source Pollution Issues of Concern\n \n82%\n16%\n1%\n1%\nNon-Point SourcesPoint SourcesInvasive SpeciesLoss of Natural Flow Regime\n29%\n9%\n48%\n6%\n1%\n7%\nPathogensAg/Chicken RunoffSiltation/ErosionForest-Related PollutionThermal PollutionLitter/Trash\n\nWatershed Implementation Plan Chunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project May 2007                                                                                                                                                             Page                                                                              25                                                                              Point           Source           Pollution           Issues           of           Concern                                                                             Priority           Areas           \n20%\n80%\nIndustrial SourcesLagoons/Treatment Plants\n50%\n11%\n14%\n25%\nChunky\nSowashee\nOkatibbee\nOther\n\nWatershed Implementation Plan Chunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project May 2007                                                                                                                                                             Page                                                                              26                                                                              Priority Areas Classified as Other\n      \nNatural Areas Identified as Priority Areas\n23%\n22%\n11%\n11%\n11%\n11%\n11%\nDunn's FallsAccess Pts.

The  ranking  system  is  referred  to  as  the  \nMississippi   Watershed   Characterization   and   Ranking   Tool   and   is   currently   \nconsidered  provisional  data.    The  system  was  created  as  a  way  of  identifying  \nwatersheds of interest and for ranking watersheds for protection and restoration \nactivities.    The  ranking  data  is  broken  down  into  three  primary  categories  which  \ninclude: Environmental Resource Values, Human Welfare Resource Values and \nPotential Stressors.   \n \nAn  analysis  of  the  data  for  the  Chunky-Okatibbee  Watershed  indicates  high  \nenvironmental  and  human  welfare  resource  values  assigned  to  sub-watersheds  \nwithin  the  Chunky-Okatibbee  Watershed.    Potential  stressors  also  appear  to  be  \nassigned   to   sub-watersheds   within   this   watershed.      Additional   information   \nspecific  to  the  resource  value  rankings  for  specific  sub-watersheds  may  be  \nobtained  by  contacting  MDEQ.

Those  \nearliest  activities  included  such  modifications  as  impounding  small  streams  for  \npowering  water-driven  mills,  just  as  the  example  at  Dunn’s  Falls  Park,  and  also  \nsuch practices as ditching and draining of fields, and unmanaged forest clearing.    \n \nMore  recent  activities  have  included  such  modifications  as  channelization  of  \nstreams,   construction   of   impoundments   for   recreation,   and   construction   of   \nchannel  modifications  for  flood  control.    In  many  places  the  water  resources  \nremain in a relatively natural condition and the opportunities for eco-tourism and \nother   forms   of   recreation   make   the   watershed   attractive   for   conservation   \nactivities.  Through efforts led by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries \nand Parks (MDWFP) in 2003, local and state involvement resulted in designation \nby  the  Mississippi  State  Legislature  of  approximately  30  miles  of  the  Chunky  \nRiver as part of the Mississippi Scenic Streams Program.   \n \nDespite  the  fact  that  a  portion  of  the  Chunky  River  is  designated  as  a  “Scenic  \nStream,”  state  monitoring  data  indicate  that  several  of  the  streams  in  our  \nwatershed  do  not  meet  the  minimum  water  quality  measures  and  are  listed  as  \nimpaired.  Appendix D identifies impaired waterbodies in the Chunky-Okatibbee \nWatershed.   \n \nA  number  of  Total  Daily  Maximum  Loads  (TMDL)  addressing  a  variety  of  water  \nquality concerns have been developed by MDEQ for particular stream segments \nin  the  watershed  and  are  provided  in  Appendix  E  or  the  MDEQ  website  at  \nhttp://www.deq.state.ms.us\n.      Conservation   management   and   water   quality   \nmanagement  activities  within  this  watershed  have  primarily  been  sponsored  by  \nfederal   and   state   agencies   and   include   programs   for   conservation   and   \nmanagement  of  forestry  and  agriculture  such  as  those  administered  by  the  \nMississippi  Forestry  Commission  (MFC),  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  \n(USFS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  Water quality sampling \nand monitoring activities have been conducted by the Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental  Quality  (MDEQ)  and  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS),  and  \noperations  of  land  and  wildlife  management  areas  have  been  conducted  by  \nMDWFP,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  and  others.    Recently,  \nlocal  non-profit  and  citizen  based  groups  such  as  the  Pascagoula  River  Basin  \nAlliance,  Audubon  Society,  and  Nature  Conservancy  have  been  particularly  \neffective  in  raising  public  awareness  of  conservation  values  in  the  watershed.    \nThe  growing  public  awareness  combined  with  the  nature  and  condition  of  the  \nnatural  resources  in  this  watershed  has  spurred  the  development  of  the  WIT  in  \nSeptember of 2006 and the development of the WIP.   \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              30                                                                              \n5.2      INTEREST IN WATERSHED \n \nThe   Chunky-Okatibbee   Watershed   is   a   treasure   in   East   Mississippi   and   \ncontributes  to  our  culture,  heritage,  and  way  of  life.    Over  one  hundred  people  \nhave indicated an interest in this watershed and have agreed to serve on the WIT \nand   countless   others   have   demonstrated   interest   in   the   watershed   via   \nstakeholder   meetings,   questionnaires,   and   direct   communication.      Through   \ncontinuous  and  ongoing  recruitment  efforts,  we  encourage  new  members  to  the  \nWIT.  The WIT can be modified through an informal process of indicating interest.  \nNot  only  is  water  quality  an  issue  of  extreme  importance  to  the  residents  in  this  \nfive-county  region;  it  is  important  to  all  watersheds  downstream.    As  previously  \nmentioned,  the  Chunky-Okatibbee  Watershed  serves  as  the  headwaters  for  the  \neastern   portion   of   the   Pascagoula   River   Basin;   therefore,   water   quality   \nimpairment occurring upstream has an affect on waters as far south as the Gulf \nof Mexico.    \n \nThe Land Trust has taken on this project in the hope of realizing the creation of a \nsustainable environment in East Mississippi, and it plans to utilize this watershed \nmanagement  program  “to  conserve,  promote,  and  protect  the  open  spaces  and  \ngreen  places  of  ecological,  cultural  or  scenic  significance.”    We  believe  the  \npromotion,  development,  and  implementation  of  non-structural  and  structural  \npractices will increase awareness and interest in our watershed and ignite water \nquality improvement.   \n5.3      W\nATER QUANTITY \n \nThe  watershed  is  currently  experiencing  no  shortage  of  surface  or  groundwater  \nquantity.  According to MDEQ, this area is characterized as having a good supply \nof  groundwater  available  and  no  projections  of  shortages  are  currently  known.    \nThe majority of the drinking water supply is satisfied through publicly maintained \ngroundwater  wells  and  distribution  facilities.    MDEQ  has  established  a  source  \nwater protection policy.  The protection area around every public well extends to \na  five-year  time  of  travel  period.    An  interactive  map  providing  information  on  \nsource   water   protection   areas   can   be   found   on   MDEQ’s   website   at   \nhttp://landandwater.deq.ms.gov/swap/onlinemaps/viewer.asp\n.    Factors  affecting  \nwater quantity are primarily associated with land use, which is largely rural in this \nwatershed.    The  rural  land  use  is  dominated  by  timber  production  of  various  \ntypes and is generally thought to not impact overall water quantity.   \n5.4      W\nATER CONSERVATION \n \nWater  conservation  activities  in  the  watershed  have  been  primarily  focused  on  \nfarming  practices,  and  many  of  these  focus  on  drainage  improvements  for  \nagriculture.      These   programs   have   traditionally   included   practices   such   \nimpoundment of water for crop irrigation.  A statewide effort has been underway \nto promote water conservation in households, businesses and industry.   \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              31                                                                              \n5.5      WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES \n \nRecreational uses associated with wildlife and fisheries accounts for the majority \nof actual natural resource conservation activities in the watershed.  Hunting and \nfishing are both widely popular in the watershed among locals and also serve to \nattract visitors to the area.  Important recreational species include whitetail deer, \nredeye  bass,  and  crappie.    MDWFP  lists  Okatibbee  Lake  as  one  of  the  State’s  \nbest  spots  for  crappie.    In  fact,  last  year  the  crappie  catch  accounted  for  \napproximately  77%  of  fishing  activity  in  the  lake,  with  an  average  catch  rate  of  \n2.5 fish per hour at an average of 0.65 pounds per fish.  The only environmental \nmanagement  area  within  the  watershed  is  the  Okatibbee  Wildlife  Management  \narea.    The  Chunky  and  Okatibbee  are  both  popular  with  light  tackle  sport  \nfishermen  for  Kentucky  redeye,  or  spotted  bass,  and  also  support  catches  of  \ncatfish  and  bream.    Other  smaller  impoundments  in  the  watershed  such  as  \nBonita  Lakes  support  outdoor  recreation  activities  such  as  fishing,  and  boating.    \nOther  quality  outdoor  recreation  areas  in  the  watershed  include  the  Okatibbee  \nWildlife Management Area surrounding Okatibbee Reservoir and Bonita Lakes in \nLauderdale  County.    Other  waters  of  interest  in  this  watershed  were  previously  \nprovided in Section 3.1. \n \nNo specific fish consumption advisories have been established for streams in the \nwatershed, but there is a national advisory for mercury in effect.  The largely un-\ndammed  channels,  range  of  stream  gradients,  and  variation  of  substrate  and  \nother habitat conditions support a diversity of non-game aquatic species as well.  \nOccurrence  of  the  federally-protected  gulf  sturgeon  has  been  documented  near  \nthe   convergence   of   the   Chunky   and   Okatibbee   at   the   formation   of   the   \nChickasawhay  River.    Additionally,  the  protected  pearl  darter  has  documented  \noccurrence in the watershed.  A list of documented fish species occurring within \nthe watershed is included as attachment \n5.6      W\nATER QUALITY \n5.6.1   NARRATIVE OF WATER QUALITY ISSUES \n \nMost  of  the  15,000  miles  of  streams,  rivers,  and  lakes  in  the  Pascagoula  River  \nBasin are classified as fish and wildlife streams and are intended for fishing and \npropagation  of  fish  and  aquatic  life  and  wildlife.    These  streams  and  rivers  are  \nalso  designated  secondary  contact  recreation.    Many  are  also  classified  as  \nrecreational  and  are  intended  for  swimming,  skiing  and  support  of  other  contact  \nrecreational activities.   \n \nGeneral   water   quality   threats   within   the   watershed   include   urbanization,   \nagriculture, silvaculture, and mining.  More specific pollutants of concern are non-\npoint   sources   of   pollution   such   as   polluted   runoff   from   impervious   areas,   \nsediment   and   silt,   pathogens   associated   with   leaking   septic   systems   in   \nunsewered areas, pathogens associated with animal waste, fertilizers, pesticides, \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              32                                                                              \nand mercury. Specific threats or concerns for particular waterbodies are detailed \nin this section. \n \nThe  issue  of  concern  associated  with  Okatibbee  Creek  is  biological  impairment  \n(nutrients, sediment/siltation, suspended solids, pH, and pathogens).  According \nto  the  MDEQ’s  Pascagoula  River  Basin  Status  Report  of  2001,  17  miles  along  \nthis waterbody do not meet the designated use for secondary contact recreation, \nand two TMDLs have been approved for Okatibbee Creek for pathogens to date. \nThe  Okatibbee  Creek’s  aquatic  life  water  quality  condition  rating  is  identified  as  \ngood. \n \nWater quality impairment associated with the Sowashee Creek is also biological \nimpairment.  The  Sowashee  Creek’s  aquatic  life  water  quality  condition  rating  is  \nlisted as poor for approximately half of its length and fair for the other half.   \n \nThe pollutants of concern in the Chunky River are animal waste, pathogens, and \nsediment.  Chunky  Creek’s  aquatic  life  water  quality  condition  rating  is  identified  \nas poor but the majority of the Chunky River is identified as fair.   \n \nAquatic  life  support  has  been  threatened  in  Richardson  Mill  and  Potterchitto  \nCreeks  by  biological  impairment,  nutrients,  organic  enrichment,  low  dissolved  \noxygen,  and  unionized  ammonia.    In  addition,  habitat  alterations  due  to  erosion  \nand siltation pose a threat.  These creeks are considered impaired near Newton \nfrom  the  headwaters  through  the  mouth  at  Potterchitto  Creek  to  Potterchitto  \nCreek  at  I-20  east  of  Newton.  Due  to  the  impairment  a  Total  Daily  Maximum  \nDaily  Load,  or  TMDL,  for  this  stream  segment  has  been  developed  for  organic  \nenrichment  and  ammonia,  which  establishes  that  no  further  inputs  that  would  \nincrease the levels organic enrichment and ammonia.   \n5.6.2   D\nESIGNATED USE CLASSIFICATIONS AND WATER QUALITY STANDARDS \n \nIn  addition  to  those  waterbodies  specifically  listed  in  the  table  below,  all  \nwaterbodies  within  this  watershed  have  a  designated  use  classification  as  Fish  \nand Wildlife. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              33                                                                              \n \n \nWaterbody \nDesignated \nUse \nWater Quality \nStandard for Use \nAquatic life support \nthreshold   M-BISQ \nscore \nChunky River \n(from Highway 80 \nto Chickasawhay \nRiver) \nRecreation \nPlease refer to 305(b) \nreports located at \nwww.deq.state.ms.us\n61.18 (Least Disturbed \nAreas) and 57.91 \n(Other Areas) \nOkatibbee Creek \nSecondary \nContact \nPlease refer to 305(b) \nreports located at \nwww.deq.state.ms.us\n64.86 (Least Disturbed \nAreas) and 74.50 and \n44.80 (Other Areas) \nSowashee \nAquatic Life \nSupport \nPlease refer to 305(b) \nreports located at \nwww.deq.state.ms.us\n36.73 (Other Areas) \nOkatibbee \nReservoir \nPublic Water \nSupply \nPlease refer to 305(b) \nreports located at \nwww.deq.state.ms.us\nNA \nOkatibbee \nReservoir \nRecreation \nPlease refer to 305(b) \nreports located at \nwww.deq.state.ms.us\nNA \nPotterchitto Creek \nFish and \nWildlife \nPlease refer to 305(b) \nreports located at \nwww.deq.state.ms.us\n66.34 (Least Disturbed \nAreas) \nBonita Reservoir \nPubic Water \nSupply \nPlease refer to 305(b) \nreports located at \nwww.deq.state.ms.us\nNA \nAll waterbodies of \nconcern within the \nOkatibbee-Chunky \nWatershed \nFish and \nWildlife \nPlease refer to 305(b) \nreports located at \nwww.deq.state.ms.us\nNA \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              34                                                                              \n5.6.3   Water Quality Status and TMDLs \n \nData regarding water quality impairment is provided as Appendix D and TMDLs \nare  provided  in  Appendix  E.

The mapping efforts will include consolidation of existing information \nas well as development of additional information as appropriate.  The purpose of \nthe  mapping  efforts  will  be  to  provide  a  thorough  documentation  of  existing  \nconditions  within  the  watershed  as  well  as  serving  as  an  effective  illustration  of  \nwatershed  features.    The  mapping  information  will  provide  a  number  of  indirect  \nbenefits through the value the information will have for planning, education, and \nassessment  efforts  that  are  part  of  the  WIP.    Creation  of  the  maps  will  begin  \nimmediately  and  will  be  on-going  as  additional  mapping  information  is  obtained  \nor generated.  The effectiveness of this measure will be determined in large part \nby the direct usefulness for development and implementation of related actions of \nthe WIP.   \n6.2.2   A\nCTIVITIES \n \nThe  Land  Trust  has  initiated  preparation  of  maps  of  the  watershed  based  on  \ncurrently  available  sources  of  mapping  information.    Poster  sized  maps  of  the  \nentire  watershed  were  created  and  are  currently  being  used  in  conjunction  with  \nnumerous presentations to local citizen and stakeholder groups in efforts to gain \nlocal   input.      The   preliminary   mapping   has   included   retrieval   of   mapping   \ninformation  and  GIS  information  from  readily  available  sources  such  as  U.S.  \nGeological  Survey  (USGS),  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA),  \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              39                                                                              \nand Mississippi Automated Resource Information System (MARIS).  The amount \nof  mapping  and  related  information  is  anticipated  to  grow  with  contributions  of  \nadditional information.   \n \nDevelopment   of   a   GIS   database   for   the   watershed   is   planned   to   assist   \nmanagement of the mapping information.  Existing data regarding water quality, \nconservation areas, wildlife and fishery resources, parcel ownership and land use \ncontributed  by  resource  agencies  will  be  compiled  and  used  to  help  establish  \nhistoric  and  baseline  conditions,  identify  existing  issues  and  concerns,  develop  \neducational  materials,  plan  for  additional  monitoring,  and  evaluate  and  select  \nBMPs.    Information  identified  through  additional  mapping  and  monitoring  will  be  \nincorporated  into  the  database.    The  mapping  and  GIS  information  will  be  \navailable to the WIT for application in accomplishing actions of the WIP.   \n6.2.3   P\nARTICIPANTS \nThe following activities are proposed according to the listed participant. \n \nEMFLT  Eco-Systems,  acting  through  the  Land  Trust  will  compile  mapping  \ninformation  and  assist  in  creation  of  a  GIS  database  for  the  \nwatershed.

Development   of   a   GIS   \ndatabase has been initiated and the baseline map is anticipated to be completed \nby  June  2007.    Due  to  the  nature  of  many  of  the  actions  proposed  in  the  WIP,  \naspects  of  the  mapping  and  database  development  will  continue  throughout  the  \nterm of the project.   \n6.2.5   B\nUDGET \n \nThe  budget  for  this  item  includes  time  for  collection  and  compilation  of  existing  \nGIS  data  as  well  as  incorporating  newly  collected  data  into  the  GIS  database.    \nThe budget for Watershed Mapping is anticipated to be at $10,000.00. \n \n6.3      R\nECREATION ACCESS \n6.3.1   DESIRED BENEFITS \n \nThe  watershed  contains  publicly  managed  lakes  and  water  parks  offering  \nboating,  fishing,  camping  and  swimming  as  well  as  miles  of  public  streams  with  \nopportunities  for  fishing  and  canoeing.    However,  the  recreational  opportunities  \npresent in the watershed are felt by many stakeholders to be under-utilized with \nmany  in  need  of  improvement.    Improving  access  for  recreation,  as  well  as  \npromoting  the  numerous  recreational  opportunities  in  the  watershed  will  help  \nstimulate  utility  of  the  recreational  resources.    The  Land  Trust  actively  seeks  to  \nsecure  conservation  and  public  access  easements  to  help  promote  not  only  \nwater  quality  but  water  access  for  recreational  uses.    Increased  awareness  and  \nutilization of the recreational resources will not only provide a direct social benefit \nto the local community but will also have a direct economic effect with increases \nin tourism dollars spent. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              41                                                                              \n6.3.2   ACTIVITIES \n \nIn an effort to ensure that access to outdoor recreational opportunities within the \nwatershed  remain  available,  it  is  important  to  gain  an  understanding  of  where  \nopportunities  currently  exist  and  where  newly  created  opportunities  would  be  \nmost  beneficial.    To  achieve  the  goal  of  maximizing  recreational  opportunities  \nwithin  the  watershed,  a  watershed  management  plan  will  be  developed.    The  \ndevelopment of the plan will involve three primary activities. \n \nThe  first  activity  necessary  to  plan  for  outdoor  recreation  within  the  watershed  \ninvolves mapping and photographing existing recreational access sites within the \nwatershed.    This  will  provide  the  spatial  knowledge  necessary  for  successful  \nplanning and will also provide information needed to assess the effectiveness of \nexisting  recreational  opportunities.    Once  the  existing  sites  have  been  identified  \nand  evaluated,  a  spatial  analysis  of  the  entire  watershed  will  be  conducted  to  \ndetermine the need for new sites and potential sites for acquisition to create new \npublic  access  areas.    Finally,  a  strategy  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  \nproblems such as littering, graffiti and erosion don’t occur with new and existing \nsites. \n6.3.3   P\nARTICIPANTS \nThe following activities are proposed according to the listed participant. \n \nEMFLT Will pursue streamside easements and access point easements to \nhelp protect the streams for conservation and recreation purposes.  \nThe  Land  Trust  can  provide  assistance  with  improvement  and  \nmanagement of access points.   \n \nMDWFP   Provide   assistance   with   identifying   and   monitoring   fisheries   \nresource  conditions.    MDWFP  has  a  variety  of  grant  programs  \navailable that can be used to fund site improvements such as boat \nramps, fishing piers, and other park amenities.  \n \nPHWD  Will  provide  assistance  with  identifying  and  promoting  recreational  \nopportunities.   \n \nUSACE  Will  provide  assistance  with  identifying  and  promoting  recreational  \nopportunities.    The  USACE  may  also  have  funding  available  to  \nassist with site development. \n \nBOS  In  some  cases,  the  use  of  grant  funding  will  necessitate  that  the  \ncounties  in  question  retain  ownership  of  access  sites.    In  these  \ncases, the Boards of Supervisors can assist with acquisition of key \nsites and facilitate grant funding and administration.   \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              42                                                                              \n6.3.4   SCHEDULE \n \nPotential  access  points  for  improvement  will  be  identified  by  fall  or  winter  2007.    \nImprovements  and  pursuit  of  easements  for  selected  access  points  will  be  \ncompleted by December 2008, as appropriate.   \n6.3.5   B\nUDGET \n \nThe budget for this task will vary based on the number of new sites identified and \nthe level of improvement necessary for existing sites.  Budgetary needs may also \nbe offset by the successful acquisition of grant funding to pay for amenities and \nimprovement.    The  overall  budget  (not  including  land  acquisition  or  cost  of  \nconservation easements) is anticipated to be approximately $35,000. \n \nLand  acquisition  and  conservation  easements  costs  will  depend  on  the  number  \nof  public  access  points  targeted  and  the  cost  associated  with  the  establishment  \nof new access points or conservation areas to be used for recreation purposes.   \n6.4      L\nITTER AND DUMPING \n6.4.1   DESIRED BENEFITS \n \nLitter  and  other  materials  that  are  carelessly  or  intentionally  deposited  in  our  \nwater bodies are in direct contradiction to the scenic and recreational attributes of \nour  streams.    Not  only  does  litter  and  illegal  dumping  pose  a  serious  threat  to  \nwater  quality  and  the  greater  aquatic  ecosystem,  but  they  also  damage  public  \nperception   of   the   resource,   which   hinders   development   of   recreation   and   \nconservation initiatives in the watershed.   \n \nThis  action  will  seek  to  reduce  the  inputs  of  litter  and  other  objectionable  \nmaterials,  physically  remove  litter  and  other  objectionable  materials  from  the  \nwater  bodies,  and  provide  improvement  of  water  quality  through  reduction  in  \ninputs of harmful substances and materials.  The success of this measure is tied \nto the identification of littering hot spots and dumping sites and hosting clean-up \nevents.  Stricter enforcement of ordinances and strategically-placed signage may \nalso  be  practices  utilized  to  control  litter  and  illegal  dumping.    General  public  \neducation  as  mentioned  in  Section  7  will  reinforce  this  management  effort  by  \nincreasing  awareness  of  water  quality  impairment  associated  with  litter  and  \ndumping.  Educational practices will focus on prevention as well as response. \n6.4.2   A\nCTIVITIES \n \nThe  presence  of  illegal  dumping  sites  along  bridge  crossings  and  stream  banks  \nis  seen  as  a  significant  detraction  to  recreational  use  and  a  detriment  to  water  \nquality.  One goal is to organize and conduct stream clean-up activities.  Another \ngoal  is  to  identify  the  location  and  nature  of  illegal  dumping  sites  in  the  \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              43                                                                              \nwatershed.  Types of materials present can be inventoried, if appropriate, to aid \nin  targeted  education  and  public  awareness  measures.    Materials  from  selected  \ndump  sites  should  be  removed  and  properly  disposed  of,  and  the  dump  site  \nsecured  as  appropriate  to  discourage  future  dumping.    State  and  local  law  \nenforcement  officials  will  be  employed  to  investigate  and  prosecute  violators  if  \nknown.    Inputs  of  floatable  litter  from  urbanized  areas  of  Meridian  have  been  \nsuggested  as  a  major  source  of  objectionable  materials  present  in  Sowashee  \nand  Okatibbee  Creeks.    Measures  to  reduce  inputs  and  structural  control  \nmeasures  to  screen  floatable  materials  may  also  be  considered  to  address  the  \nconcern.   \n6.4.3   P\nARTICIPANTS \nThe following activities are proposed according to the listed participant. \n \nEMFLT  Coordinate  identification  and  investigation  of  litter  hot  spots  and  \nillegal dumping sites in the watershed.

The  purpose  is  to  ensure  that  areas  of  the  watershed  \ncharacterized   as   having   environmental   and/or   cultural   significance   will   be   \nprotected  for  future  generations.    Because  of  limited  budgets  for  acquisition  \nactivities,  the  Land  Trust  intends  to  be  very  judicious  in  its  selection  of  sites  for  \nacquisition.    However,  the  Land  Trust  intends  to  position  itself  within  the  \nwatershed as a resource for the donation of critical habitat areas by landowners \nwho  desire  to  see  these  lands  preserved  in  a  manner  that  will  ensure  the  long-\nterm integrity of the sites. \n6.6.2   A\nCTIVITIES \n  \nActivities  associated  with  the  establishment  of  conservation  easements  and  \nbuffer zones will closely correlate with other activities detailed in this plan such as \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              46                                                                              \nimprovements  to  recreational  access.    Activities  will  involve  an  analysis  of  the  \nwatershed  to  determine  specific  lands  to  target,  prioritization  of  available  lands,  \nand negotiations with landowners and stakeholders. \n6.6.3   P\nARTICIPANTS \n \nEMFLT   The   Land   Trust   will   actively   seek   to   establish   conservation   \neasements at key recreational access points and also on lands that \nare  demonstrated  to  have  unique  environmental  qualities  that  \nwarrant preservation. \n \nMDEQ Will participate in the process of easement acquisition by providing \ninformation on prioritized sites relative to the sites’ environmental or \nrecreation qualities. \n \nMDWFP  Will  provide  information  to  the  Land  Trust  regarding  locations  of  \npriority conservation sites.

It is anticipated that the progression of this task will be closely \nrelated  to  the  Recreational  Access  task  and  other  tasks  such  as  watershed  \nmapping.   \n \n6.6.5   B\nUDGET \n \nThe  budget  for  this  task  is  dependent  in  part  on  negotiations  with  landowners  \nseeking   to   place   conservation   easements   on   targeted   properties.      Other   \ncomponents  of  the  budget  will  include  analysis  of  spatial  data  to  determine  \ntargeted  properties  and  the  identification  of  sites.    Budgets  associated  with  \nacquisition of conservation easements and buffer zones will be dependent on the \nprice  to  purchase  desired  land  and  to  establish  such  easements  and  buffer  \nzones.  The estimated cost is $55,000 but serves only as a best estimate based \non unknown quantity of acres to be placed in conservation easements. \n \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              47                                                                              \n7.0      EDUCATION OUTREACH ACTIVITIES \n \n7.1      OBJECTIVES \n \nThe   objective   of   the   public   \neducation   component   of   the   \nChunky-Okatibbee    Watershed    \nImplementation        Plan        is        \ndesigned  to  increase  the  level  \nof    awareness    of    watershed    \nissues    such    as    impacts    of    \nhuman    activities    on    water    \nquality  impairment  not  only  in  \nthe   immediate   watershed   but   \nalso  in  the  entire  Pascagoula  \nRiver  Basin  and  beyond.

The  Educational  Committee  will  initially  focus  on  attempting  to  \nsecure  highway  signs.    Highway  signs  could  be  erected  at  major  highway  \nentrances  into  the  watershed  to  notify  drivers  that  they  are  “now  entering  the  \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed”.  These signs could be erected  where  Highways  \n15,  19,  39,  45,  11,  80  and  Interstates  20  and  59  enter  into  the  watershed  from  \neither direction.  The initial focus will target the erection of sixteen signs.  Other \nsigns will be considered but will be contingent on the availability of funding.  The \nfollowing table illustrates the frequency of potential exposure of the signs based \non average daily traffic counts at major highways within the watershed. \n \nHighway Direction Average Daily Traffic Count \nHighway 15 North 4,300\nHighway 15 South 1,800\nHighway 19 North 5,500\nHighway 19 South 3,800\nInterstate 20 West 19,000\nInterstate 59 South 10,000\nInterstate 20/59 East 25,000\nHighway 80 West 2,200\nHighway 80 East 2,300\nHighway 11 South 570\nHighway 45 North 8,700\nHighway 45 South 4,300\nHighway 39 North 4,400\nTotals91,870\n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              55                                                                              \n7.7.1   PARTICIPATION \nThe following activities are proposed according to the listed participant. \n \nEMFLT In cooperation with the cities and counties within the watershed, the \nLand  Trust  will  determine  strategic  locations  for  placement  of  the  \nsigns. \n \nMDOT MDOT will provide technical assistance specific to the placement of \nsignage  within  the  watershed.

The  self-guided  tour  could  highlight  unique  features  \nwithin  the  watershed  and  could  also  serve  as  a  guide  for  eco-tourism  activities  \nsuch as bird watching, canoeing, camping, hiking, and fishing. \n7.8.1   P\nARTICIPATION \nThe following activities are proposed according to the listed participant. \n \nEMFLT  Lead  in  developing  the  tour  routes  and  will  include  information  \nspecific to the tours in other materials to be developed including the \nbrochures, the tabletop display and the website. \n \nCanoe Club   Provide recommendations for key canoeing routes. \n \nAudubon Provide locations of birding sites.  \n \nMWFP  Provide  information  regarding  trails,  recreational  areas,  parks,  and  \nother significant locations of interest. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              56                                                                              \n7.8.2   SCHEDULE \n \nThe  process  of  developing  tour  routes  will  begin  in  2007  with  publication  of  the  \nroutes   to   be   conducted   in   conjunction   with   other   education   elements   as   \ndescribed above. \n7.8.3   B\nUDGET \n \nThe  budget  for  development  and  promotion  of  eco-tours  is  anticipated  to  be  at  \n$5,000. \n\nWatershed Implementation Plan \nChunky-Okatibbee Watershed Project \nMay 2007 \n                                                                                                                                                            Page                                                                              57                                                                              \n8.0      PLAN EVALUATION \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised, if necessary, \nonce  per  year  throughout  the  proposed  three-year  implementation  schedule.    \nThe purpose of annual evaluations is to ensure that the provisions of the plan are \nhaving the intended effect and to ensure that the goals and objectives of the plan \nare being met.  In the event that the intended results are not being achieved, the \nplan will be revised as appropriate.  It is anticipated  that  the  review  process  will  \nbegin during the third quarter of each calendar year. \n \nThe  review  process  will  involve  a  meeting  of  the  WIT  to  discuss  and  review  \nprogress  made  during  the  previous  year  as  determined  by  on-going  monitoring  \nconducted  throughout  the  year.    During  that  meeting,  the  team  will  determine  if  \nrecommendations  need  to  be  made  concerning  the  revision  of  the  plan.    Once  \nthose determinations have been made, participating stakeholders will be notified \nof the intended revisions and will be given an opportunity to review and comment \non  the  proposed  revisions.
