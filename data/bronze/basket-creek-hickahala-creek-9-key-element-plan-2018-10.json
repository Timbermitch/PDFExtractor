The identification of water bodies not meeting their designated \nuse and the development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for those water bodies are \nrequired by Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) of the Environmental Protection \nAgency’s (EPA) Water Quality Planning and Management Regulation (40 CFR part 130). The \nTMDL process is designated to restore and maintain the quality of those impaired water bodies \nthrough the establishment of pollutant specific allowable loads.  Hickahala Creek Drainage Area \n(DA) (MS305E) was included on MS’s 1996 and 1998 Section 303(d) List as an “evaluated” \nimpairment versus “monitored” impairment as there were no water quality data to verify \nimpairment status of the stream.  In 2000, MDEQ developed a comprehensive biological \nmonitoring program to add another assessment tool their monitoring program as well as address \nthe large number of “evaluated” water bodies on the state’s Section 303(d) List.  As part of this \neffort, a robust multi-metric benthic macroinvertebrate index, the Mississippi Benthic Index of \nStream Quality (M-BISQ), was developed for wadeable streams outside of the MS Alluvial \nPlain.  Using biological data, the evaluated listings for pesticides and sedimentation/siltation \nwere replaced with biological impairment.  The biological impairment was determined to be \ncaused by nutrients and organic enrichment/low dissolved oxygen and in 2003, a TMDL was \ndeveloped to address those pollutants.    \n \nA segment of Hickahala Creek (MS305M2) was also included on the “monitored” portion of \nMS’s 1998 Section 303(d) List of Impaired Water Bodies.  This segment, along with a segment \nof James-Wolf Creek (MS305M1) that flows into the watershed and confluences with Hickahala \nCreek from the southwest, was assessed as impaired for recreational use due to high levels of \nfecal coliform in the water.  A fecal coliform TMDL for Hickahala Creek was developed in 2003 \nto address the pathogen impairment.  Figure 2 shows the extent of all three impaired reaches in \nthe watershed (MS305E, MS305M2, and MS305M1).   \n \nThere are five facilities in the Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek watershed listed with NPDES \npermits.  Only two of the five permits remain active.   \n \n  \n\nBasket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Plan GY 2017 \n2 \n \n.\n \nFigure 1: Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Landuse Map, 2011 NLCD \n\nBasket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Plan GY 2017 \n3 \n \n \nFigure 2: Basket Creek Segments (MS305E, MS305M1, and MS305M2)  \n\nBasket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Plan GY 2017 \n4 \n \n \nElement b: Expected Load Reduction \n \nThe TMDL for Organic Enrichment, Low DO, and Nutrients for Hickahala and Senatobia \nCreeks (MS305E), which encompasses Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed, states that \nrestrictions on NPDES permitting activities will be put in place. These restrictions will ensure \nthe maximum load of TBODu specified in the TMDL of 1,317 lbs/day will not be exceeded.  \nTherefore, no further action will need to be implemented to meet the standards of this TMDL.  \nAs part of the TMDL development process, the NPS load was estimated using assumed \nbackground concentrations of CBODu and NH\n3\n-N.  In order to achieve the modeled NPS loads \nin the TMDL, nutrient BMPs will be implemented watershed.  This will be done by \nimplementing in-field conservation practices that target both TN, TP and sediment reduction as \nsoils in MS are known to have high phosphorus content.   \n \nThe Fecal Coliform TMDL for Hickahala Creek is calling for a 50% reduction in the section of \nHickahala Creek that is located within the Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed.  The same \nTMDL also calls for a 70% reduction in James Wolf Creek.  This creek flows into Hickahala \nCreek from the southeast.  According to the TMDL, no future impacts are expected to water \nquality from permitted facilities as long as the effluent is disinfected to meet water quality \nstandards for pathogens.  Following regulation, MDEQ will not approve any NPDES permit \napplication that does not plan to meet water quality standards for disinfection.  In order to \nmitigate any NPS contributors to pathogens in the watershed, the watershed team will work to \nidentify opportunities to implement BMPs on pasturelands and lands used for grazing to limit \nlivestock access to streams.   \n \nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service has a list of approved BMPs to address nutrients, \nsedimentation and pathogens.  This list will be used to identify candidate BMPs to be installed in \nthe Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed.   \n \nElement c: Proposed Management Measures \n \nCoordinating partners with MDEQ include the Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation \nCommission (MSWCC), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the local Soil \nand Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) throughout the state.  These SWCDs are typically \nhoused within USDA Service Centers co-located with NRCS offices.  These USDA Service \nCenters handle federal assistance programs offered through the Farm Bill.  As part of these \nservices, SWCD staff communicate regularly with the local landowners and operators within the \nwatershed as they work to support sign-ups for Farm Bill initiatives   Staff from MSWCC and \nthe SWCD depend upon assistance from their NRCS partners in determining landowner interest \nin the watershed because they are on the farms and in the fields with the landowners, understand \nthe needs at the local level, and have knowledge of the amount of unfunded applications for \nfederal program assistance which meet Section 319 eligibility requirements.  Based on their \nanalysis, installation of the following BMPs would mitigate sediment and nutrient issues in the \nBasket Creek-Hickahala Creek watershed helping the stream recover: fencing, watering \nfacilities, heavy use areas, ponds, streambank and shoreline protection, and grade stabilization \nstructures.  As such, BMPs will be prioritized for implementation in the newly converted pasture \n\nBasket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Plan GY 2017 \n5 \n \nareas.  Factors considered for determining specific locations for the placement of BMPs included \nthe following attributes based upon best professional judgement: \n \n1. Likely water quality benefit; \n2. Willing landowners; \n3. Implementation of the recommendations of the TMDLs (this includes implementation \nof BMPs appropriate for nutrients, sediment, and pathogens); \n4. Ease of showing effectiveness of the BMP(s) through monitoring; \n5. Shorter length of time for anticipated results (i.e., within the grant period); \n \n \nElement d: Technical and Financial Assistance \n \nAs part of any Section 319 funded project, MDEQ requires a 40% match in project areas.  This \nmatch may be in the form of actual dollars or may be provided as “in-kind” to project activities.  \nPartners in this project that may contribute match include MSWCC, Tate County Soil and Water \nConservation District, NRCS, USGS (monitoring), and/or local landowners.  For project \nimplementation, administration, management, and watershed plan revision, as well as hosting \nand facilitating team meetings, MDEQ plans to work under a memorandum of agreement (MOA) \nwith the MSWCC to implement this project.  Project partners provided the funding amounts used \nto estimate costs for BMP installation.

Audiences from pre-school to adults throughout the state are reached with a \nvariety of mature, well-designed programs each year. These programs, events, manuals and \nliterature can be used in the Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek watershed project by tailoring them \nto address the pollutants addressed in the TMDLs.  A positive approach is used to reach the full \ndiversity of people in the community with projects that foster a “sense of place”, a “sense of \npride in community”, and a sense of the native plants, animals, and general ecology of their \nregion, as well as, the history of the community and a sense of economics.  Stakeholders and \ncoordinators join together to participate in problem-solving, brainstorming, plan development, \ntraining workshops, festival event planning, soil and water conservation field days, tree boards, \nposter, art and writing projects and other activities that promote collaboration and ownership of \nthe watershed, as well as, solutions to its problems.  The ultimate goal is to bring about behavior \nchanges and the use of “best management practices” that will improve water quality and the \noverall quality of life in the watershed.  Evaluation forms, pre-test/ post-test, surveys, and \nreporting of the number of people who attend workshops, trainings and events are among the \nmethods used to measure the success of education/information programs.  A partial list of \nMDEQ’s programs that could be used in the Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek watershed are listed \nbelow: \n \n Water Model Presentations - Enviroscapes and groundwater aquifer models distributed \nstatewide with training and related interactive lesson plans. \n Teacher Workshops – train educators in proximity to the watershed about NPS pollution \nand provide materials and information that can be used in their classrooms. \n Adopt A Stream - workshops and training venues for citizens, teachers, and students in \nthe Dry Creek Watershed. \n  Watershed Harmony Mobile Classroom - for ages kindergarten – adults with state and \nfederal public education objectives tailored for 4\nth\n and 5\nth\n grade students. \n Storm Drain Marking - projects for scouts, environmental clubs, and citizen groups. \n “Train the Trainer” - workshops and materials for Soil and Water districts, Extension \nService, etc. \n \nAs part of the education outreach efforts, the stakeholder group forming the Basket Creek-\nHickahala Creek Watershed Implementation Team (WIT) will participate in a minimum of 3 \nface-to-face meetings.  The purpose of these meetings is to provide updates on implementation \nactivities, education events and review and modify the watershed plan.  In concert with these \nWIT meetings, and to incentivize stakeholder participation, project funding will be used to \npurchase food and other refreshments for the WIT along with providing support for renting \nfacilities in which to host those events.  In accordance with 41 CFR § 301-74.11, light \nrefreshments, meals, and/or beverages are an allowable expense under CWA Section 319, \n\nBasket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Plan GY 2017 \n7 \n \nprovided a description of the agenda, purpose, location, costs, etc., are outlined in an approved \n319 grant workplan. The purpose of the meetings will be for updating the watershed plan, and \nhosting field days to showcase the implemented BMPs for the public. At this time the exact \nnumber of participants and locations are not known therefore costs have been estimated for the \npurposes of this plan and will be updated. \n \nElement f: Implementation Schedule \n \nIn the event of a Section 319 NPS funding award from MDEQ to support implementation of this \nwatershed-based plan for this HUC 12 sub-watershed, MDEQ, along with support from the \nWatershed Implementation Team and Project Manager (where applicable), will: \n1.

There is no numeric criteria applicable to aquatic life \nprotection due to nutrients/organic enrichment. However, a narrative standard for the protection \nof aquatic life does apply to all waters in the state.  The narrative standard is that waters shall be \nfree from materials attributable to municipal, industrial, agricultural, or other dischargers \nproducing color, odor, taste, total suspended solids, or other conditions in such degree as to \ncreate a nuisance, render the waters injurious to public health, recreation, or to aquatic life and \nwildlife, or adversely affect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any \ndesignated uses.  In lieu of numeric criteria for nutrients, the monitoring will be conducted to \ncollect data on nutrient parameters as well as parameters that are considered response measures \nfor nutrient concentrations as well as parameters that measure dissolved oxygen and oxygen \n\nBasket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Plan GY 2017 \n9 \n \ndemand.  These parameters may include measurements for: Dissolved Oxygen, Dissolved \nOxygen Percent Saturation (%Sat), Chemical Oxygen Demand, Total Nitrogen (TN), Total \nPhosphorus (TP), and turbidity along with conventional parameters generally measured to \ndetermine aquatic health (e.g. pH, Temperature, Conductivity).  For pathogens, waters must meet \na 30-day geometric mean of 126 per 100 ml, nor should the samples examined during the 30-day \nperiod exceed 410 per 100 ml more than 105 of the time for E. coli.  The following thresholds \nwill be used to measure compliance with water quality criteria:  \n \nParameter Threshold \nDissolved Oxygen Daily Average of 5.0 mg/L; Instantaneous threshold of 4.0 mg/L \nDissolved Oxygen % Sat ≥ 70% - ≤ 125% \npH 6.0-9.0 \nTemperature Not to exceed 90°F \nSpecific Conductance Less Than 1000 micromhos/cm \nDissolved Solids \nMonthly average less than 750 mg/L; instantaneous threshold less than 1500 \nmg/L \nChemical Oxygen \nDemand 35 mg/L \nTotal Nitrogen \n0.940-1.110 mg/L (threshold range based on healthy biologically attaining \nstreams in West Bioregion) \nTotal Phosphorus \n0.080-0.120 mg/L (threshold range based on healthy biologically attaining \nstreams in West Bioregion) \nE. coli \n30-day geometric mean of 126 per 100 ml; samples during 30-day period should \nnot exceed 410 per 100 ml more than 10% of the time \n \nIn addition to chemical data, biological community data and in stream habitat surveys will be \ncollected over the course of the project to determine attainment of the Aquatic Life Designated \nUse.  These data are extremely helpful in identifying positive trends in water quality and should \nprovide information to help determine if the implementation activities are resulting in water \nquality improvements.  Mississippi use a calibrated and verified index of biotic integrity (IBI) to \nmake water quality assessment decisions referred to as the Mississippi Benthic Index of Stream \nQuality (M-BISQ).  This index, was originally developed in 2000 and has undergone three \nrecalibration efforts to refine the sensitivity of the index.  As part of the index development \nprocess, the state was divided into unique bioregions.  Within each bioregion, the index has a \ndefined attainment threshold that is used to determine if the biological community measures \ncollected at a site are representative of good water quality that can support a balanced benthic \nmacroinvertebrate community.  If the score is above the attainment threshold for the bioregion, \nthe site is assessed as attaining the aquatic life use designation.  Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek is \nin the West bioregion and the attainment threshold is 43.7.  Along with overall MBISQ scores, \nthe in-stream habitat surveys will also be used to determine change over time.     \n \nWhen biological data indicate a stream is not meeting its designate use, the stream is assessed as \nbeing biologically impaired and a stressor identification analysis is performed.  MDEQ has a \nstrong team of scientists and engineers focused on evaluating water quality data and identifying \nstressors in water bodies that have been listed as being biologically impaired using benthic \nmacroinvertebrate community data.  If biological community data indicate that a water body \n\nBasket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Plan GY 2017 \n10 \n \nsegment is impaired, an investigative, stressor identification analysis using a strength-of-\nevidence approach is conducted to determine the cause(s) of the impairment.  Such causes may \nrange from specific pollutants (e.g. Total Nitrogen) to other causes of pollution such as \nsedimentation, habitat loss or hydrologic alteration.  In most cases, nonpoint sources contribute, \nor are the primary causes of impairment.  MDEQ relies upon all available monitoring and \nassessment data and conducts additional monitoring to gather the necessary data and information \nto help determine both the causes and sources of impaired waters.  The U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) Stressor Identification Process and Stressor Identification Guidance \nDocument (USEPA, 2000), is used to identify most probable stressors causing biological \nimpairment to provide the information necessary to develop required TMDLs that will guide \nrestoration activities.   \n \nIt should be noted that recovery time of a stream is variable and may extend beyond the \ntimeframe identified in the workplan.  At the end of the project, data will be analyzed to \ndetermine if they indicate improvements to water quality in the Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek \nwatershed.  In the event data indicate little or no positive change, a Stressor Analysis will be \nconducted to determine if any new or additional stressors are preventing improvements to water \nquality.  If any new stressors are identified, the Watershed Implementation Team will identify \nfuture actions/activities to address those stressors. \n \nElement i: Monitoring \n \nPrior to BMP installation, water quality chemical and biological monitoring was conducted and \nwill serve as baseline data for the project along with any historical data available on Basket \nCreek and Hickahala Creek.  Historical monitoring stations are shown in Figure 3.  The most \nrecent biological monitoring conducted on Hickahala Creek from 2014 resulted in a M-BISQ \nscore 10 points below the attainment threshold for the West Bioregion.  Based on this \ninformation, the stream is not meeting its designated use for aquatic life use support.  This \ninformation from this sampling event, as well as older sampling data, will serve as pre-\nimplementation monitoring for the project.  Post-BMP monitoring locations will be selected \nusing best professional judgement and will be targeted to reflect water quality downstream of \nBMP activity.  Once BMP installation is complete, and there has been sufficient time for the \nstream to stabilize, post BMP monitoring will be initiated.  Post BMP monitoring will be \nconducted in a way that allows for comparison with the pre-implementation data.  Because \nrecovery periods of streams can be dependent on type and amount of BMPs installed, more than \n1 year of post BMP data may be needed to observe a change in water quality.  In some cases, it \nmay take 5 or more years to see full benefits of BMPs. All data collection efforts will be \nconducted using trained personnel following established Standard Operating Procedures and \nadhering to agency Quality Assurance protocols.   \n  \n\nBasket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Plan GY 2017 \n11 \n \n \n-  \nFigure 3: Basket Creek-Hickahala Creek Watershed Historical Monitoring Stations ",
