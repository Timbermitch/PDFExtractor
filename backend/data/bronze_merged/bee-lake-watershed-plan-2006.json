The implementation of this plan also partially fulfills\nthe mission of all members of the Bee Lake Watershed Implementation Team (WIT) including: Delta\nF.A.R.M.,  Delta  Wildlife,  Ducks  Unlimited,  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  Mississippi  Department\nof  Environmental  Quality,  Mississippi  Soil  and  Water  Conservation  Commission,  Mississippi\nDepartment  of  Wildlife,  Fisheries,  and  Parks,  Mississippi  Department  of  Health,  Mississippi  State\nUniversity  Department  of  Wildlife  and  Fisheries,  Natural  Resources  Conservation  Service,  U.S.\nGeologic  Survey,  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  Yazoo-Mississippi  Delta  Joint  Water  Management\nDistrict, all other partnering agencies and the private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the\nwatershed.\nII.BEE LAKE WATERSHED DESCRIPTION\nThere  is  some  historical  hydrological  evidence  that  Bee  Lake  could  have  been  created  by  the  Ohio\nRiver.  However, popular belief holds that Bee Lake is an oxbow created by the Yazoo River located\nin Holmes County, in western Mississippi. The watershed is approximately 11,870 acres in size (Figure\n2.1)  (Tetra  Tech  2003).    We  estimate  that  approximately  60  people  lived  in  this  watershed  in  2000\n(based on Census 2000 census block data for Holmes County). Portions of the town of Thornton and\nthe  historic  plantation  communities  of  Lakeland,  Maryland,  Gum  Grove,  Bealon,  Bonanza,  Little\nBonanza, Stonewall, Quofaloma, Jenkins and Pluto are in the Bee Lake watershed (DeLorme 1998).\nBee Lake is a popular sport fishing lake and contributes to the local economy through its fishery. The\nMississippi  Department  of  Wildlife  Fisheries  and  Parks  maintains  a  pay-to-launch  boat  ramp  on  the\nlake near Highway 49E (Tetra Tech 2003).\nThe watershed is located in the Mississippi Alluvial Plains ecoregion, and is underlain by Mississippi\nRiver Alluvium (MDEQ 2000). Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood forest con-\nsisting of oak, gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS on-line mapping accessed 7/15/04). The topog-\nraphy of the watershed is relatively flat, with only a 25-foot elevation difference between the highest\npoint (northeast watershed) and the lowest point (north central watershed). There are two major soils\nin the watershed. The majority of the soil in the watershed is of the Dundee-Forestdale-Dubbs asso-\nciation, with only a small area in the southeast of the watershed with soil in the Sharkey-Forestdale-\nDundee association (Tetra Tech 2003). These soils are very productive and easily eroded (SCS).\n11\n\nPrimary inflow to Bee Lake is through Tchula Lake (a nearby oxbow lake) during high water periods\n(typically in the spring), and outflow is through canals to the Yazoo River and an additional canal to\nlower  Tchula  Lake,  near  where  it  joins  the  Yazoo  River  (Tetra  Tech  2003).  Bee  Lake  also  receives\ninflow from field drains and improved ditches from within the watershed. Bee Lake is used as a source\nof  irrigation  water,  thus  contributing  to  the  local  agricultural  economy.  There  are  other  smaller  lakes\nand  ponds  in  the  watershed,  including  commercial  catfish  ponds  to  the  south  of  the  lake  (DeLorme\n1998, Tetra Tech 2003). The watershed is underlain by the Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer, which is\nused for additional agricultural irrigation. Drinking water is largely obtained through private wells from\nan aquifer found below the Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer (Tetra Tech 2003).  Community drinking\nwater  sources  are  currently  being  developed  as  the  West  Holmes  County  Water  Association  began\nlaying waterlines around the lake in 2005. \nIn 1993 land use in the watershed was primarily agricultural (65%), with 51% of the watershed in crop\nproduction,  and  14%  in  non-cultivated  agricultural  uses  such  as  pasture  (Figure  2.2).  Cotton  is  the\nmajor crop in the watershed, it accounts for approximately 51% of the cropland. Other crops cultivat-\ned  in  the  watershed  include  (in  order  of  abundance)  soybeans,  rice,  snap  beans,  sorghum,  winter\nwheat, small grains, corn, and sunflowers (Tetra Tech 2003).\nFigure 1.

The  soils\naround  the  lake  were  originally  deposited  by  historical  flood  events.    This  rich  soil  sustains  prof-\nitable farming operations and wildlife habitat for an abundance of terrestrial species.  The aesthet-\nic beauty of the lake and its recreational values make the watershed highly desirable for either pri-\nmary or secondary homes.  \n15\n\nBee Lake from the county bridge off U.S. Hwy. 49E\nBell Grocery is the only non-Ag related business in the watershed.\n16\n\nThe aesthetic value and the recreational opportunities also increase land values around the lake,\nfurther benefiting the landowners and county tax base.  The lake itself provides irrigation water to\nadjacent cropland and aquaculture, saving precious ground water supplies from further depletion.\nAnd the only non-ag related business in the watershed is sustained by the lake’s popularity as a\nrecreational fishery.\nIt is the unified consensus of the WIT to address each and every issue that threatens the long-term\nenvironmental and economic sustainability of this lake and watershed.\nSheet erosion from this cotton field has scoured a pathway into the lake.\nB.TECHNICAL COMMITTEE INTERESTS\nEight priority concerns have been identified in the Bee Lake Watershed.  Sedimentation from adja-\ncent agricultural runoff and the failing weir pose immediate threats to the lake.  \nBee Lake cannot continue to be a productive fishery and an irrigation water storage reservoir if the\nlake level cannot be maintained and sedimentation is not significantly reduced.  A noxious aquatic\nweed, like Alligator Weed, pose a threat to autumn dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and reduces the\navailability of open water for fishing and recreation on the lake.  \n17\n\nAlligator Weed, seen to the right, threatens dissolved oxygen levels and recreational access \non Bee Lake.\nOrganic enrichment is also a concern of the WIT and MDEQ.  However, very little data exists to\ndocument the severity, sources, and impact of organic enrichment in Bee Lake.  Therefore, the WIT\nshall recommend further monitoring of organic enrichment in Bee Lake and will restrain from pro-\nposing a plan to address the concern until more is known. \nThe WIT identified three additional concerns that impact watershed use rather than water quality.\nThese  concerns  include  future  development  around  the  lake,  fisheries  management,  and  boat\naccess.    Each  concern  must  be  carefully  addressed  in  order  to  control  future  growth  around  the\nlake, increasing fishing pressure, and associated impacts in the watershed.  All concerns are list-\ned below in Table 4.1in order of priority.\n18\n\nTable 4.1.

Three\ndirt ramps located at points around lake.\nBell’s Grocery and another location in Thornton.\nAccess affects entire lake usage.\n\nV.BEE LAKE RESOURCES\nA.WATER QUANTITY\n1. Surface Water\nThe lake has been slowly filling in due to sedimentation from adjacent cropland, thereby reducing lake\ndepth and water storage capacity for surface water irrigation interests.  A weir was constructed by con-\ncerned farmers in the 1970’s to maintain water levels for irrigation and fishing.  Despite the fact that\nthe  weir  has  been  maintained  by  local  farmers,  its  crude  construction  is  frequently  damaged  and\nthreatened by storm events and backwaters from the Yazoo River and Tchula Lake.  The weir repre-\nsents the single most important asset in the watershed.  Without the weir, recreational fishing and sur-\nface water irrigation will no longer by feasible in the watershed.  There are no other significant surface\nwater irrigation sources within the watershed.\n2. Ground Water \nIrrigation water use in this watershed is partially supplied by groundwater from the alluvial aquifer. The\nhigh carbonate levels in the groundwater makes in marginally suitable for drinking water, but suitable\nfor agricultural uses. Nutrient levels in the ground water are low, and nitrate levels are below the EPA\ndrinking water standard (Tetra Tech 2003). Heavy agricultural ground water usage has resulted in the\nlowering of the ground water table throughout the Yazoo River basin (MDEQ 2000).\n3. Conservation\nThe Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District and MDEQ permits and monitors both\nsurface  and  ground  water  irrigation  use  in  the  watershed.    Private  landowners  have  installed  water\ncontrol structures and sub-soil fields in the fall to conserve water resources.  However, no significant\nefforts have been made within the watershed to conserve water use as the topography does not lend\nitself to large scale land forming, tail-water recover construction, or surface water irrigation reservoir\nconstruction. \nB.       FISHERIES RESOURCES\nThere  are  no  threatened  or  endangered  aquatic  species  present  in  the  watershed.  However,  the\nPaddlefish is present in Bee Lake (Tetra Tech 2003) and may become threatened by commercial fish-\ning and the high demand for caviar. Game fish such as white crappie, black crappie, bluegill, redear,\nand black bass are also struggling due to high turbidity levels in the lake that impact the spawn and\nreduce overall carrying capacity. \n20\n\nWhite crappie are the most popular game fish as shown by these children from \ntheir grandparent’s fishing pier at Bee Lake.\nFurthermore,  over  fishing  threatens  game  fish  populations  as  recreational  fishing  and  bass  tourna-\nments continue to increase on the lake.   MDEQ have sampled fish populations in Bee Lake for pes-\nticide contamination, while Mississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries & Parks have historical data\non  pesticide  contamination  (MDEQ  2003a).  All  water  bodies  in  the  Delta,  including  Bee  Lake,  were\nplaced under fish consumption advisory in 2001 for DDT and Toxaphene in catfish over 22 inches and\nall sizes of carp, buffalo, and gar (MDEQ 2001).  However, fish advisories for Bee Lake were lifted after\nTMDLs for Legacy Pesticides were developed in the Yazoo River Basin (MDEQ 2005).  Alligator Weed\nand other noxious aquatic vegetation also threaten Bee Lake.  The Mississippi Department of Wildlife,\nFisheries, and Parks have been monitoring the situation and controlling Alligator Weed with Alligator\nWeed Flea Beetles obtained from the US Army Corps of Engineers.\n21\n\nWetland Reserve Program (WRP) reforestation on the south end of the Bee Lake Watershed.\nNative Warm Season Grass Buffer planted adjacent to Bee Lake protect against soil erosion \nand enhance bobwhite quail nesting habitat.\n22\n\nC.WILDLIFE RESOURCES\nTerrestrial  wildlife,  migratory  birds,  and  other  wildlife  \n\nthrive  in  the  watershed.    Forestlands  are  man-\naged for timber production, white-tailed deer, and turkey.  Wetlands are managed for waterfowl and\nshorebirds.  Southern reaches of the watershed have been enrolled in the Wetland Reserve Program\nand adjoin the Hillside National Wildlife Refuge.  \nPrivate landowners have also planted native warm season grasses and legumes around field borders\nfor quail and other small game. \nFood plots are maintained within the watershed for migratory ducks, mourning dove, white-tailed deer,\nand eastern wild turkey.  \nAlthough  there  have  been  no  recorded  sightings,  the  watershed  does  fall  within  the  range  of  the\nLouisiana  Black  Bear.    Other  federally  (added  by  PB)  threatened  or  endangered  species  that  may\noccur in the watershed, but are presently not documented, are the Least Tern and Pondberry.  Species\nof special interest that do occur in the watershed include Bald Eagle, American Alligator, Black-bellied\nWhistling Duck, Osprey, Grasshopper Sparrow, Roseate Spoonbill, Wood Stork, and White Ibis.\nPublic duck hunting is allowed on Bee Lake.  However, there is no other public hunting or fee based\nhunting opportunities in the watershed.  Ducks, mourning dove, quail, white-tailed deer, eastern wild\nturkey, and rabbits are commonly hunted on private lands in the watershed by landowners, family, and\ninvited guests.\nTable 6.1.

The designated beneficial uses for Bee Lake are Aquatic Life Support and Secondary\nContact  Recreation  (http://www.deq.state.ms.us/MDEQ.nsf/page/WMB_yazoodesignate?OpenDocument). Table  2,Lists\nthe numeric water quality criteria applicable to Bee Lake watershed surface waters (MDEQ  2002).\nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: “Waters shall be\nfree from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or other discharges producing color,\nodor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, sediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree\nas to create a nuisance, render the waters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and\nwildlife or adversely affect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any desig-\nnated use ” (MDEQ  2002).\nA.  Current Condition\nThere is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Bee Lake watershed. Bee Lake was sampled\nat one station during both the 1994 and 1995 clean lake sampling programs. The water quality data\nfrom these sampling programs can be found in the Bee Lake TMDL (Tetra Tech 2003) and in the Yazoo\nRiver  Basin  water  quality  data  compendium  (MDEQ  2003a).  Bee  Lake  was  included  on  the  1996\n303(d) List as impaired due to nutrients, organic enrichment/low DO, pesticides, and sediment/silta-\ntion. TMDLs addressing these impairments have been completed, and Bee Lake is in the process of\nbeing removed from the 303(d) List (MDEQ  2004a).\nB.  Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)\nBee Lake was included on the 1996 Mississippi 303(d) list as impaired due to nutrients, organic enrich-\nment/low dissolved oxygen, pesticides, and sediment/siltation; Two total maximum daily load studies\n(TMDLs)  related  to  these  listed  segments  have  been  completed,  one  addressing  nutrients,  organic\nenrichment/low dissolved oxygen, and sediment/siltation, and one addressing pesticides.\nA TMDL addressing  nutrients,  organic  enrichment/low  dissolved  oxygen,  and  sediment/siltation  has\nbeen completed and approved by U.S. EPA (Tetra Tech 2003). The TMDL report states that no known\npoint sources related to these pollutants/impairments are present in the watershed. Nonpoint sources\nrelated  to  these  pollutants/impairments  that  were  accounted  for  in  the  development  of  the  TMDL\nincluded  runoff  from  cultivated  and  non-cultivated  agricultural  lands,  catfish  pond  discharges,  and\nbackground sources (forest land). Wet weather conditions were identified as the critical condition for\nthese impairments. Failing septic systems were assumed to contribute a negligible load and so were\nexcluded  from  the  analysis.  Furthermore,  a  noxious  aquatic  weed  (Alligator  Weed)  has  consumed\nmore than 20% of the surface water acres of Bee Lake itself and may be contributing to low DO lev-\n24\n\nels during the fall and winter when cold weather causes the plant material to die off and begin decom-\nposing.  Since Mississippi does not currently have nutrient water quality criteria, a nutrient TMDL was\nnot  developed,  however,  nutrient  contributions  to  oxygen  demand  were  included  in  this  TMDL.  No\nreductions were recommended for oxygen demanding loads to Bee Lake. Sediment load reductions\nof 33%-60% were recommended in the TMDL; these reductions were achieved by reducing sediment\nloads from agricultural lands. TMDLs for oxygen demand and sediment are shown in Table  3(Tetra\nTech 2003).\nTable  6.2.  Bee Lake TMDL\nThe  Bee  Lake  pesticide  impairment  was  addressed  in  a  pesticide  TMDL for  the  Yazoo  River  basin\n(MDEQ  2003b).  The  target  for  this  TMDL is  removal  of  fish  consumption  advisories  for  DDT  and\nToxaphene,  and  reduction  of  water  column  concentrations  to  the  DDT  human  health  and  aquatic\norganism  standard,  and  the  Toxaphene  fresh  water  chronic  standard.  The  methods  proposed  for\nachieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce sediment loading to water bodies\n(pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural attenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from\nthe Yazoo River basin indicate a decreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and\nwater)  (MDEQ  2003b).    However,  fish  advisories  for  Bee  Lake  were  lifted  after  TMDLs  for  Legacy\nPesticides were developed in the Yazoo River Basin (MDEQ 2005).\nVII.    WATERSHED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\nThe initial goal of this WIP is to address the concerns identified by the WIT. This will be achieved by\nthe implementation of projects (listed later in this section) to address short-term concerns and an edu-\ncational strategy to address long-term concerns. By addressing these concerns, Bee Lake will achieve\nits Mississippi water quality criteria and beneficial use designation for Aquatic Life Support while meet-\ning local stakeholder objectives.\nThe underlying principle of this WIP (and the Basin Management Program itself) is adaptive manage-\nment. While the initial goal of this WIP is to address concerns identified by the WIT, post-project mon-\nitoring  may  suggest  that  not  all  concerns  were  fully  addressed.    Likewise,  additional  concerns  may\n25\nTypeTBODu \n(lb/day)\nSediment\n(ton/acre/year)\nWaste Load Allocation\n0\n0.2 – 0.33\nLoad Allocation\n234\n0.2 – 0.33\nMargin of Safety(implicit)(implicit)\nTMDL\n234\n0.2 – 0.33\n\narise that were not originally identified by the WIT.  Therefore, this WIP is a living document and should\nbe  reviewed  and  modified  periodically  to  ensure  adequate  improvements  are  made  and  sustained\nthroughout the life of the watershed.\nThe initial actions taken through the implementation of this WIP should provide measurable results by\nthe end of 2007.  In 2008, the WIP should be updated with the results of the initial actions and modi-\nfied to address any inadequacies and newly identified concerns.\nFollowing  are  detailed  descriptions  of  management  actions  planned  for  the  initial  implementation  of\nthis  WIP.  Note  that  the  values  shown  for  load  reductions,  number  of  management  practices  to  be\ninstalled, and costs are planning estimates and subject to change.\nA.AGRICULTURAL BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES - DESIRED \nBENEFITS\nThe objective of this action is to reduce sediment loadsfrom agricultural land to approximately 1900\nto 3300 tons/year (Tetra Tech 2003). Estimated load reductions associated with this objective are list-\ned below:\n•  Approximately 1800 to 3200 tons/year reduction of sediment load, 35% to 67% reduction of\nload from agricultural lands, 33% to 60% reduction of total sediment load;\n•  Approximately 18 tons/year reduction of total nitrogen load, 70% reduction; and\n•  Approximately 2.3 tons/year reduction of total phosphorus load, 33% reduction; and\n•  Approximately 33% reduction of DDT and Toxaphene loads (Tetra Tech 2003).\nThrough this load reduction, several benefits will arise for farmers, businesses, recreational fishermen,\nand the general public.  The TMDL for sediment will be met.  Water storage capacity and lake depth\nwill be maintained.  Consolidated sediment on the bottom of the lake will be minimized, providing bet-\nter spawning areas for game fish.  Turbidity will be reduced improving DO levels, fisheries productivi-\nty, and aesthetic values. \n1.Participants\n(a).Delta F.A.R.M.\nDelta  F.A.R.M.  (Farmers  Advocating  Resource  Management)  will  enroll  willing  farmers  in  the  water-\nshed into the organization’s self-assessment program to improve overall environmental stewardship.\nThe organization will assist farmers by providing information on voluntary BMP implementation that is\nabove and beyond BMPs identified in this WIP.  A majority of these BMPs directly address non-point\nsource agricultural runoff.\n26\n\n(b).Delta Wildlife\nDelta  Wildlife  will  administer  EPA/MDEQ  319  funds  for  the  implementation  of  projects  critical  to  the\nsuccess of the WIP that cannot be cost-shared through USDA Conservation Programs or other part-\nners.  These projects may include bank stabilization, drainage improvements, water control structures,\ngrass filter strips, riparian buffers, stiff grass hedges, land forming, and other BMPs.  Delta Wildlife will\nwork with the landowners in the watershed to identify critical areas and develop BMP implementation\nplans.  Furthermore, Delta Wildlife will coordinate the implementation and certification of all BMPs in\nthe watershed with private landowners and other partners, no matter the funding source.  \n(c).USDA-NRCS and FSA\nThe USDA offers a suite of cost-shared conservation practices that can be used by private landown-\ners  and  farmers  to  address  almost  all  water  quality,  quantity,  and  wildlife  resource  concerns.    The\nNatural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) provides technical assistance on all USDA conserva-\ntion programs and administers a large majority of programs.  The Farm Service Agency (FSA) admin-\nisters the Conservation Reserve Program.  Delta Wildlife and the NRCS will work with landowners in\nthe  watershed  to  identify  critical  areas  and  determine  USDA program  eligibility.    If  eligibility  require-\nments  are  met  and  funding  is  secure,  the  landowner  will  enroll  in  the  program.    The  Environmental\nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP) will be used for land forming, conservation tillage practice incen-\ntive,  water  control  structures,  bank  stabilization  and  other\nBMPs  to  the  extent  of  program  availability  in  Holmes\nCounty. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) will be used\nfor riparian buffer establishment and grass filter strips.\n(d).Mississippi Partners for Fish \nand Wildlife\nThe Mississippi Partners for Fish and Wildlife is a conglom-\nerate  of  natural  and  wildlife  resource  organizations  and\nagencies headed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that\nprovides cost-sharing on various BMPs in Mississippi.  Most\nnotably,  the  Partnership  can  provide  water  control  struc-\ntures and tree seedling for reforestation or riparian buffers.   \n(e).U.S. Geological Survey\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will provide data from\nthe Mississippi Systems Evaluations Area (MSEA Project).\nThis  data  documents  the  measured  benefits  of  various\nBMPs.    By  using  this  data,  the  WIT can  choose  the  best\nBMP to address a specific concern.  Furthermore, the data\ncan be used to measure the benefits of each BMP installed. \n27\nUSGS  Monitoring  Station  installed  on\nBee Lake in the fall of 2005.\n\nThe USGS will also be installing a permanent water monitoring station on Bee Lake to measure tur-\nbidity, lake level, pH, conductivity, temperature, and other baseline water quality measurements.  The\ndata will be “real time” and downloaded to the USGS server hourly.  The data will be posted on the\nUSGS website.  This will enable the WIT and MDEQ to monitor improvements in turbidity and other\nwater quality measurements during pre and post project implementation.\n(f).MS Dept. of Environmental Quality\nMDEQ shall provide 50% of the cost of the USGS water quality monitoring station through a cooper-\native agreement with the USGS.\n(g).Private Landowners\nAlthough almost every BMP that will be implemented through this plan will be cost-shared, none will\nbe 100% cost-shared.  Therefore, the private landowners and farmers in the watershed will be required\nto provide equipment, labor, fuel, and some money to off set the cost of implementation. \n2.Best Management Practices (BMP) Activities\nTo properly address sedimentation, turbidity, and all ag related non-point source pollution in Bee Lake,\na suite of BMPs must be installed throughout the watershed.  These BMPs may include, but are not\nlimited to:\n•Structures for Water Control (+/- 50 units)\n•Overfall Pipes (+/-20 units)\n•Riparian Buffers (+/-20 acres)\n•Grass Filter Strips (included in riparian buffer estimate)\n•Grass Waterways (+/-15 acres)\n•Stiff Grass Hedges (+/-20 sites)\n•Field Borders (+/-5 acres)\n•Land Forming (+/-500 acres)\n•Bank Stabilization (as needed, +/-15 sites, may include grass waterway estimate)\n•Cover/Double Cropping (+/-500 acres)\n•Drainage Improvement (+/-2 miles)\nDelta Wildlife will work with the landowners and the WIT to survey the watershed and identify areas of\nconcern.    Then,  Delta  Wildlife  will  work  with  the  landowner  to  identify  solutions  to  the  concern  and\ndevelop an implementation plan specific to his/her property.  Funding for the implementation of each\npersonal  implementation  plan  will  vary.    USDA funding  will  be  targeted  first,  followed  by  Mississippi\nPartners for Fish and Wildlife and other sources.  If no funding is available through these sources, \n28\n\nSection 319 funds will be used if the need is critical.  If USDA funding is used, NRCS staff and engi-\nneers will survey, design, and certify BMP installations.  If other sources are used, qualified profession-\nals and/or engineers will be used to survey, design, and certify BMP installations.  Ultimate responsi-\nbility for ensuring installation of these measures rests with MDEQ under MS Code Ann. 49-17-29(a)\n(2).\nRegardless of the funding source, the long-term maintenance of BMPs installed through this WIP will\nbe  the  responsibility  of  the  private  landowners.    USDA funded  projects  will  required  maintenance\nagreements, as will Mississippi Partners for Fish and Wildlife projects.  15-year minimum maintenance\nagreements will also be required on projects funded through Section 319.  Section 319 maintenance\nagreements  will  be  held  and  monitored  by  Delta  Wildlife  through  December  31,  2007  and  then  the\nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality. \n3.Schedule\nThe first process in implementation is the identification of sites for treatment.  This survey process was\ncompleted in March of 2006.  Implementation plans for each landowner will then be developed.  BMPs\nwill be designed and engineered to USDA-NRCS specifications.  Funding for implementation will then\nbe  identified,  and  once  secured,  each  approved  practice  will  be  installed.    Installation  of  BMPs  will\nbegin in 2006 and continue through 2007.  The USGS monitoring station was installed in September,\n2005.    Delta  Wildlife  will  submit  reports  on  the  progress  of  implementation  bi-annually  to  MDEQ\nthrough December 31, 2007.\n4.Budget\nProjected costs, for implementing practices required by this plan are listed in the table below.  Funding\nfor  these  items  include  USDA,  Mississippi  Partners  for  Fish  and  Wildlife,  Section  319,  and  private\nlandowners.\n29\n\nTable 7.1.  Projected Costs for Agricultural BMPs\nB.WEIR RECONSTRUCTION – DESIRED BENEFITS\nThe  objective  of  this  action  is  to  reconstruct  the  existing  weir  in  order  to  maintain  an  adequate  lake\nlevel in Bee Lake when the Yazoo River and Tchula Lake drop below the lake’s outlet elevation. A reli-\nable  weir  is  critical  to  sustain  an  adequate  lake  depth  for  year-round  recreational  fishing  and  water\nstorage capacity for surface water irrigation.  Furthermore, an improved weir will reduce head cutting\nand associated sediment loading in the lake.  The fisheries, water quality, water supply, aesthetics, and\neconomy of the watershed depend on a reliable and functioning weir.  A reliable weir is the single most\nimportant component of this WIP. \nA new weir will ensure Bee Lake’s ability to store at least 7,000 acre/feet of water for recreational fish-\ning and surface water irrigation.  Currently, the lake provides water for 15-20 permitted surface water\nusers and would provide ample water to permit additional users in the future.  Furthermore, the weir\nwould maintain an average depth of 7.1 feet throughout the lake, maximizing fisheries potential.\n1.Participants\n(a).Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Mgt Distric\n\nt\nThe Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District (YMD) is charged with the duty of man-\naging water supply in a majority of the Yazoo Basin, including the Bee Lake Watershed.  YMD permits\nand  monitors  both  ground  and  surface  water  use  in  the  watershed  for  MDEQ.    YMD  promotes  and\nimplements  water  conservation  measures  through  a  number  of  methods,  one  of  which  is  the  Delta\nStudy (Mississippi Delta Comprehensive Multipurpose Water Resource Plan).  Initially, the study was\ndesigned to investigate the feasibility of various water conservation practices.  The initial phase of the\n30\nPracticeUnit Cost \n(w/installation)\nNumber of UnitsTotal Cost\nWater Control Structures$2,500.0050$125,000.00\nOverfall Pipes$5,000.0020$500,000.00\nRiparian Buffers$1,175/acre20/acres$23,500.00\nGrass Waterways$450.00/acre15/acres$6,750.00\nStiff Grass Hedges$250.00/site20/sites$5,000.00\nField Borders$1,165.00/acre5/acres$5,825.00\nLand Forming$400.00/acre500/acres$200,000.00\nBank Stabilization$10,000.00/site15/sites$150,000.00\nCover/Double Cropping$20.00/acre x 15 years500/acres$150,000.00\nDrainage Improvement$10,000.00/mile2/miles$20,000.00\nUSGS Construction/Instrumentation$30,000.001$30,000.00\nUSGS Monitoring $20,000.00/yr.5 yrs$100,000.00\nTOTAL   $1,316,075.00\n\nstudy has been completed.  Today, funding for the Delta Study is being used to implement large-scale\nwater conservation practices that benefit multiple users and the public.  The Delta Study is funded by\nthe USDA-NRCS.  \nYMD has committed to stabilize the Bee Lake weir with Delta Study funding in late 2005 and rebuild\nthe  weir  in  2006.    Funding  has  already  been  secured.    Preliminary  surveys,  elevation  options,  and\ndesign options have also been completed. \n(b).Private Landowners\nAll  preliminary  weir  designs  and  elevations  will  inundate  +/-  15  acres  of  production  cropland.\nInundation will affect at least two different property owners, both of which have agreed to these terms.\nFurthermore,  the  weir  will  be  built  on  private  property  (owned  by  a  third  landowner).    At  least  three\nlandowners  will  be  sacrificing  either  land  and/or  potential  revenue  to  ensure  the  construction  of  the\nnew weir.  \n(c).U.S. Geological Survey\nThe monitoring station installed on Bee Lake will also measure lake level.  Data may be reviewed on\nthe USGS website.  This will help to measure the effectiveness of the weir and determine. \n(d)Natural Resource Conservation Service\nEngineers with the USDA-NRCS will assist in the design of the weir.\n2.Weir Construction Activities\nYMD has already begun preliminary survey and design work.  Furthermore, the existing weir has been\n“patched” until construction can begin.  Design, site selection, and elevation options will be presented\nto  potentially  affected  landowners  and  users.    Once  a  design,  site,  and  elevation  are  agreed  upon,\nconstruction will begin in 2006.  YMD shall conduct all activities associated with weir survey, design,\nand construction.  YMD will monitor the weir and either maintain the weir or establish a maintenance\nagreement with local landowners. \n3.Schedule\nYMD began preliminary survey and design work in 2005.  During the winter of 2005 and 2006, YMD\nand local stakeholders will decide on a design, site, and elevation for the weir.  As soon as conditions\nare suitable, construction will begin in 2006.  Construction should be complete before December 31,\n2006.  Delta Wildlife and/or YMD will submit weir construction status reports to MDEQ when (1) the\nsite, design, and elevation have been approved, (2) when construction begins, and (3) when construc-\ntion is complete.  The USGS monitoring station will be installed by December 31, 2005.\n31\n\n4.Budget\nProjected costs for implementing practices required by this plan are listed in the table below.  Funding\nfor these items include USDA-Delta Study Funds, YMD, NRCS and Private Landowners.\nTable 7.2.  Projected Costs for Weir Construction\nC.       NOXIOUS AQUATIC VEGETATION – DESIRED BENEFITS\nNoxious  aquatic  vegetation  has  created  numerous  problems  in  Bee  Lake.    Alligator  Weed  restricts\naccess and movement on the lake.   Furthermore, there is a isolated coon-tail problem on the upper\nend of the lake that threatens the entire lake if it is spread.  Both poses a safety threat to swimmers\nand skiers. Plant materials cover the surface of the water, blocking sunlight for phytoplankton produc-\ntion.  This ultimately reduces overall fish carrying capacity as lake productivity is then based on a less\nefficient means of energy conversion. A rapid die-off of aquatic vegetation can stress dissolved oxy-\ngen supplies.   By best management of the aquatic vegetation Bee Lake should see an increase in\naccessible  water  acres,  improved  safety,  a  more  diverse  fish  habitat,  and  higher  aesthetic  value.\nVegetation coverage on most areas of the lake is currently at optimum levels for lake use while pro-\nviding a diverse habitat for fish. A few areas have invasive vegetation that needs to be controlled.\n1.Participants\n(a).Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \nMDWFP has been and will continue to monitor aquatic vegetation in Bee Lake.  To date, MDWFP fish-\neries biologist have significantly reduced Alligator Weed in the lake through the stocking of Alligator\nWeed Flea Beetles.  MDWFP will continue to monitor and control noxious aquatic weeds in Bee Lake.\n(b).Delta Wildlife\nDelta Wildlife will work with MDWFP to monitor and control noxious aquatic vegetation\nin Bee Lake.  Delta Wildlife and MDWFP will pursue additional funding sources to more aggressively\naddress noxious aquatic weeds in the lake.  If none can be secured, some Section 319 funds may be\nused for eradication of coon-tail in the upper lake.\n32\nPractice\nUnit Cost \n(w/installation)\nNumber of UnitsTotal Cost\nYMD weir repair$15,000.001$15,000.00\nNRCS Survey & Design$100/hr.20 hrs.$2,000.00\nYMD Construction$200,000.001$200,000.00\nUSGS Monitoring Station$20,000.0/yr5 yrs$100,000.00\nTotal$317,000.00\n\n(c).Recreational Fishermen and other Boaters\nMany noxious aquatic plant materials are transferred by different parts of a boat when they move with-\nin a lake and from one lake to another.  Recreational fishermen, skiers, and other boaters must play\na role in the control of noxious aquatic weeds in Bee Lake.  Through educational outreach activities\n(further  outlined  in  section  4.0),  boaters  will  be  encouraged  to  clean  their  boat  hulls,  live  wells,  and\nlower units before and after they launch their boats in Bee Lake.  \n(d).U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\nThe USACOE has historically provided MDWFP with Alligator Weed Flea Beetles used in the control\nof Alligator Weed.  The USACOE will continue to provide these insects to MDWFP for use in Bee Lake\nand other areas with severe Alligator Weed problems.\n2.Noxious Aquatic Weed Activities\nMDWFP will continue their on-going efforts to monitor aquatic weed and control Alligator Weed in Bee\nLake.  Delta Wildlife and MDWFP staff will work together to identify other noxious aquatic weeds in\nBee Lake and develop a control or eradication plan.  Funding for such plans will be pursued through\nextramural grants.  If no grants are secured, Section 319 funding may be used if the need is deter-\nmined critical.  Educational outreach components needed for noxious aquatic weed control will also be\ndeveloped by MDWFP in conjunction with Delta Wildlife.\n3.Schedule\nMDWFP has been and shall continue to monitor aquatic weed problems in Bee Lake.  Furthermore,\nthey will continue to control Alligator Weed with Alligator Weed Flea Beetles until which time Alligator\nWeed  is  at  perceived  optimal  levels.  In  2006,  MDWFP and  Delta  Wildlife  will  identify  other  noxious\naquatic weeds in Bee Lake and develop a control and/or eradication plan.  MDWFP and Delta Wildlife\nwill also submit grant proposals for the plan in 2006.  If funding is secured through extramural grants,\nimplementation will begin in 2007.  If funding is not secured, MDWFP, Delta Wildlife, and MDEQ will\ndetermine the feasibility of using Section 319 funds to implement parts or all of the proposed control\nand/or eradication plan in 2007.  Educational outreach components needed for noxious aquatic weed\ncontrol  will  be  developed  and  implemented  in  2006.    Delta  Wildlife  will  submit  bi-annual  reports  to\nMDEQ on the status of noxious aquatic weed control in Bee Lake.\n4.Budget\nProjected costs for implementing practices required by this plan are listed in the table below.  Funding\nfor these items include MDWFP, USACOE, Delta Wildlife, and a potential extramural grant source.\n33\n\nTable 7.3.  Projected Costs for Noxious Aquatic Weed Control\nD.         ORGANIC ENRICHMENT – DESIRED BENEFITS\nImpairments  listed  in  the1996  Mississippi  303(d)  list  for  Bee  Lake  included  nutrients  and  organic\nenrichment.    It  is  possible  that  phosphorus,  nitrogen,  and  failing  septic  systems  are  contributing  to\norganic enrichment in Bee Lake.  Despite this concern, the WIT does not believe that there is enough\ndata to support listed impairments for nutrients and organic enrichment in Bee Lake.  Therefore, the\nWIT shall advise MDEQ that further monitoring and assessment should be conducted to determine if\nin fact there is a problem.  If a problem is clearly identified, the WIT will then develop a plan of action\nto address the issues in an amended and updated version of this WIP. \n1.Participants\n(a).MS Dept. of Environmental Quality\nMDEQ may provide monitoring and assessment to determine the extent and severity of organic enrich-\nment, nutrient loading, and other associated water quality measurements.\n(b).MS Dept. of Health\nMDH may provide monitoring and assessment to determine the extent and severity of organic enrich-\nment, nutrient loading, and other associated water quality measurements.  Furthermore, if failing sep-\ntic  systems  are  identified  as  a  concern,  they  will  assist  in  developing  an  action  plan  to  address  the\nissue.\n(c).U.S. Geological Survey\nUSGS may provide monitoring and assessment to determine the extent and severity of organic enrich-\nment, nutrient loading, and other associated water quality measurements\n34\nPractice\nUnit Cost \n(w/installation)\nNumber of UnitsTotal Cost\nMDWFP Monitoring$300 day/yr.3 days/yr./3years$ 2,700.00\nDelta Wildlife Assistance$100.00/hr.80 hrs.$8,000.00\nAlligator Weed Flea Beetles$0.00/500 insects10/yr.$0.00\nStocking Flea Beetles$300/day/yr.1 day/yr./3years$900\nOther Control/Eradication\n(Other Possible Sources)\n$20,000.001$20,000.00\nTotal$20,700.00$31,600.00\n\n(d).MS Dept. of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks\nMDWFP may  provide  monitoring  and  assessment  to  determine  the  extent  and  severity  of  organic\nenrichment, nutrient loading, and other associated water quality measurements\n(e).YMD Joint Water Management District \nYMD may provide monitoring and assessment to determine the extent and severity of organic enrich-\nment, nutrient loading, and other associated water quality measurements\n2.Organic Enrichment Activities\nThe WIT shall submit a request to MDEQ asking for assistance in monitoring and assessing organic\nenrichment and nutrient loading in Bee Lake.  MDEQ will then develop a monitoring program and pos-\nsible ask for assistance from other agencies (listed above).  If monitoring activities indicate a need to\naddress organic enrichment and nutrient loading, the WIT will re-convene to develop a plan of action.\nThis plan will be added to the WIP.\n3.Schedule\nThe WIT shall make this request upon submission of the initial WIP to MDEQ in the spring of 2006.\nMonitoring schedules shall be determined by MDEQ or other agencies involved in the monitoring and\nassessment phase.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT – DESIRED BENEFITS\nWith  Bee  Lake’s  aesthetic  values,  popularity  among  fishermen,  and  its  proximity  to  Yazoo  City  and\nJackson,  future  development  of  lake  front  properties  could  pose  a  threat  to  the  lake’s  water  quality,\nnatural beauty, and property values.  By establishing covenants or building codes around Bee Lake,\nwater quality, natural beauty, and property values can be preserved or improved.\n35\nPractice\nUnit Cost \n(w/installation)\nNumber of UnitsTotal Cost\nMonitoring$30,000.00/yr2 yrs.$60,000.00\nAssessment$5,000.001 time$5,000.00\nTotal  $65,000.00\n\n1.Participants\nPrivate Land and Business Owners\nIt  will  be  the  initiative  of  the  private  land  and  business  owners  to  develop  an  association,  develop\ncovenants, or to work with Holmes County officials to develop building codes for Bee Lake.  The WIT\nwill assist if requested.\n2.Future Development Activities\nThe  private  land  and  business  owners  of  Bee  Lake  will  determine  the  activities  associated  with  this\nWIP action item.  The WIT will assist if requested and keep abreast of all activities and actions.\n3.Schedule\nThe WIT shall submit a letter to the land and business owners on Bee Lake respectfully requesting\ntheir consideration in developing covenants or building codes for future development.  This letter will\nbe  mailed  after  the  final  submission  of  this  WIP to  MDEQ  in  the  spring  of  2006.    Delta  Wildlife  will\nupdate  MDEQ  on  any  actions  taken  by  the  land  and  business  owners  through  standard  bi-annual\nreports.\n4.Budget\nProjected costs for implementing this WIP action items will be negligible and assumed by the land\nand business owners on Bee Lake.\nF.FISHERIES MANAGEMENT – DESIRED BENEFITS\nFishing pressure, water quality, and many other factors limit the fisheries potential and overall fish pro-\nductivity at Bee Lake. The stocks of sunfish and bass in Bee Lake are believed to be well below lev-\nels that were present in the 1950’s and 1960’s (MDWFP, Bee Lake Fishery Management Plan, 2005).\nMany of the factors limiting fish production will be addressed through other action items that reduce\nsedimentation, reduce turbidity, sustain lake levels, reduce noxious aquatic weeds, and improve water\nquality  in  general.    However,  intensive  fisheries  management  is  needed  on  Bee  Lake  to  address\nintense fishing pressure and fish harvest.  Through management, creel limits, slot restrictions, habitat\nmodification, water quality improvements and other means, the fishery at Bee Lake can be improved\nto sustain current and future fishery demands, with a possible restoration of the sunfish and bass fish-\neries.\n1.Participants\n(a).MS Dept. of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks\nMDWFP acts  to  manage  the  public  fisheries  of  Mississippi,  including  Bee  Lake.    MDWFP Fisheries\nBiologists will continue to monitor, assess, and manage the fishery at Bee Lake.\n(b).Delta Wildlife\n36\n\nDelta Wildlife will provide assistance to MDWFP to manage the fishery at Bee Lake as needed.\nFurthermore, Delta Wildlife’s Adopt-a-Lake Program may be used to add additional deep water fish-\ning structures for fishermen at Bee Lake.\n(c).Recreational Fishermen\nRecreational  fishermen  must  recognize  all  regulations  and  management  activities  implemented  on\nBee Lake.  Full cooperation with MDWFP will be needed to properly manage the fishery.  Additionally,\nthe Adopt-a-Lake Program administered by Delta Wildlife will require the assistance of fishermen and\nresidence of the lake to be implemented.\n2.Fisheries Management Activities\nMDWFP monitors fish species diversity, populations, age structure, sizes, and harvest at Bee Lake.\nThese activities will continue.  Furthermore, MDWFP actions are guided by a Fisheries Management\nPlan for Bee Lake that was implemented in 2005.  Through monitoring activities, creel limits, slot lim-\nits, and other regulations may be placed on the harvest of fish in the lake.  MDWFP is also develop-\ning a new map for the lake with depth profile and user features.  Delta Wildlife also encourages fish-\nermen  to  participate  in  the  Adopt-a-Lake  Program  whereas  structures  will  be  placed  in  deep  water\nareas of the lake for summer and early fall fishing.\n3.Schedule\nMDWFP implemented the Bee Lake Fisheries Management Plan in the spring of 2006.  The new lake\nmap  will  be  available  in  2007.    If  interest  exists,  the  Adopt-a-Lake  Program  will  be  implemented  in\n2006.  Delta Wildlife will submit a report of actions to MDEQ bi-annually.\n4.Budget\nProjected costs for fisheries management are listed in the table below.  Funding for these items include\nMDWFP, Delta Wildlife, and recreational fishermen.\n37\n\nTable 7.5.  Projected Costs for Fisheries Management\nG.  LAKE ACCESS – DESIRED BENEFITS \nDuring peak fishing periods at Bee Lake (February, March, and April), there are not enough boat ramps\nto service the needs of the public.  There are only two public boat ramps (both fee based) on the 1,400-\nacre lake.  For those that do launch their boats during the peak fishing season, many must park their\nvehicles and trailers on the shoulder of US Highway 49E, creating safety issues for motorists.  At least\none additional public boat ramp with adequate parking is needed to service the public during peak fish-\ning periods.  A public fishing pier would also be beneficial.  \n1.Participants\n(a).MS Dept. of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks\nMDWFP, through the Sports Fish Restoration Program, provides funding for the construction of boat\nramps  and  fishing  piers  on  public  waters.    MDWFP maintains  a  full,  year-round,  crew  building  boat\nramps around the state.  If a site is identified, MDWFP will provid\n\ne assistance in the construction of a\nboat ramp and/or pier at Bee Lake.\n(b).Delta Wildlife\nDelta Wildlife will work with MDWFP to identify potential sites for a future boat ramp and/or pier.  Delta\nWildlife will also work with the landowner to arrange an easement for MDWFP or compensation for the\nland if needed.\n38\nPracticeUnit Cost (w/installation)Number of UnitsTotal Cost\nMonitoring:           - field \nFish Population-\nReports\n$590 day\n$266 day\n4\n2\n$2,892\nMonitoring:  2007   - field\nHarvest Survey\n-Reports\n$288 day\n$266 day\n28\n10\n$10,730\nMgt.

If a site is identi-\nfied, Delta Wildlife and MDWFP will work with the landowner to secure an easement for construction.\nMDWFP will then survey, design, and construct the boat ramp.\n3.Schedule\nSite identification will begin in the spring of 2006.  Construction will be completed within 6 months of\nsite identification.  Delta Wildlife and/or MDWFP shall submit a status report of progress bi-annually\nto MDEQ.\n4.Budget\nProjected costs for boat ramp construction are listed in the table below.

The pur-\npose of the first plan is to document baseline water quality parameters before, during, and after the\nimplementation of the WIP.  Information will be used to document the baseline water quality benefits\naccrued by the Bee Lake WIP.  Parameters will include lake depth (water level at gage elevation), pre-\ncipitation, temperature, conductivity, and turbidity.  These parameters will be taken continuously (real-\ntime) for at least a 3-year period and recorded by the U.S. Geological Survey.  Data may be obtained\nby logging on to the USGS website at: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ms/nwis/uv?dd_cd=01\n%2C02%2C03%2C04%2C06%2C07&format=gif&period=7&site_no=072873355.    Data  collection\nbegan on September 7, 2005 from a permanent station installed on the Bee Lake bridge just off U.S.\nHighway  49E  near  Thornton,  MS.    The  monitoring  plan  will  cost  approximately  $30,000.00  per  year\nand will be split between the USGS and MS Dept. of Environmental Quality.  \nThe second water quality monitoring plan will be designed to evaluate and assess organic enrichment\nand nutrient loading in Bee Lake.  At this point in time, there is not sufficient data to support an action\nplan to address organic enrichment and nutrients.  It is not even known if organic enrichment and nutri-\nent  loading  is  a  problem  at  the  lake  despite  its  303(d)  listing.    The  Mississippi  Department  of\nEnvironmental Quality will develop and implement an organic enrichment and nutrient monitoring pro-\ngram to evaluate and assess the situation.  If organic enrichment and/or nutrients are identified as a\nserious concern at Bee Lake, the WIT and MDEQ will re-convene to develop an action plan to address\nthe situation.\nOther, non-water quality associated components of the WIP will also be monitored.  MDWFP will mon-\nitor the success of noxious weed control, fisheries management, and the installation of additional boat\nramp(s).  Future development will be monitored by the land and business owners in the watershed.\nB.Assessment of Progress \nDuring 2008, the assessment year of the Basin Group II Basin Management Cycle, progress towards\nthe  goals  of  this  watershed  implementation  plan  will  be  assessed  by  the  WIT  and  MDEQ.    Delta\nWildlife will track and document the implementation of all WIP components.   Water quality data from\nthe USGS monitoring station, as well as information on activities occurring in the watershed and stake-\nholder concerns collected during the period from 2005 through 2008 will be utilized. Assessment will\nbe science-based to the extent possible.  Reductions in sediment loading will be assessed by review-\ning  turbidity  and  conductivity  data  from  the  USGS  water  quality  monitoring  station  before  and  after\nimplementation of the WIP.  At least a 33% reduction is expected.  The stability of the lake level after\nweir construction will be assessed by using the USGS gage depth data.  MDWFP will map noxious\naquatic  weeds  before  and  after  the  project  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  weed  control  measures.\n52\n\nMDWFP will also assess the fisheries management plan base upon fish sampling procedures, creel\nsurveys,  and  other  procedures.    MDEQ  will  assess  the  need  for  further  action  to  address  organic\nenrichment and nutrients based on monitoring data.  Boat ramp assessments will be simply based on\nthe fact that one or more boat ramps have been constructed on the lake.  Future development will be\nassessed to the extent possible, but will more than likely require a longer time line. \nC.Evaluation of the WIP\nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2009, the next Management\nPlanning year of the Basin Group II Basin Management Cycle. The evaluation of this plan will be\norganized by the Bee Lake Watershed Implementation Team, beginning in January 2009. At this\ntime the Implementation Team will develop a detailed schedule for review and revision of this water-\nshed implementation plan. The Implementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their\nstakeholders of the opportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One\nmonth will be allowed for notification of stakeholders.\nThe plan will be evaluated by the WIT.  One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of com-\nments.  Therefore,  comments  will  be  due  two  months  after  the  evaluation  procedure  is  initiated.\nEvaluation may take place every 5 years if necessary.\nEvaluation of the plan will occur in two ways.  The first way will be a science-based assessment (to\nthe extent possible) of whether the plan goals are being achieved. The second way will determine if\nthe plan reflects the targeted goals subsequent to plan completion. The actions taken by the initial WIP\nshould change the condition of the watershed, requiring modifications to the watershed’s description.  \nD.Plan Revision Procedure\nAfter evaluation, WIT and MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan incorporating\nthe changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to call a meeting to recon-\ncile any conflicting comments or requests for change. \nIf  the  evaluation  criteria  are  all  being  met  in  Bee  Lake,  the  watershed  implementation  plan  will  be\nrevised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to protect the water quality of the lake. If\nthe evaluation criteria are not being met, the approach for restoring Bee Lake watershed quality will\nbe revised based on knowledge that has been gained since 2004. The draft of the revised watershed\nimplementation plan will be completed in April; one month after the evaluation has been completed. \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, and all others\nwho submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft watershed implementation plan, the\nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the availability of the revised watershed imple-\n53\n\nmentation plan for stakeholder review. One month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments\nwill be due at the end of this review period.\nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are received, MDEQ\nwill  prepare  a  final  watershed  implementation  plan.  The  final  watershed  implementation  plan  will  be\nsubmitted to the Implementation Team for review and approval. After the final watershed implementa-\ntion plan has been approved, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion\nand availability of the final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities.\nRevisions to the plan may take place every 5 years if needed.\nE.

That\nwas more than 30 years ago.  Since that time, local farmers and residences have taken an active role\nin preserving the lake, whether it be for irrigation, aesthetics, or the fishery.\nIn more recent years, the fishery had become so popular that the lake began to be monitored much\nmore closely by fisheries biologist from the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Park.  It\nwas soon learned that loose sediment on the bottom of the lake was limiting fisheries production.  This\nwas attributed to non-point source runoff from adjacent cropland.  Furthermore, invasive exotic aquat-\nic weeds were also found in the lake.  In the mean time, the EPA lowered its allowable DDT levels in\nfish, causing MDEQ to post new DDT fish advisories around the lake.  This coupled with a new 303(d)\nlist of impaired streams and rumors about a potential new regulatory process called \"TMDL's\" created\na new found concern by local farmers and residence.  \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. was made aware of this renewed concern for the lake in 2000 as fishermen began\ncalling  about  the  Alligator  Weed  and  declining  fishery.  The  Yazoo-Mississippi  Delta  Joint  Water\nManagement  District  (YMD)  was  also  contacted  during  the  same  period  by  farmers  who  were  con-\ncerned about the old weir that had begun to leak.  The next year, Delta Wildlife, Inc. secured a 319\nGrant from MDEQ to put buffers in place around the lake to reduce erosion.  Furthermore, YMD bud-\ngeted to repair or rebuild the Bee Lake Weir in 2006.\nDelta Wildlife installed over 7 miles of buffers around the lake in 2002 while YMD addressed the fail-\ning weir by patching it until funding was secured for a complete reconstruction.  During this process,\nboth YMD and Delta Wildlife, Inc. gained the trust and friendships of the landowners, farmers, and res-\nidences in the watershed.\nWhen Bee Lake was placed on the priority list for a Watershed Restoration Plan in 2004, Delta Wildlife,\nInc. stepped forward to fully develop and implement a plan.  Through a process of inclusive planning\nfrom both technical and local stakeholders, the plan is presented in this document and the first phase\nwill  be  implemented  in  the  next  two  years.    Delta  Wildlife,  Inc.  continues  to  play  a  major  role  in  the\nwater quality components of this project while YMD has focused on the water quantity components.\nHowever, it is the willing participation by local farmers and residence that will make the development\nand implementation of this plan successful.  \n57\n\nAPPENDIX C: Checklist of Watershed Implementation Plan Elements\n58\nRequired Watershed ElementsLocated Reference\n1a. Non-Point Source Agricultural Runoff.  The primary concern is sediment and\nmust be control throughout the watershed.  Critical areas have been identified\nand will be addressed first followed by secondary and less critical areas, total-\ning approximately 14,000 acres of cropland.  319 funds, USDA programs, and\nother sources will be used to address these sites with structural and vegetative\nmeasures.\n1b. Lake Level/Weir.  The weir shall be replaced to protect water level in the\nlake for irrigation use, recreation, and fisheries.  This will be done using USDA\nfunding.\n1c. Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Alligator Weed and Coon-tail threatens both\nrecreational access and water quality through organic enrichment and DO\ndemand during the fall and winter.  Alligator Weed will be treated by a biological\nmeans and funded by the USACE and MDWFP.  Coon-tail will be treated with\nherbicides.\n1d. Organic Enrichment.  Bee Lake is listed for Organic Enrichment although all\nthe causes are not known.  MDEQ will continue to monitor Organic Enrichment\nand attempt to identify all causes before any action is taken.\n1e. Future Development.  Landowners around the lake are concerned with\nfuture development.  However, not water quality components were identified\nand therefore this concern will not be addressed through implementation.\n1f. Fisheries Management.  Heavy fishing pressure can threaten the lake.\nMDWFP will continue to monitor the fishery and place more strict creel and/or\nslot limits on the lake as needed.\n1g. Lake Access.  Fishermen want additional access to the lake.  However, pri-\nvate landowners around the lake are unwilling to provide land for additional\nboat ramps.  Solutions to boat ramp crowding will be discussed with the owners\nof the current boat ramps.\nTable 4.1\n1a. 33% to 60% reduction of total sediment load;\n1b. 70% reduction of total nitrogen load\n1c. 33% reduction of total phosphorus load\n1d. 33% reduction of DDT and Toxaphene loads \nChapter VII, Section A\n(Tetra Tech 2003)\n•Structures for Water Control (+/- 50 units)\n•Overfall Pipes (+/-20 units)\n•Riparian Buffers (+/-20 acres)\n•Grass Filter Strips (included in riparian buffer estimate)\n•Grass Waterways (+/-15 acres)\n•Stiff Grass Hedges (+/-20 sites)\n•Field Borders (+/-5 acres)\n•Land Forming (+/-500 acres)\n•Bank Stabilization (as needed, +/-15 sites, may include \ngrass waterway estimate)\n•Cover/Double Cropping (+/-500 acres)\n•Drainage Improvement (+/-2 miles)\nChapter VII, Section A,\nSubsection 2\n\nAPPENDIX C continued\n59\nRequired Watershed ElementsLocated Reference \nAg BMP $1,276,075.00\nWeir $307,000.00\nNoxious Aquatics $31,600.00\nOrganic Enrichment $65,000.00\nFuture Development $0.00\nFisheries $35,980.00\nLake Access $40,500.00\nTOTAL $1,756,155.00\nTable 8.1\nThe overall objective of community education in the Bee Lake watershed is to\ndevelop an atmosphere that\n\n promotes sustained, long-term protection and\nimprovement of aquatic resources in the watershed.
