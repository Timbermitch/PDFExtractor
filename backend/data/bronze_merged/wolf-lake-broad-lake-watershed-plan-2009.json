The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Wolf \nLake WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Mississippi State \nUniversity, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, USDA Natural \nResources Conservation Service, Mississippi Soil & Water Conservation Commission, \nThe Nature Conservancy, Mississippi State Department of Health, Yazoo-Mississippi \nDelta Joint Water Management District, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nWolf Lake Watershed Description \n \nWolf Lake drains approximately 27,113 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nYazoo and Humphreys counties in west central Mississippi (MDEQ 2003a). We estimate \nthat approximately 600 people lived in this watershed in 2000 (based on Census 2000 \ndata for Yazoo and Humphrey’s County). Although minutes from Yazoo City, only two \ncommunities, Carter and Lake City, are found in the watershed. In 1993 land use in the \nwatershed was primarily agricultural (72%)  (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the \nwatershed include corn, soybeans, cotton, milo, catfish, and rice.  Unless otherwise \nspecified, when Wolf Lake is mentioned it will be assumed that Broad Lake is also \nincluded in the description or statement. \n \n\n 8 \n \nFigure 1.  Wolf Lake Watershed (Location within the State) \n  \n \nFigure 2.  Wolf Lake Watershed \n \n\n 9 \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with some ridge and swell topography provided by river \nterraces (MDEQ 2000). Dundee-Dubbs-Sharkey soils are prevalent throughout the \nwatershed with Alligator-Sharkey-Forestdale comprising the remaining areas.  The \nwatershed is located in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the \nwatershed is bottomland hardwood forest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, \nand cypress (MARIS).  \n \nWolf Lake was formed by the Yazoo River in the most recent meander belt of the \nMississippi River indicating the waterway is  less than 3,000 years old (FTN 1991).  \nBefore Yazoo River levee construction, the watershed drained through Panther Creek and \ninto the Yazoo River.  Currently the watershed has one central outlet at the confluence of \nWolf Lake and Broad Lake which drains (through two channels) into the landside ditch \nof the Wittington Canal.  This landside ditch flows south into Lake George and ultimately \nthe Yazoo River.  This connection leaves the watershed un-protected from high water \nevents on the Mississippi River.  Lake levels typically fluctuate around 88’ (NGVD), \nhowever floodwaters from the Mississippi River can push the lake level much higher \nflooding farmland and residences in the watershed. \n \n       \nFigure 3. Corn field flooded from Mississippi River backwater. \n \n\n 10 \n \nFigure 4. High waters at the confluence of Wolf Lake and Broad Lake. \n \nSurface water levels in the watershed are maintained by rainwater, the Mississippi River \nalluvial aquifer, and the Yazoo River.  Ground water withdrawals for agricultural use, \nprimarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer and surface water, with a majority \ncoming from the alluvial aquifer. However, the aquifer is readily recharged from the \nadjacent bluff hills and Yazoo River (FTN 1991).   \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nMembers of the Wolf Lake Watershed Implementation Team are listed below.  They \nrepresent various professional resource agencies and stakeholders within the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Ron Garavelli, Garry Lucas, Dennis Reicke \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Tim Manor, Chad Fieber, Bobby McCain \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Bo Sloan, Lloyd Inmon \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n\n 11 \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle \nFTN Associates  \n− Randy Reed \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Robert Simrall  \nLandowners/Stakeholders \n− De Paul, Denny Paul, Rob Coker, Sonny Baskin, John Hines, Bob Cato, Bill \nBrown, Kevin Erickson, Bernie Jordan, Ed Jordan, Howard Brent, Harry \nSimmons, Byron Seward \nHomeowners \n− Steven Sanford, Ed Jordan, John Book, John Fouche, Linda Coker, Robert E. \nCoker, Joyce Singleton, Henry Tirey, W.E. Sanford Jr., Edward Gregory, Jimmy \nDixon, Eulow Porter, Billy Vandevere, Lonnie Kight, Chuck Thomas, Susie \nPepper, Ken Roberson, James Irwin Jr., Huey Townsend, Howard Brent, Hy \nEdwards, Tim Edwards, Sandra Harrell, Spincer Harrell, Billy Melton, Lamar \nDorman, Skip Martin, Dale Martin, Dwight Curtis, Debbie Curtis \n \n \n \n \nInterests and Concerns \n \nIt is recognized that production agriculture is the primary source of economic stability in \nthe Wolf Lake Watershed.  Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were the WIT’s primary concern, followed by other water \nquality issues such as legacy pesticides, low dissolved oxygen, organic enrichment, and \nnutrients.  Additional concerns include fecal coliform, threatened and endangered \nspecies, lake depth, fisheries, housing development, garbage dumping, and lake access.+ \n \nOver the course of three WIT meetings that involved natural resource agencies, farmers, \nlandowners, and homeowners, a consensus was easily reached naming sedimentation as \nthe primary concern in the Wolf Lake watershed.  Head cutting, sheet erosion, ditch \nscouring, and gully formation on agricultural lands were all recognized as major \ncontributors to sediment loading in the watershed.  Wave action and subsequent bank \nerosion due to heavy boat traffic was also noted as a contributor of sediment.  Other \nwater quality parameters such as low dissolved oxygen, organic enrichment, nutrients, \nand legacy pesticides were also listed as concerns.  However, it was recognized that \nreduced sediment loading would also address these other concerns to a certain extent. \n \n\n 12 \nWolf Lake has traditionally been an excellent fishery, both for bass and crappie.  Much \nconcern has been expressed for the sustainability and management of this productive \nfishery.  The invasion of silver carp during periods of high water and hydraulic \nconnectivity to the Yazoo River was also mentioned as a concern. \n \nDue to its close proximity to both Yazoo City and Jackson, Wolf Lake is rapidly \nbecoming a popular location for both year-round residences and weekend lake houses.  \nThis increased demand has driven up local property values and concern that future \nconstruction is done in a sustainable manner with minimal impacts to the natural resource \nbase.  Another concern associated with existing and future lakeside development is the \namount of fecal coliform entering the lake through failing or deficient septic systems. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial uses for these waters are Aquatic Life Support (MDEQ 2003a).  Table 2 lists \nthe numeric water quality criteria applicable to Wolf Lake watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Wolf Lake watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L d\n\naily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2002). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nThere is not a routine water quality monitoring station in the Wolf Lake watershed. One \nmajor water quality study was conducted by FTN Associates in 1991. Data from this \nstudy indicates that: \n• Broad Lake was more turbid than Wolf Lake \n• Algae populations were low in the spring and summer due to turbid conditions \n• Whole fish analyses found DDT to be persistent in Wolf Lake \n• It was recommended that bottom sediments not be disturbed due to the potential \nfor mercury and PCB contamination  \n• Wolf Lake had a tendency to be more nutrient rich than other Delta Lakes \n\n 14 \n• The majority of nitrogen, phosphorous, and sediments loads were associated with \nagricultural activities \n \nAlthough the FTN study is the most recent, other studies on pesticides, water quality, and \nfisheries have been completed.  Summaries of these studies can be found in the 1991 \nFTN report on pages a.10-1 – a10.4. \n \nThe Wolf Lake watershed has been evaluated as impaired (not based on water quality \nmeasurements) and is included on the Mississippi 303 (d) List (MDEQ 2004a). Table 3 \nsummarizes the listings from the 2002 303(d) List.  \n \nTable 3. 2002 303(d) Listings for Wolf Lake watershed \nWater Body Beneficial Use Impairment \nWolf Lake Aquatic Life Support Sediment/Siltation and \nNutrients \nWolf Lake Drainage Area Aquatic Life Support Sediment/siltation, Organic \nEnrichment/Low DO, and \nNutrients \n \n \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nWolf Lake has been included and listed as impaired on Mississippi’s 303(d) List.  One \ntotal maximum daily load study (TMDLs) has been completed for sediment/siltation, \norganic enrichment/low dissolved oxygen (MDEQ 2003a).  Although nutrients are listed \nas an impairment, no TMDL has been developed. \n \nNonpoint sources of sediment (due to erosion) are the primary sources of concern. \nSources identified in the TMDL include agriculture, aquaculture, and the natural \nlandscape of which ridge and swell topography is common. Wet weather conditions are  \ncritical for sediment loading to the water bodies. The target measure of sediment \nretention would reduce sediment yields to a range of 0.23 to 0.15 tons per acre per year.  \nMeeting this goal requires a reduction in sedimentation rates on cultivated agricultural \nlands between 31 and 57 percent from current conditions (MDEQ 2003a). \n \nThe TMDL also addresses organic enrichment and low dissolved oxygen listings for \nWolf Lake (MDEQ 2003a). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters, so a TMDL for nutrients was not developed. \n\n 15 \nHowever, nutrient contributions to oxygen demand were included in the dissolved \noxygen TMDL. Nonpoint organic sources are considered to be the primary source of \noxygen demand in the Wolf Lake system. Given this, the TMDL calls for a 48% \nreduction in the total ultimate biochemical oxygen demand (TBODu) to reach the target \nDO value of 5.0 mg/L (MDEQ 2003a).  \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally threatened species that may occur in the watershed is the Louisiana \nblack bear (Ursus americanus luteolus). Although not federally listed, the State of \nMississippi has listed the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Pyramid Pigtoe \n(Pleurobema rubrum), and the Southern Redbelly Dace (Phoxinus erythrogaster) as \nendangered and these species have the potential to be present in the Wolf Lake \nwatershed.  \n \nAll water bodies in the Delta, including those in the Wolf Lake watershed, were placed \nunder fish consumption advisory in 2001 for the legacy pesticides DDT and Toxaphene. \nThe fish covered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over \n22 inches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nSince 1985, bottomland wetland and forest habitats have been restored in the watershed \nthrough USDA Farm Bill Programs such as CRP and WRP.  It is estimated that \napproximately 10% of the watershed has been restored to bottomland hardwood forests in \nthe past 10 years using these federal cost-share programs. Because of increased forest \nlands and a moderate amount of natural wetlands, the Wolf Lake Watershed has fair \npopulations of numerous consumptive wildlife species such as white-tailed deer, \nmigratory waterfowl, and small game.  The eastern wild turkey is also making a humble \nliving in parts of the watershed.   \n \nFishing far surpasses hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed.  Wolf \nLake is well known for being an excellent crappie and bass fishery.    Bluegill can’t be \ndiscounted either, a full moon during the hot summer months usually results in many \nfisherman pursuing this species rather than bass or crappie.  Overall, the fishery appears \nto be in good health.  However there is much concern over the sustainability of this \nfishery as its popularity grows. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 16 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n \nGoal \n \nThe primary goal of this watershed implementation plan is to achieve or exceed water \nquality parameters set forth by the TMDL, thereby removing the potential for regulatory \nactions to be carried out in this watershed.  This can only be accomplished through the \nreduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Wolf Lake must reach and \nmaintain the MDEQ designated use for Aquatic Life Support. The goals of this watershed \nplan can be achieved through the implementation of agricultural BMPs.  Priority \nConcerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed impairments or TMDLs in \nthe watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan because it is comprehensive \nin nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are secondary objectives.  Most \nimportantly, these objectives can’t be achieved without the support of local landowners \nand farmers. \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) \nUSDA-ARS National Soil Sedimentation Laboratory (Sedimentation Lab) \nUSDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) \nU.S. Geological Survey (USGS) \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District (YMD) \nThe Nature Conservancy (TNC) \nFTN Associates  \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) \nLandowners/Stakeholders \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and shorten the \noverall life span of Wolf Lake come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Wolf \nLake.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \n\n 17 \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Wolf Lake can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.  Funding has \nalso been authorized by Section 319 of the Clean Water Act to address non-point source \npollutants, such as sediment, in the Wolf Lake watershed.  These funds are routed \nthrough MDEQ and made available to directly address water quality impairments. \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Wolf Lake Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., Sedimentation Laboratory, Mississippi State University \nExtension Service, USACE, and MDEQ.  \n \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Wolf Lake Watershed. \n \n• Water Control Structures ( 200 units minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (20 sites minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (20 sites minimum) \n• Wetland Construction and Hydrology Restoration (50 acres) \n• Bank Stabilization (20 sites minimum) \n• Riparian Buffers and Grass Filter Strips (100 acres minimum) \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for implementing practices that address sedimentation and siltation can be \nfound in Table 4. \n \nTable 4.

Similar to sediment, organic enrichment and nutrients can be significantly \nreduced by using those same BMPs listed in Table 4.  By implementing these BMPs, \nnutrients can be reduced by approximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and \nJohnson 2000).  It is expected that organic enrichment and DO will react similarly. \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for implementing agricultural BMPs that reduce these pollutants are listed \nin Table 4.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 19 \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) \nUSDA-ARS National Soil Sedimentation Laboratory (Sedimentation Lab) \nUSDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) \nU.S. Geological Survey (USGS) \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District (YMD) \nThe Nature Conservancy (TNC) \nFTN Associates  \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) \nLandowners/Stakeholders \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The EPA sets tolerance levels for said fish advisories \nand MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also assists \nMDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to remove fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003b).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 4 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for implementing BMPs that would reduce the loading of legacy \npesticides are listed in Table 4.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 20 \n \nFisheries Management \n \nParticipants \n      \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n \nImplementation/Action \n   \nMDWFP Bureau of Fisheries and Mississippi State University will take an active role in \nensuring the sustainability of the Wolf Lake fishery and documenting any response by the \nfish community to agricultural BMP’s.  MDWFP has proposed to map the lake’s depth \nprofile as a part of a comprehensive, statewide effort to provide new lake maps to the \npublic.  This project is ongoing.  Furthermore, it is proposed that a fisheries management \nplan be developed, implemented and its subsequent results monitored.  Management \nactions may include the implementation of specific creel and slot sizes on certain species \nof game fish like white crappie and black bass.  Fish community monitoring will be \ncarried out by MSU Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the Mississippi \nDepartment of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. Mississippi State University will provide \nstudents/technicians to work with MDWFP personnel, using MDWFP provided \nelectrofishing/sampling equipment. Working in conjunction with the water quality \nmonitoring sampling sites will be selected that are more and less impacted and sites that \nlikely will experience water quality improvements as a result of practices implemented in \nthe watershed. These targeted sites will be combined with randomly selected sites to \nassess the fish community and the fishery. Data collected will include the information \nnecessary for stock assessments by MDWFP as well as data on species composition, \nrichness and diversity.  \n \n \n Budget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries management on Wolf Lake are found in Table 5. \n \nTable 5.

Sediment \nloading from construction sites is of minimal concern now, but as more development \ntakes place it could present a problem in the future.  If local stakeholders are willing, the \nparticipants plan to work with residents in the watershed and provide any assistance with \ndeveloping a homeowners association or other organization of that nature.  Once \nestablished, MDEQ can provide guidance and technical assistance on how development \ncan occur with minimal impacts on water quality and the environment.   \n \nBudget \n \nBecause only technical assistance and advice would be provided, no budget was \ndeveloped for this item. \n \n   \n \n \nEducation Strategy \n \nGoal \n \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Wolf Lake watershed is to develop \nan atmosphere that promotes sustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. Specific objectives of education efforts in the watershed \ninclude the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n\n 22 \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Wolf \nLake watershed. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi Depar\n\ntment of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members.  Delta Wildlife and F.A.R.M. also make educational \npresentations at schools and to various civic organizations.  A portion of these efforts will \nbe targeted towards landowners and residents in this watershed.  This implementation \nplan will also be available on both organization’s website along with information for \nlandowners in the watershed who wish to participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will \nbe designed and offered free of charge to increase awareness and stakeholder \nparticipation in the WIP process.  Press releases and additional information will made \navailable to the public by MDEQ on their website and other avenues.  Articles in popular \nmagazines such as the Mississippi Sportsman will also serve to educate the general public \non activities occurring in the watershed. \n \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nAn automated, long term monitoring station will be constructed at a location to be \ndetermined in cooperation with Delta F.A.R.M., Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality and Mississippi State University. This system will be built around \nEureka Environmental Manta multi-probe with their Eagle Eye remote data telemetry \nsystem. At a minimum the remote monitoring station will provide near real time \nmonitoring of water temperature, turbidity (EPA method 180.1) and water level. Data \nwill be retrieved from the unit either by satellite of cell phone telemetry based on cost and \nservice availability. A specific maintenance and calibration schedule will be determined \nin conjunction with the manufacturer’s recommendations and experience developed \noperating the station. \n \n\n 23 \nIn addition to the permanent water quality monitoring station described above, regular \n(monthly) sampling will occur to monitor turbidity, total suspended solids, water \ntemperature, dissolved oxygen pH, and specific conductance of surface waters.  All \nparameters, except for total suspended solids, will be measured in-situ using a flow-\nthrough system (Eureka Manta multi-probe) while traveling along the length of the lake. \nThis system will pump small volumes of lake water from the lake, through a \nmanufacturer supplied flow-cell which houses the sensors, and back to the lake. \nSimultaneous recording of position (GPS coordinates) and these parameters will allow \nthe assembly of a geo-referenced set of water quality data that can be correlated to \nspecific management practices implemented in the basin. Additionally we will be able to \n“map” the distribution of water quality conditions across the surface of the lake using this \ndata.  Finally water samples will be collected from 20 randomly selected locations \nmonthly in conjunction with the surface water turbidity/water quality measurements. \nThese 20 sites will be changed monthly to ensure appropriate representation of the \nconditions across the surface of the lake. All locations will be identified and reported to \nMDEQ using GPS.  Samples will be brought back and analyzed at the Mississippi State \nUniversity Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Water Quality Laboratory.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssessment of progress  \n \nProgress for this watershed implementation plan will be assessed and evaluated five (5) \nyears (2008-2012).  The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan \ngoals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 6.2%/year \n• Reduction of TBODu by 9.6%/year \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Wolf Lake Watershed Implementation \nTeam beginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a \ndetailed schedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \n\n 24 \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Wolf Lake surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Wolf Lake watershed quality will be revised based on knowledge \nthat has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \n \n \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO, Organic Enrichment, Nutrients.  Wolf Lake is  \nlisted for Organic Enrichment and Nutrients although all of \nthe causes and standards are not known.  Agricultural \nBMP’s should address these issues along with sediment. \n1c.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nagricultural BMPs. \n1d. Fisheries Management.  MDWFP and MSU will \ncontinue to monitor the fishery and develop lake depth \nmaps, management plans, and determine if agricultural \nBMP’s have an impact on the fish community. \n1e. Housing Development.  Delta F.A.R.M. and MDEQ will \nwork with local stakeholders to address these concerns.   \nTable 1 \nAttain water quality parameters as stated by TMDL’s Page 14-15 \nWater Control Structures (200 units minimum) \nRip-Rap weirs (20 sites minimum) \nBank Stabilization (20 sites minimum) \nWetland Construction and Hydrology Restoration (50 acres) \nBank Stabilization (20 sites minimum) \nRiparian Buffers/Grass Filter Strips (100 acres minimum) \n \nPage 17 \nAg BMP $1,807,500.00 \nFisheries Management $17,698.00 \nTOTAL $1,825,198.00 \nTables 4 and 5 \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Wolf \nLake watershed is to develop an atmosphere that promotes \nsustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. \nPage 22 \nImplementation will be dependent on the cooperation of the \nprivate landowners. \nPage 16 \nThere are current plans for water quality monitoring in Wolf \nLake Watershed. \nPage 23 \n \n \n\n 28 \n \n ",
