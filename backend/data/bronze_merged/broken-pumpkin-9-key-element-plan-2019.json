According to the 2011 National Land Cover Database \n(NLCD), the landuse within this watershed is comprised of approximately 37% cropland, 20% \npastureland, 27% wetlands, 10% forestland, and 6% other (water, scrub/barren, and urban) \n(Figure 1). \n \nThe water-use classification for Broken Pumpkin Creek, as established by Regulations for Water \nQuality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters (11 Miss. Admin. Code Pt. 6, Ch. \n2), is Fish and Wildlife. Waters with this classification are intended for fishing and propagation \nof fish, aquatic life, and wildlife. Waters included in the Fish and Wildlife Classification should \nalso be suitable for secondary contact, which is defined as incidental contact with water \nincluding wading and occasional swimming.   \n \nMDEQ has conducted statewide biological monitoring using benthic macroinvertebrates as the \nindicator to develop a regionally-calibrated Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) for wadeable \nstreams. This index, known as the Mississippi Benthic Index of Stream Quality (M-BISQ), was \nused in the biological assessment of the State’s wadeable streams and rivers including Broken \nPumpkin Creek. Based on the M-BISQ scores, this water body was determined to be impaired. \nTherefore, Broken Pumpkin Creek (MS031BPE) was placed on the Mississippi 2002 Section \n303(d) List of Impaired Water Bodies (MDEQ, 2002a) for Biological Impairment. A stressor \nidentification study was then completed for the Broken Pumpkin Creek watershed to determine \nthe most likely cause(s) of the impairment. This analysis identified sediment as the primary \nprobable stressor of the water body and a TMDL was developed in 2007.  This TMDL was \nupdated in 2010 to include Kincaide Creek (MS033K); however, this segment is not part of the \nBroken Pumpkin Creek Watershed and therefore is not considered in this watershed plan.     \n \nThere are no facilities in the Broken Pumpkin Creek watershed with NPDES permits that include \nlimits for Total Suspended Solids (TSS) which is used as an indicator of sediment contributions \nfrom permitted activities. The pollutant of concern for the Updated Total Maximum Daily Load \nTombigbee Ricer Basin Designated Streams in HUCs 03106105 (Luxapallila Creek) and \n03160106 (Middle Tombigbee River) (MDEQ, 2006) TMDL, which includes Broken Pumpkin \nCreek, is sediment from land-use runoff and in-channel processes.  This TMDL was developed \nfor clean sediment. Certain contaminants may be associated with sediment such as pesticides and \nnutrients. These contaminants were not addressed directly within this TMDL; however, these \ncontaminants would also be controlled by some of the same best management practices (BMPs) \nthat control the sediment from nonpoint sources of pollution.  The target for the TMDL was \nbased on reference sediment yields developed by the Channel and Watershed Processes Research \nUnit (CWPRU) at the National Sedimentation Laboratory (NSL).  Based on the ranges of stable \nand unstable yield values, a reduction in sediment of 77% to 97% is recommended in the Broken \nPumpkin Creek watershed.\n\nBroken Pumpkin Creek Watershed Plan FY19 \n2 \n \nFigure 1: Broken Pumpkin Creek Watershed Landuse \n\nBroken Pumpkin Creek Watershed Plan FY19 \n3 \n \n \nNonpoint loading of sediment in a water body results from the transport of the material into \nreceiving waters by several processes including mass wasting, head cutting, gullying, and sheet \nand rill erosion.  Sources of sediment come from improper agricultural and silviculture practices \nas well as from a plethora of other improper land-use activities, e.g. construction, mining, \nchannel alterations.  \n \nElement b: Expected Load Reduction \n \nThe sediment TMDL for Updated Total Maximum Daily Load Tombigbee Ricer Basin \nDesignated Streams in HUCs 03106105 (Luxapallila Creek) and 03160106 (Middle Tombigbee \nRiver) concluded that yields would need to be reduced by 77-97% within the watersheds in order \nto reflect stable conditions.  The USDA NRCS has a list of approved BMPS to address \nsedimentation and this list will be used to identify candidate BMPs in Broken Pumpkin Creek \nwatershed. \n \nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service has a list of approved BMPs to address \nsedimentation. This list will be used to identify candidate BMPs to be installed in the Broken \nPumpkin Creek Watershed.   \n \nElement c: Proposed Management Measures \n \nCoordinating partners with MDEQ include the Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation \nCommission (MSWCC), the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and the local Soil \nand Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) throughout the state.  These SWCDs are typically \nhoused within USDA Service Centers co-located with NRCS offices.  These USDA Service \nCenters handle federal assistance programs offered through the Farm Bill.  As part of these \nservices, SWCD staff communicate regularly with the local landowners and operators within the \nwatershed as they work to support sign-ups for Farm Bill initiatives   Staff from MSWCC and \nthe SWCD depend upon assistance from their NRCS partners in determining landowner interest \nin the watershed because they are on the farms and in the fields with the landowners, understand \nthe needs at the local level, and have knowledge of the amount of unfunded applications for \nfederal program assistance which meet Section 319 eligibility requirements.  Based on their \nanalysis, installation of the following BMPs would help to mitigate sediment issues in Broken \nPumpkin Creek watershed: brush management; weed management; prescribed burning; cover \ncrops; critical area planting; sediment basins; diversions; ponds; fencing; filter strips and field \nborders; firebreaks; grade stabilization structures; grassed waterways; irrigation pipeline; \nirrigation reservoirs; land clearing; forage and biomass planting; livestock management \npractices; streambank and shoreline protection; water control structures; terraces; underground \noutlets; habitat development and management; and forest stand improvements.  Factors \nconsidered for determining specific locations for the placement of BMPs included the following \nattributes based upon best professional judgement: \n \n1. Likely water quality benefit; \n2. Willing landowners; \n3. Implementation of the recommendations of the TMDLs (i.e., “It is recommended that \nwater bodies within [the watershed] be considered a priority for streambank and \n\nBroken Pumpkin Creek Watershed Plan FY19 \n4 \n \nriparian buffer zone restoration and any sediment reduction BMPs, especially for road \ncrossings, agricultural activities, and construction activities); \n4. Ease of showing effectiveness of the BMP(s) through monitoring; and \n5. Shorter length of time for anticipated results (i.e., within the grant period). \n \nElement d: Technical and Financial Assistance \n \nAs part of any Section 319 funded project, MDEQ requires a 40% match in project areas.  This \nmatch may be in the form of actual dollars or may be provided as “in-kind” to project activities.  \nPartners in this project that may contribute match include MSWCC, Noxubee County Soil and \nWater Conservation District and Lowndes County Soil and Water Conservation District, NRCS, \nUSGS (monitoring), and/or local landowners.  For project implementation, administration, \nmanagement, and watershed plan revision, as well as hosting and facilitating team meetings, \nMDEQ plans to work under a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the MSWCC to \nimplement this project.  Project partners provided the funding amounts used to estimate costs for \nBMP installation.

To maximize education and outreach activities and monitoring efforts, \nMDEQ plans to leverage with existing programs already allocated for funding where possible \n \nBelow is the estimated budget for the first incremental funding (Phase 1) of this project: \n \nCost Estimate: Phase 1 Implementation \n \nPractice Name Unit \nNo of \nUnits Unit Cost \nEstimated \nCost \nCover Crops ac 500 $55.86 $27,930.00 \nDiversion cu yd 8000 $2.40 $19,200.00 \nFencing ft 5509 $2.22 $12,229.98 \nGrade Stabilization Structure ea 8 $10,000.00 $80,000.00 \nForage and Biomass Planting ac 100 $109.48 $10,948.00 \nTerraces ft 25200 $1.59 $40,068.00 \n\nBroken Pumpkin Creek Watershed Plan FY19 \n6 \n \nTank/Trough ea 6 $2,500.00 $15,000.00 \nUnderground Outlet ft 1600 $5.39 $8,624.00 \n*Monitoring       $74,328.00 \n*Technical Assistance       $15,000.00 \n*Education/Outreach       $13,900.00 \n*Project Management, \nImplementation, Coordination, \nPlan Revision       $24,290.00 \n     \nPhase 1 Estimated Project Cost \n   \n$341,517.98 \n \nElement e: Information and Education \n \nThe MDEQ, in cooperation with numerous federal, state, and local stakeholders has developed \ndiversified information/education programs, best management practices manuals, literature, \nbooks, videos, and public service announcements that address pollutants from the seven (7) \nmajor landuse categories of Nonpoint Source Pollution, namely; agriculture, construction, \nforestry, on-site waste water disposal, surface mining, urban storm water runoff, and hydrologic \nmodification.  Audiences from pre-school to adults throughout the state are reached with a \nvariety of mature, well-designed programs each year. These programs, events, manuals and \nliterature can be used in the Broken Pumpkin Creek watershed project by tailoring them to \naddress the sedimentation.  A positive approach is used to reach the full diversity of people in the \ncommunity with projects that foster a “sense of place”, a “sense of pride in community”, and a \nsense of the native plants, animals, and general ecology of their region, as well as, the history of \nthe community and a sense of economics.  Stakeholders and coordinators join together to \nparticipate in problem-solving, brainstorming, plan development, training workshops, festival \nevent planning, soil and water conservation field days, tree boards, poster, art and writing \nprojects and other activities that promote collaboration and ownership of the watershed, as well \nas, solutions to its problems.  The ultimate goal is to bring about behavior changes and the use of \n“best management practices” that will improve water quality and the overall quality of life in the \nwatershed.  Evaluation forms, pre-test/ post-test, surveys, and reporting of the number of people \nwho attend workshops, trainings and events are among the methods used to measure the success \nof education/information programs.  A partial list of MDEQ’s programs that could be used in the \nBroken Pumpkin Creek watershed are listed below: \n \n Water Model Presentations - Enviroscapes and groundwater aquifer models distributed \nstatewide with training and related interactive lesson plans. \n Teacher Workshops – train educators in proximity to the watershed about NPS pollution \nand provide materials and information that can be used in their classrooms. \n Adopt A Stream - workshops and training venues for citizens, teachers, and students in \nthe Dry Creek Watershed. \n  Watershed Harmony Mobile Classroom - for ages kindergarten – adults with state and \nfederal public education objectives tailored for 4\nth\n and 5\nth\n grade students. \n  “Train the Trainer” - workshops and materials for Soil and Water districts, Extension \nService, etc. \n\nBroken Pumpkin Creek Watershed Plan FY19 \n7 \n \n \nAs part of the education outreach efforts, the stakeholder group forming the Broken Pumpkin \nCreek Watershed Implementation Team (WIT) will participate in a minimum of 3 face-to-face \nmeetings.  The purpose of these meetings is to provide updates on implementation activities, \neducation events and review and modify the watershed plan.  In concert with these WIT \nmeetings, and to incentivize stakeholder participation, project funding will be used to purchase \nfood and other refreshments for the WIT along with providing support for renting facilities in \nwhich to host those events.  In accordance with 41 CFR § 301-74.11, light refreshments, meals, \nand/or beverages are an allowable expense under CWA Section 319, provided a description of \nthe agenda, purpose, location, costs, etc., are outlined in an approved 319 grant workplan. The \npurpose of the meetings will be for updating the watershed plan, and hosting field days to \nshowcase the implemented BMPs for the public. At this time the exact number of participants \nand locations are not known therefore costs have been estimated for the purposes of this plan and \nwill be updated. \n \nElement f: Implementation Schedule \n \nIn the event of a Section 319 NPS funding award from MDEQ to support implementation of this \nwatershed-based plan for this HUC 12 sub-watershed, MDEQ, along with support from the \nWatershed Implementation Team and Project Manager (where applicable), will: \n \n1.

The narrative standard is \nthat waters shall be free from materials attributable to municipal, industrial, agricultural, or other \ndischargers producing color, odor, taste, total suspended solids, or other conditions in such \ndegree as to create a nuisance, render the waters injurious to public health, recreation, or to \naquatic life and wildlife, or adversely affect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair \nthe waters for any designated uses. In lieu of numeric criteria for sediment, the monitoring will \nbe conducted to collect data on parameters that are considered surrogates for sediment \nconcentrations and may include measurements for Total Suspended Solids, Total Suspended \nSediment, and turbidity along with conventional parameters generally measured to determine \naquatic health (e.g. Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Temperature, Conductivity, Dissolved Solids). The \nfollowing thresholds will be used to measure compliance with water quality criteria and/or target \nthresholds:  \n \nParameter Threshold \nDissolved Oxygen Daily Average of 5.0 mg/L; Instantaneous threshold of 4.0 mg/L \nDissolved Oxygen % Sat ≥ 70% - ≤ 125% \npH 6.0-9.0 \nTemperature Not to exceed 90°F \nSpecific Conductance Less Than 1000 micromhos/cm \nDissolved Solids \nMonthly average less than 750 mg/L; instantaneous threshold less \nthan 1500 mg/L \nTotal Suspended Solids 65 mg/L \nTurbidity 75 NTU \nDissolved Solids \nMonthly average less than 750 mg/L; instantaneous threshold less \nthan 1500 mg/L \nChemical Oxygen \nDemand 35 mg/L \nM-BISQ East Bioregion \n71.6 Calibration 3 (Applicable to waters outside the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain) \n \nIn addition to chemical data, biological community data and in stream habitat surveys will be \ncollected over the course of the project to determine attainment of the Aquatic Life Designated \nUse. These data are extremely helpful in identifying positive trends in water quality and should \nprovide information to help determine if the implementation activities are resulting in water \nquality improvements. For freshwater wadeable streams, not including the Mississippi Alluvial \nPlain (i.e. Delta), Mississippi uses a calibrated and verified index of biotic integrity to make \nwater quality assessment decisions. This index, the Mississippi Benthic Index of Stream Quality \n(M-BISQ) was originally developed in 2000 and has undergone three recalibration efforts to \nrefine the sensitivity of the index. As part of the index development process, the state was \ndivided into unique bioregions. Within each bioregion, the index has a defined attainment \n\nBroken Pumpkin Creek Watershed Plan FY19 \n10 \n \nthreshold that is used to determine if the biological community measures collected at a site are \nrepresentative of good water quality that can support a balanced benthic macroinvertebrate \ncommunity. If the score is above the attainment threshold for the bioregion, the site is assessed as \nattaining the aquatic life use designation. Broken Pumpkin Creek is located in the East bioregion \nand was determined to be impaired in 2002 compared to the bioregional reference conditions. \nAlong with overall MBISQ scores, the in-stream habitat surveys will also be used to determine \nchange over time.  \n \nIt should be noted that recovery time of a stream is variable and may extend beyond the \ntimeframe identified in the workplan. At the end of the project, data will be analyzed to \ndetermine if the data indicate improvements to water quality in Broken Pumpkin Creek. In the \nevent data indicate little or no positive change, a Stressor Analysis will be conducted to \ndetermine if any new or additional stressors are preventing improvements to water quality. If any \nnew stressors are identified, the Watershed Implementation Team will identify future \nactions/activities to address those stressors. \n \nElement i: Monitoring \n \nPrior to BMP installation, water quality chemical and biological monitoring was conducted and \nwill serve as baseline data for the project along with any historical data available on Broken \nPumpkin Creek. This varied water quality monitoring included water chemistry data (nutrients, \nsuspended solids, oxygen demand, chlorides, etc.), in-situ field measurements for such \nparameters as dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, specific conductance, and turbidity, as well as \nbiological community monitoring for benthic macroinvertebrates. Historical monitoring stations \nand already scheduled monitoring sites outside of this workplan effort are shown in Figure 2 \nwith the types of monitoring data that have and/or will be collected provided in the table below.  \n \n \nStation \nID \nWater \nBody \nSample \nYear(s) \nCollecting \nAgency \nProject Water \nChem \nIn-\nSitu \nBenthics \nand/or \nAlgal \nTB146 Broken \nPumpkin \nCreek \n2019 MDEQ MBISQ X X X \nTB562 Broken \nPumpkin \nCreek \n2002 MDEQ MBISQ X X X \n \nPost-BMP monitoring locations will be selected using best professional judgement and will be \ntargeted to reflect water quality downstream of BMP activity. Once BMP installation is \ncomplete, and there has been sufficient time for the stream to stabilize, post BMP monitoring \nwill be initiated. Post BMP monitoring will be conducted in a way that allows for comparison \nwith the pre-implementation data. Because recovery periods of streams can be dependent on type \nand amount of BMPs installed, more than 1 year of post BMP data may be needed to observe a \nchange in water quality. In some cases, it may take 5 or more years to see full benefits of BMPs. \nAll data collection efforts will be conducted using trained personnel following established \nStandard Operating Procedures and adhering to agency Quality Assurance protocols. \n\nBroken Pumpkin Creek Watershed Plan FY19 \n11 \n \n \nFigure 2: Monitoring Stations Broken Pumpkin Creek Watershed ",
