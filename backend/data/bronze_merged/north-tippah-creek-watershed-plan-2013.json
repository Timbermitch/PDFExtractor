EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n \n North Tippah Creek Watershed has been identified as a priority watershed by the \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality.  North Tippah Creek is listed on Mississippiâ€™s \n2012 303(d) List of Impaired Water bodies for biological impairment.  The Mississippi Soil and \nWater Conservation Commission, Tippah County Soil and Water Conservation District and \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service thought a great impact on water quality could be \nmade in this watershed. MSWCC submitted a proposal to educate landowners/operators about \nwater quality and measures they can take to help improve the water quality in this watershed. \nThat proposal was selected for funding by MDEQ and a contract was awarded to MSWCC.  \nUnder that contract, MSWCC is required to assemble a Watershed Implementation Team to \naddress other issues and concerns within the watershed and write a Watershed Implementation \nPlan. The USGS will be monitoring waters within the watershed to determine the water quality \nand if there is a need for additional Best management Practices (BMPs) to be installed.  \n The key natural resource problems in this watershed are thought to be nutrient loading \nand sedimentation.  The Watershed Implementation Plan has the goals of reducing the nutrients \nand sediment entering the streams and creeks in the watershed, and meeting water quality \nstandards in the North Tippah Creek Watershed.  To help solve this problem, one of the \nmanagement actions is to implement a 319 water quality educational project within the \nwatershed.  The targeted area for this project is land in Tippah County that lies within the \nwatershed boundaries.  This is a one year project that will end in September of 2013.  The groups \nthat will be implementing the management action of educating landowner/operators about water \nquality include the Tippah County Soil and Water Conservation District, Natural Resources \nConservation Service, and the Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  The \nTippah County Soil and Water Conservation District and the Natural Resources Conservation \nService can be contacted at 662-837-4464 ext. 3 for information and assistance about this \nmanagement action.  \n \n\n \nTable 1.1 North Tippah Creek Watershed Management Action Plan \n \n \n \n \n7 \nGoal Who What  Where When Contacts \nReduce nutrient and sediment   \nloading, achieve standards for Low \nDO/Organic enrichment and \nnarrative standards for nutrient \nloading, and Fish and Wildlife \nSupport designated use  \nMSWCC,  \nUSDA NRCS, Tippah \nCounty Soil and Water \nConservation District \nContinue existing programs and projects \nrelated to landowner/operator education, \nBMP implementation, and habitat \nconservation \nEntire \nwatershed \n2012-2013 Mark Gilbert, MSWCC  \n601-354-7645 \nNRCS \n662-287-7223 ext. 3 \nTippah Co.

VISION STATEMENT \n \n  The vision of the North Tippah Creek Watershed Implementation Team is to improve \nand/or protect the water quality of streams and creeks in the watershed through the effective \nmanagement of agricultural and other land use activities.  This is a place where people want to live, \nwork, recreate and raise a family.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIII. MISSION STATEMENT \n \n  The mission of the North Tippah Creek Watershed Implementation Team is to educate \nlandowners on the use and effects of new/innovative BMPs and land use planning methods that will help \nattain designated water body uses in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 9 \nIV.

WATERSHED DESCRIPTION \n The North Tippah Creek watershed consists of approximately 35,521 acres.  The land uses for \nthe North Tippah Creek Watershed include approximately 3,553 acres of pastureland (10%), 8,881 acres \nof forestlands (25%), 21,316 acres of cropland (60%), and 1,776 acres other (5%).   Figure 5.1 shows the \nland uses in the North Tippah Creek watershed.  \n North Tippah Creek is located in the western portion of Tippah County, Mississippi (Figure 5.2).   \nThis watershed is located in a rural area with a sparse population of about 1,800 to 2,000.  Portions of \nthe towns of Ripley and Blue Mountain are located in this watershed.  Economic conditions that \ninfluence this watershed include the closing of industry jobs and low timber prices.  The significant \nchanges in land use in this watershed in the last 20 years are pastureland being converted to cropland.  \nTheer are no historical events or customs that have affected the culture in the watershed.   \n The soils in the watershed include Wilcox-Dulac-Falkner association (somewhat poorly drained \nand moderately well drained silty and clayey soils with slopes less than 17 percent), Ruston-Cutbert-Ora \nassociation (well drained to moderately well drained sandy soils) and Falaya-Urbo-Waverly association \n(somewhat poorly drained silty and clayey soils on wide stream bottoms).  The foregoing soil types are \ndeveloped on the outcropping Porterâ€™s Creek formation, a marine clay depositional unit. \nNorth Tippah Creek watershed is located in the Northern Hilly Gulf Coastal Plains and \nFlatwoods/Blackland Prairie Margins ecoregions.  The wetland areas in the watershed are typically the \nareas that have backwater from the watershed structures.  \n Other named water bodies in the watershed include South Tippah Creek, Medlock Branch, \nBowling Branch, and Little Burger Branch.  There are no state or federal parks, wildlife management \nareas, national forest or other significant environmental management areas within the watershed. \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n 11\n \n\n \n 12\n \n\n \n 13\n\n \n 14\nVI. STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS \n \n   \nStakeholders in the watershed want to restore the watershed creeks and streams to a state of good \nwater quality.  The stakeholders also want to conserve and preserve the soil, water and wildlife habitat.  \nBy reducing runoff (stopping erosion and loss of topsoil) and improving habitat for fish and wildlife, \nstakeholders believe that water quality can be improved. Trees and shrubs that have washed into the \ncreeks and streams during heavy rainfall events have led to piles of debris catching on snags along the \ncreek side and slowing down the flow of the water.  Damage from beavers in the watershed is extensive.  \nThe large dams built by the beavers have also been responsible for large areas of debris that slows down \nthe water.  This has caused retarded water flow leading to localized flooding.   Due to the geography of \nthe area in the watershed, creeks rise and fall quickly adding to the flooding issue.  Once the flood \nwaters recede the topsoil is washed away taking nutrients and chemicals with it.  This increases the \npotential of starting head cuts and gullies and increasing the instability of the banks of the streams, while \nleaving debris in pastures and on cropland.  Stakeholders think utilizing a beaver control program would \nhelp reduce the sediment and nutrients entering the streams.  This would, in turn, help reduce the \nsediment and nutrients entering the streams.   \nIt is the concern of the landowners that sediment and other contaminants will affect the water \nquality in the watershed.  Another concern of the landowners is the nutrient loading into the streams \nfrom pastureland.  This could be addressed by fencing cattle out of the streams and providing alternative \nwater sources for the cattle.  The landowners are concerned with the degradation and contamination of \nthe natural springs located throughout the watershed.  The stakeholders would like to protect the natural \nsprings that are located in this watershed.  These issues and concerns occur throughout the watershed \ndue to it being a rural area in Tippah County. \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 15\nVII. Water Resources \n \nA. History of Activity in the Watershed \n \n The primary players in restoration and /or conservation efforts in the North Tippah Creek \nWatershed are the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Tippah County Soil and Water \nConservation District and the Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission.  Local landowners \nand operators will play a major role in the restoration and conservation of the natural resources in this \nwatershed by installing best management practices on their land and implementing the activities learned \nin this educational project.  Several environmental and agricultural conservation programs have been \nutilized by landowners in the watershed in past years.  These programs include the Environmental \nQuality Incentive Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Emergency Watershed \nProgram (EWP), Hold Our Topsoil (HOT), and the Agricultural Conservation Program (ACP).  These \nprograms have helped many landowners apply conservation practices on the ground while reducing soil \nloss, enhancing wildlife habitat, enhancing water quality, conserving water quantity, increasing \nagriculture/silviculture production and promoting conservation education.    \n In May 2012, NRCS launched a new National Water Quality Initiative (NWQI) committed to \nimproving Pelahatchie Creek-Ashlog Creek, Porter Bayou and North Tippah Creek watersheds in \nMississippi.   NRCS identified these priority watersheds with the help of MDEQ and other partners.  \nNRCS manages the initiative by making funds available to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to \nhelp reduce the flow of nutrients, sediment and other pollutants into these impaired streams. \n As the management agency for Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution in Mississippi, the \nMississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission (MSWCC) determined that the North Tippah \nCreek Watershed would be a good candidate for education and possible restoration.  After meetings with \nlocal landowners, Tippah County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) commissioners and \nstaff and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) employees that work in this area, the \nMSWCC thought there was enough interest in the watershed that a measurable difference could be \nshown, and submitted a proposal to MDEQ for a Nonpoint Source Pollution Grant (#C9994866-11-0) \nunder the provisions of section 319(h) of the Clean Water Act.   \n \n \n\n \n 16\nB. Wildlife and Fisheries \nThere are important recreational species located throughout the watershed.  These species \ninclude deer, turkey, bass, catfish, bream, rabbits, squirrel, and raccoon.  Also, trapping is an important \nrecreation that takes place in this watershed.   The list of plants and animals of special concern are \nincluded as Appendix A.  There are no animals and plants that are threatened or endangered in this \nwatershed. \n \nC. Designated Use Classifications and Water Quality                 \n     Standards \n \n The designated beneficial uses for the North Tippah Creek and other water bodies  in the \nwatershed are aquatic life support, fish consumption and secondary contact.  The water use classification \nfor North Tippah Creek is fish and wildlife support according to the 2012 303 (d) List of Impaired Water \nBodies.  The Mississippi Benthic Index of Stream Quality (M-BISQ) was used for assessment of North \nTippah Creek.  MDEQ developed the M-BISQ for use as a tool to help assess water quality of \nMississippiâ€™s streams. \n \n \n \nD. Current Status of Water Bodies in the Watershed \n \n North Tippah Creek is listed on the Mississippi list of impaired water bodies (303 (d) list for biological \nimpairment \nE. TMDL \n    A TMDL has not been developed for North Tippah Creek.  EPA Region 4 encourages local \nwatershed restoration efforts that are developed in advance of TMDLs.  This approach provides the \nstate an \n\nopportunity to work with the public and private stakeholders to develop a watershed \nimplementation plan that should help improve water quality without the need for a TMDL.  The North \nTippah Creek Watershed is being used to pilot this approach. \n  \n \n \n\n \n 17\nVIII. WATERSHED MANAGEMENT  \nACTIONS \n \nImplementation of Best Management Practices  \n \nA. Nutrient and Sediment BMPs  \n \n1. Stakeholder Interests \n \n The major concerns of the stakeholders include nutrient and sediment loadings to water bodies in \nthe North Tippah Creek watershed.  Sediment runoff is a major issue because nutrients attach to \nsediment particles.   \n \n2. Goals/Objectives \n \n The goal/objective is to reduce the nutrient and sediment loading coming from agricultural and \nother land use activities in an effort to restore impaired water bodies in the North Tippah Creek \nWatershed prior to developing TMDLs.  This approach provides Mississippi an opportunity to restore \nthe impaired North Tippah Creek Watershed without the need for a TMDL.  \n \n3. Management Actions \n \n The management actions that will be taken to address nutrient and sediment loadings may \ninvolve installation of agricultural BMPs, water quality monitoring, public outreach/education and other \nmeasures.  These BMPs may include but are not limited to:  \nï‚· Stream bank and Shoreline Protection,  \nï‚· Grade Stabilization Structures,  \nï‚· Critical Area Stabilization, and other. \n \n  These BMPs will be installed by the participating landowners in the watershed utilizing funds \nthrough the NRCS National Water Quality Initiative (NWQI).  NRCS will provide the \ntechnical/planning assistance including funding for this BMP implementation.  Most of the BMPs that \nwill be installed are permanent structures and must be maintained by the landowner for a period of 10 \n\n \n 18\nyears.  NRCS and Tippah County Soil and Water District employees identified landowners in the \nwatershed that have agricultural land needing treatment.   \n \n4. Project Tracking/Assessment of Progress \n \n The North Tippah Creek project began in 2012.  NRCS is tracking progress of this project \nutilizing the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) on all acres affected by the Best \nManagement Practices (BMPs); also MDEQ will evaluate the monitoring data collected by USGS to \ndetermine effectiveness of the installed BMPs. \n                          \n \n5. Desired Results/Benefits \n \n The desired benefit of this project will be to restore and remove the impaired segments of North \nTippah Creek from Mississippiâ€™s 303(d) List of Impaired Water bodies. \n \n6. Roles/Responsibilities \n \n There are several different groups with responsibilities in this watershed.  NRCS staff has the \nroles and responsibilities of identifying landowners, providing technical assistance, designing the BMPs \nand making payments to the landowners who install the BMPs.  The landowners have the responsibility \nof implementing BMPs in the project area.  The North Tippah Creek Watershed Implementation Team \nhas the role of helping gather the information needed to write the Watershed Implementation Plan.  \nMSWCC has the responsibility of compiling all the information and writing the initial plan for the \nwatershed and carrying out the 319 education project.  Other programs that are available to landowners \nin the watershed include EQIP, CRP, and WHIP.  Under these three programs, there has been \napproximately $375,506 spent over the last three years with another $416,000 projected to be spent over \nthe next three years in Tippah County. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 19\n7.

EVALUATION \n \nA. Plan Evaluation Procedure \n \n This watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised on an as needed basis.  The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the North Tippah Creek WIT.  At that time, the WIT will \ndevelop a detailed schedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The WIT \nmembers will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the opportunity to propose changes \nto the watershed implementation plan. One month will be allowed for notification of stakeholders. \n The plan will be evaluated by the team, or their designee, and any interested stakeholders. One \nmonth will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. Therefore, comments will be due \ntwo months after the evaluation procedure is initi\n\nated. The plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, \nto determine if the plan goals have been achieved, and second, to determine if it restores the water \nquality of North Tippah Creek and addresses priority issues as identified by the WIT. \n \n \nB. Implementation Evaluation Strategy \n \n1. The following measures and indicators of progress will be utilized to track the              \nsuccess of this plan by MSWCC:  \n \nï‚· The number of individuals who attend the Tippah County Fair,  \nï‚·    The number of fact sheets and brochures distributed, \nï‚· The number of children who attend the Conservation Carnival, \nï‚· The number of teachers who attend the workshops, and \nï‚· The number of individuals what attend the field day. \n \n \n 2.  MDEQ will be responsible for reviewing water quality monitoring data collected during \nthe implementation of this project to determine the effectiveness of BMPs implemented in the \nwatershed.   \n \n\n \n 31\nXI. PLAN REVISION \n \nA. Plan Revision Procedure \n \n  After evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan incorporating \nthe changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to call a meeting to \nreconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n If the evaluation criteria are all being met in North Tippah surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, in order to \nprotect the water quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria for the watershed are not being \nmet, the approach for restoring North Tippah Creek watershed will be revised based on the \nknowledge that has been gained through BMP installation and monitoring performed in the NWQI \narea.  \n The draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, and all \nothers who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft watershed implementation \nplan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the availability of the revised \nwatershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. One month will be allowed for review of the \ndraft. Comments will be due at the end of this review period. \n Within a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are received, the \nDRAFT watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review \nand approval. After the DRAFT watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of the plan for \nuse as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n 32\n \nXII.
