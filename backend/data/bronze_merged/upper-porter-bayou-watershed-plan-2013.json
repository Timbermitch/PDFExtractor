The 20,190 acre Porter Bayou Watershed (HUC # 080302070503) includes parts of \nBolivar and Sunflower Counties, Mississippi (Figure 2.1). The watershed is located in the Delta \n physiographic region, in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, Northern Holocene Meander Belts \necoregion. Geology in this area consists of mostly unconsolidated deposits of sands, silts, and \nclays dating back as far as the Pleistocene (Stewart 2003). Only one municipality exists in the \nwatershed, the City of Shaw (Figure 2.1). Several smaller communities are scattered around the \nwatershed including Choctaw, Fraizer, and Linn. State Highways 61, 278, and 442 pass through \nthe watershed. Cleveland and Indianola are two larger municipalities in close proximity (i.e., \nwithin 10 miles). \n \n \n \n2.2    Soils \n \n Soils in the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain physiographic region are primarily young \nsoils (inceptisols) formed on alluvium, and range from mildly acidic to mildly alkaline (Stewart \n2003). The 20,190 acre watershed is diverse, ranging from frequently flooded areas with heavy \nclay soils to well drained “cotton ground” with sandy loam soils. Alligator (poorly drained clay), \nDundee (moderately to somewhat poorly drained fine sandy loam to silty clay loam), and \nForestdale (somewhat poorly to poorly drained silty clay loam) soils are predominant throughout \nthe watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.1. Upper Porter Bayou Watershed, Mississippi \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.3    Hydrology \n \nThe headwaters of Porter Bayou vary from roadside ditches to stream remnants coursing \nthrough marginal agricultural lands. The tributaries merge in the southeast corner of Bolivar \nCounty, MS. Traveling downstream, the bayou meanders through parts of Bolivar and Sunflower \nCounties in a large “horseshoe” fashion. Certain portions of the bayou are wide with gently \nsloping banks defined by cypress trees, while other portions are extremely narrow with high, \nsteep banks. Eventually, Porter Bayou empties in to the Sunflower River north of Indianola, MS. \n Non-storm flows in Delta streams naturally decrease during summer months due to \nlow rainfall. However, in the Porter Bayou watershed, irrigation water often supplements \nsummer non-storm flows by providing a constant source of runoff throughout the growing \nseason. \nThe watershed is characterized by poor drainage. The slow, meandering nature of the \nbayou has resulted in the accumulation of sediments and dense vegetation, both of which \nnegatively impact drainage. \n \n \n \n2.4    Land use \n \nA map of watershed land use is shown in Figure 2.2.  Agriculture is the predominant land \nuse in the watershed comprising about 15,896 acres or roughly 78% of the watershed. Soybeans \nare the most common crop but corn, cotton, and rice are all common. In addition to production \nagriculture, there are roughly 1,000 acres of urban development, 2,000 acres of woody wetland, \nand the rest being fallow/undeveloped or open water.  \n \n \n \n2.5    Socioeconomics \n \n2.5.1    Demographics \n \nAccording to the 2010 census, the population for Bolivar County was 34,145, and 29,450 for \n Sunflower County\n1\n. In Both counties the 2010 population was down from the 2008 estimated \npopulation. \n   \n \n  1 http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/sdc/estimates/2008/CO-EST2008-01-28.htm,  \n \n \n \n \n2-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.5.2    Economy \nThere are a handful of small businesses within Shaw, however the lifeblood of the \nwatershed is production agriculture. In addition to row crop agriculture, catfish farming is an \nimportant contributor to the economy of Sunflower County, and occurs but is diminishing in the \nPorter Bayou watershed (MSU 2009). The Delta region of Mississippi where Porter Bayou is \nlocated is classified as economically depressed. The estimated 2008 median household income \nfor Bolivar County ($28,779) and Sunflower County ($28,266) were both below the state median \nhousehold income ($37,818), and were in the lowest 11% of the state\n2\n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.2.

NPDES Point sources \nThere is one NPDES permitted wastewater discharge that discharges in the Porter Bayou \nwatershed. The Shaw Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) discharges in to Porter Bayou \n(permit # MS0024953). The Shaw POTW has a design flow capacity of 0.36 MGD. \n \n \n \n \n2.6.1.1.2. NPDES Stormwater \nThe Porter Bayou watershed does not appear to be subject to MS4 storm water \npermitting under the Clean Water Act. Construction activities disturbing an area greater than \n1 acre are subject to NPDES stormwater regulations. \n \n \n \n \n2.6.1.1.3. 303(d) and TMDLs \nPorter Bayou was placed on the Mississippi 2006 Section 303(d) List of Impaired Water \nBodies (MDEQ 2007). Porter Bayou was listed due to evaluated causes of sediment/siltation, \norganic enrichment/low dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and total toxics (Figure 2.3). The Clean \nWater Act requires that total maximum daily load (TMDL) studies be completed for all water \nbodies included on the 303(d) list. Table 2.1 summarizes the TMDLs addressing Porter Bayou \nwater quality impairments that have been completed as of June 2010. Because these TMDLs \nhave been completed, Porter Bayou does not appear on the draft 2010 303(d) list (MDEQ 2010). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.3.

TMDLs for Porter Bayou \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.6.1.1.4. Navigable Waters \nSeveral sections of the Clean Water Act deal with controlling impacts to navigable \nwaters. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act controls the placement of dredge or fill materials into \nwetlands and other waters of the US. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires MDEQ to \ncertify that a project requiring a Section 10 (see 2.6.1.2) or Section 404 permit will not violate \nthe state water quality standards. These sections of the Clean Water Act require that impacts to \nqualifying waterbodies be avoided or minimized. Where impacts are unavoidable, mitigation \nmay be required. Qualifying waterbodies include wetlands and “Other Waters of the US”. The \nbasic definition for Other Waters of the US, for the purpose of Section 404, is any waterbody \nthat displays an ordinary high water mark (OHWM). This includes lakes and ponds that have a \nhydrological connection to a qualifying waterbody, and perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral \nstream channels which exhibit an OHWM. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nadministers the regulations associated with both of these sections. \nThe USACE issues two types of permits under Section 404; Individual Permits and \nNationwide Permits (NWPs). Individual Permits are required when 1) impacts to wetlands \nexceed 0.5 acre, and/or 2) greater than 300 linear feet of a qualifying waterbody is to be \nimpacted. This Individual Permit includes a period of public review, and processing generally \ntakes between 60 and 120 days. The processing time can be greater if public hearings or \nenvironmental statements are required, or if all required information on the permit application \nform is not provided. NWPs are general permits typically used when minor impacts are \nnecessary to wetlands (less than 0.5 acre) or a qualifying waterbody (any impacts less than \n300 linear feet). Processing time is generally less and no public review period is necessary. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMitigation for both wetland losses or stream function and value losses may be required \nby the USACE for a project authorized under either an individual or nationwide permit. The \nextent of the mitigation is dependent upon the size, quality, and functionality of the wetland or \nwaterbody to be impacted. \n \n \n \n2.6.1.2 Rivers and Harbors Act \n \nSection 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act regulates activities that have the potential to \nobstruct navigation in waters of the US, including wetlands. \n \n \n2.6.1.3 Farm Bill \n \nUnder the Federal Food Security Act (Farm Bill), initially passed in 1985, all US farm \noperators are required to follow soil and wetland conservation guidelines specified in the law \n(i.e., Sodbuster and Swampbuster programs). Compliance with these guideline is a prerequisite \nfor participation in most federal farm programs. Subsequent amendments to the Farm Bill have \nadded programs that provide incentives to farm operators for enhancing water quality through \nsuch actions as taking highly erodible lands out of production, and restoring wetlands. One such \nprogram is the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative (MRBI). The MRBI is \nbeing implemented through NRCS programs funded by the Farm Bill, including the Cooperative \nConservation Partnership Initiative, Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program, and Conservation \nInnovation Grants. The Porter Bayou watershed is a target sub-watershed of the Sunflower River \nwatershed for the MRBI. \n \n \n \n2.6.1.4 National Flood Insurance Program \n \nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a non-regulatory federal program, \nwhich is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, this \nprogram provides mechanisms that can be used to restrict development in floodplains, which can \nhave beneficial effects on water quality. The NFIP supports development and enforcement of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfloodplain management plans and ordinances. All of the unincorporated areas of Bolivar and \nSunflower Counties participate in the NFIP, as well as the City of Shaw\n3\n. \n \n \n2.6.1.5 Safe Drinking Water Act \n \nAll drinking water systems serving 25 people or more are considered public drinking \nwater systems and are subject to EPA regulation through the Safe Drinking Water Act. Elements \nof the Safe Drinking Water Act include the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, \nDisinfection Byproducts Rule, and the requirement for Source Water Assessment and Protection. \nIn Mississippi, the Safe Drinking Water Act is administered by the Mississippi State Department \nof Health. The lists of public water utilities provided on the Mississippi State Department of \nHealth website indicate that there is one public water utility serving the residents of the Porter \nBayou watershed – the Town of Shaw\n4\n. According to the EPA Safe Drinking Water Information \nSystem, the Shaw utility water source is groundwater, it serves 2,319 people, and the only \ndrinking water quality standard violation was for fecal coliforms in 2002\n5\n. \n \n \n \n2.6.2    State \n2.6.2.1 Water quality standards \n \nThe water use classifications are established by the State of Mississippi in the document \nState of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters (MDEQ, \n2007). The designated beneficial use for Porter Bayou is Fish and Wildlife (MDEQ 2008). The water \nquality standard applicable to the use of the water body and the pollutant of concern is defined in the \nState of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters (MDEQ, \n2007). Mississippi’s current standards contain a narrative criteria that can be applied to nutrients \nwhich states “Waters shall be free from materials attributable to municipal, industrial, agricultural, \nor other discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, sediment, \nturbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the waters injurious to \npublic health, recreation, or to aquatic life and wildlife, or adversely affect the palatability of fish, \naesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated use (MDEQ, 2007).” \n \n3 http://www.msema.org/insurance/floodplain.html \n4 http://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/30,0,76,256.html \n5 http://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/sdw_form_v2.create_page?state_abbr=MS \n \n \n \n2-  9\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe standard for dissolved oxygen states, “DO concentrations shall be maintained at a \ndaily average of not less than 5.0 mg/l with an instantaneous minimum of not less than 4.0 mg/l.” In \naddition, the State water quality standard regulations include a natural condition clause which was \nused in the TMDL to determine the appropriate DO for Porter Bayou under critical conditions. \nNatural conditions are defined as background water quality conditions due only to non-anthropogenic \nsources. The DO numeric criteria apply specifically with regard to substances attributed to sources \n(discharges, nonpoint sources, or instream activities) as opposed to natural phenomena. Waters may \nnaturally have characteristics outside the limits established by these criteria. Therefore, naturally \noccurring conditions that fail to meet criteria should not be interpreted as violations of these criteria \n(MDEQ 2007). \n \n \n2.6.2.2 Highway Construction Runoff \n \nThe Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) is responsible for implementation \nof erosion and sediment control practices on highway construction. MDOT is required to apply to \nMDEQ for a Certificate of Permit Coverage for construction projects to be permitted through the \nstate construction storm water general permit. As of June 7, 2010, there are no active water \npermits for highway construction in the Porter Bayou watershed (MDEQ enSearch, accessed \nJune 2010). \n \n \n \n2.6.2.3 On-site wastewater treatment regulations \n \nState regulations addressing on-site wastewater treatment systems are administered \nthrough the Mississippi State Department of Health. Regulations are in place to address single- \nfamily residence on-site wastewater treatment systems, as well as on-site systems serving \nrecreational vehicle campgrounds, developments, and multi-family dwellings. These regulations \nrequire approval and certification of all new installations of on-site wastewater treatment \nsystems, including replacement of old systems. Certification is not required for systems in use \nprior to enactment of the regulations, providing they meet criteria specified in the regulations.\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\n http://www.msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/30,0,78.html,  \n \n \n \n2-  10\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.6.2.4 Fish consumption advisories \n \nFish tissue sampling is conducted by MDEQ for the purpose of identifying potential \nhuman health threats. These data are used by a multi-agency task force to evaluate the need for \nfish consumption advisories in Mississippi. Porter Bayou is included in the Delta-wide \nconsumption advisory for toxaphene and DDT. This advisory recommends that people limit \nconsumption of carp, buffalo, gar, and catfish larger than 22 inches to no more than one meal \nevery two weeks (MSDH 2001). \n \n \n \n2.6.2.5 Water Withdrawals \n \nUnder Mississippi law, all wells drilled with a casing diameter of 6 inches or greater are \nrequired to have a water use permit. In addition, water use permits are required for surface water \nwithdrawals, and construction of water storage impoundments. Permits are good for 10 years. \nThe Yazoo Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District (YMD) is responsible for \nprocessing water use permits in the Delta, including the Upper Porter Bayou watershed. Water use \npermits are issued by the MDEQ State Permit Board. Stakeholders are concerned about \nrequirements to meter groundwater withdrawals because of future implications. \n \n \n \n \n2.7    Existing management \n \nNumerous drainage improvement efforts have been made over the years, and intense \nefforts are ongoing by the New Porter Bayou Drainage District (NPBDD) including; 1) Stream \nBank Restoration, and 2) Alligator Weed Control and Eradication. Numerous sediment reducing \nBMPs have been voluntarily implemented throughout the watershed. Sediment reducing \nmeasures are also an integral part of NPBDD drainage projects. \nThe NRCS sponsored some watershed protection and flood prevention work in the \nwatershed around 2003 (CFR 68(10):2007) and Environmental Quality Incentives Program \n[EQIP] 7 CFR Part 1466).  More recently, U.S. EPA 319 funds were utilized to implement \ncomponents of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy within a small catchment in the headwaters \nof the Upper Porter Bayou Watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  11\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.0 RESOURCES AND CONDITION \n \n3.1    Water quality \nUSGS and MSU began water quality sampling in 2010 within the watershed. MSU began \nsampling at edge of field and near field locations in order to monitor water leaving agricultural \nfields. USGS began sampling in tributaries farther downstream and within Porter Bayou itself. \nThese monitoring efforts have led to a greater understanding of water quality within the bayou \nand leaving crop fields. As noted in Section 2.6.1.1.3, Lower Porter Bayou has be\n\nen identified by \nMDEQ as not having water quality adequate to support its designated uses (listed in Section \n2.6.2.1). However, this water quality assessment was an evaluated assessment, not based on water \nquality data.  \n \n  3.2    Water quantity \n \nWater supply is a growing concern in the region. Ground water depletion in the \nMississippi Alluvial Plain has resulted in lower flows in many streams, including the Sunflower \nRiver (MS Museum of Natural Science 2005). The Porter Bayou watershed is near the area of \ngreatest groundwater decline in the Delta (YMD 2008). In the watershed, ground water is \nwithdrawn for drinking water and to irrigate crops. \n \n \n \n3.3    Wildlife and Habitat \n \nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service has identified seven endangered or threatened \nspecies that may occur in or around the Porter Bayou Watershed. These species include; Fat \nPocket Book mussels, Rabbit’s Foot mussels, Sheepnose mussel, Least Tern, Pallid Stugeon \n(Occurs in Mississippi River), and Pondberry.  Efforts to protect or enhance the habitats of the \naforementioned species will be a high priority during the execution of the watershed plan. \nWhile the three mussels listed as endangered or threatened are normally found in larger \nriverine ecosystems restoration of streams in Porter Bayou may benefit these mussels. Least \nTerns will benefit greatly from shallow water management in wetlands and agricultural fields.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese shallow water areas provide ideal feeding location for these shore birds. Pallid Sturgeon will  \nbenefit due to the fact that water leaving Porter Bayou and entering the Sunflower River and  \neventually the MS River will be carrying less sediments and nutrients. Pondberry is an important  \nwetland species. With on-going and future projects Pondberry habitat may be increased or enhanced. \n \n \n3.4    Evaluation of Porter Bayou Fish Community \n \nThis evaluation of the Porter Bayou fish community is based on sampling performed by \nEDRC (Engineering Development and Research Center, US Army Corps of Engineers, \nVicksburg, MS). Sampling was performed as part of stream community monitoring conducted by \nERDC to assess the condition of fish communities in MS Delta streams. The sampling data \nprovided the basis for the development of an index of biotic integrity sensu Karr (1981). The \nindex uses metrics that capture the variety of feeding types (e.g. insectivores, predators), habitat \nselection (e.g. preferring current vs. pools) and taxonomy (e.g. sunfish and mninnows) present in \na sample of fish. Sampling was conducted with seines according to a standardized protocol. Each \nsampling site was assigned an IBI score based on the values of the population metrics. Streams \nwere categorized as large unregulated or small, and flowing or non-flowing. Higher IBI scores \nindicate a more diverse fish community. \nTwo Porter Bayou sampling locations were placed in the small flowing category while 3 \nlocations were placed in the flowing category. Sampling was conducted at all 5 locations on \nOctober 2 and 3, 1996 and showed IBI values ranging from 11 to 15 and 9 to 13 for the \nnon-flowing and flowing categories, respectively. These values are compared with other streams \nin both the flowing and non-flowing categories in Table 3.1. The results show that, at the time of \nsampling, the quality of the Porter Bayou fish communities could be described as generally in the \nlower quartile among similar streams. The applicability of these results, which were obtained \nin 1996, would depend on whether significant changes in habitat and water quality have occurred \nbetween 1996 and the present. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3-  2\n\n \nSmall \nNon-flowing \nSmall \nFlowing \nSmall Flowing + Non-Flowing \nPercentile \n25 11 13 13 \n50 14 15 15 \n75 17 17 17 \nPorter Bayou \nHwy 448 11 --  \nMiket Rd 15 --  \nBritt Rd. -- 10  \nIndianola -- 13  \nOlivehale -- 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 3.1.

The issues identified by these \nstakeholders included water management, sediment, nutrients, invasive aquatic plants, and declining \ngroundwater levels.  \n \n \n4.1    Water Management \n \nWater management issues include both flooding and water shortages. The stakeholders \nidentified flooding as a significant issue in the Upper Porter Bayou watershed. They also identified a \nneed for improved water use efficiency and storage capacity. The potential effects of \nimprovements, or lack thereof,  may impact flooding on other land parcels was also a stakeholder \nconcern. \n \n \n4.1.1    Locations Where Water Management is an Issue \nStakeholders stated that flooding is an issue throughout the watershed. Insufficient flow \ncapacity in the Porter Bayou channel upstream of Shaw and specifically behind the Trunk Line \nGas facility was identified by stakeholders as particular area of concern. \n \n    4.1.2    Causes \nDuring storms, water backs up and causes flooding. During the growing season, rainfall \nand surface water are not adequate to support crops. \n \n \n4.1.3    Sources \nTerrain in the watershed is relatively flat, making it less likely to drain well during \nstorms. In addition, the dominant soil types in the watershed are characterized by poor drainage. \nStakeholders identified sedimentation as contributing to flooding by reducing the conveyance capacity \nof ditches and streams.  Beaver dams were also identified by stakeholders as contributing to flooding \nin the watershed.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.2    Water Level Declines \n \nThe Porter Bayou watershed is near the area of greatest groundwater decline in the Delta \n(YMD 2008). Regional estimates of groundwater level change in the Delta indicate that between \n1998 and 2008 the average groundwater level change in the area of the Porter Bayou watershed \nwas between 0.4 and 0.9 foot per year (YMD 2008). \n \n \n \n4.2.1    Locations Where Water Level Declines are an Issue \nGroundwater levels are declining throughout the watershed (YMD 2008). \n \n \n \n4.2.2    Cause \nWater is being withdrawn from the Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer faster than it is \nbeing recharged. Base flows in most Delta streams naturally decrease during the summer months \ndue to less rainfall. \n \n \n \n4.2.3    Sources \nIrrigation accounts for the majority of the ground and surface water withdrawals in the \nLower Porter Bayou watershed. As noted in Section 2.6.1.5, groundwater is also used to supply \ndrinking water in the watershed. \n \n \n4.3    Sediment \n \nStakeholders noted that sedimentation in ditches and streams contributes to flooding by \nreducing storage and flow conveyance capacity. There is a clear understanding among producers \nand the NPBDD that sedimentation directly results in reduced drainage. Stakeholders identified \nchannel maintenance as a continual problem. The presence of herbicide-resistant weeds in the \nwatershed may result in increased cultivation (i.e., decreased no-till practice), which could \nincrease erosion and sediment loads. MDEQ has determined that there is a high probability that \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsediment loads in Porter Bayou are at such levels that they interfere with fish and other wildlife. \nHigh sediment loads can affect aquatic life by causing reduced visibility (when the sediment is \nsuspended in the water column) or by changing stream habitat when the sediment is deposited \n(e.g., covering spawning areas). The sediment TMDL recommended that sediment loads be \nreduced, although the recommended percent reduction was not specified. \n \n \n \n4.3.1    Locations Where Sediment is an Issue \nMDEQ has identified Upper Porter Bayou as not supporting its designated use of aquatic life \nsupport due to sediment. Producers, the NPBDD, and other stakeholders believe erosion and  \nsedimentation is an issue throughout the watershed. \n \n \n \n4.3.2    Cause \nSediment is the pollutant causing sedimentation and turbidity issues in Porter Bayou. \nSediment is caused by erosion of soil particles from land use activities in the watershed and \ndetachment of soil from the banks and beds of the bayou. Soils in the watershed tend to be fine \ngrained, which could make them more susceptible to erosion. \n \n \n \n4.3.3    Sources \nOn the Mississippi 2006 303(d) list, nonpoint sources are listed as the sources of \nsediment causing the impairment in Porter Bayou. In the sediment TMDL that addresses this \nimpairment, a number of likely sediment sources were identified. These included agriculture, \nconstruction sites, roads, urban areas, mass wasting, gullies, channel instability, channel \nmodification, and historical land use activities. The NPBDD has identified unstable banks as a \nsignificant source of sediment in Porter Bayou. \n \n \n4.4    Nutrient Enrichment \n \nStakeholders identified nutrients in runoff as an issue of concern. Stakeholders also \nexpressed concern about the costs associated with variable-rate fertilizer applications \n(i.e., precision agriculture). MDEQ has determined that there is a high probability that nutrient \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcentrations in Upper Porter Bayou are at levels that can create conditions harmful to fish and other \nwildlife. High nutrient concentrations can support unusually high growth of algae or other \naquatic plants. When the algae die, their decomposition uses oxygen from the water, which can \nresult in low oxygen levels that are harmful to fish and other aquatic life. The TMDL for Porter \nBayou recommends reduction of total phosphorus loads by around 95%, and reductions of total \nnitrogen loads by about 84% (MDEQ 2008). \n \n \n \n4.4.1    Locations Where Nutrient Enrichment is an Issue \nMDEQ has identified Upper Porter Bayou as not supporting its designated use of aquatic  \nlife support due to nutrient enrichment. \n \n \n \n4.4.2    Cause \nNitrogen and phosphorus are the pollutants that are suspected of causing eutrophic \nconditions in these water bodies with high productivity and low dissolved oxygen levels. Total \nnitrogen and total phosphorus are the nutrient species addressed in the TMDL (MDEQ 2008). \n \n \n \n4.4.3    Source \nNutrient loads are contributed by point sources and nonpoint sources in the watershed. \n \n \n \n4.4.3.1 Point Source \n \nThe Shaw POTW (MS0024953) permit is for the discharge of treated domestic \nwastewater (i.e., sewage). The NPDES permit for the Shaw POTW includes limits for ammonia, \ntotal nitrogen, and total phosphorus that will go into effect in 2013 at the latest. These limits are \nsummarized in Table 4.1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  4\n\nParameter \nMaximum monthly \naverage load \n(lb/day) \nMaximum daily \nload \n(lb/day) \nMaximum monthly \naverage \nconcentration \n(mg/L) \nMaximum daily \nconcentration \n(mg/L) \nAmmonia N 7.5 11.2 2.48 3.72 \nTotal nitrogen 34.5 69.0 na na \nTotal phosphorus 15.6 31.2 na na \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 4.1. Nutrient limits in the NPDES permit for the Shaw POTW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.4.3.2 Nonpoint Sources \n \nThe Porter Bayou Watershed WASP model indicated that the water quality impairment is \ndue to nutrients from nonpoint sources. In the nutrient TMDL for Porter Bayou, cropland was \nassumed to be the greatest source of total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads (MDEQ 2008). In \naddition, the majority of nutrient loading to streams typically comes from storm water runoff \n(reference). As noted in Section 2.5, there are approximately 15,748 acres of cropland in the \nUpper Porter Bayou watershed. \nTotal nitrogen is a combination of many forms of nitrogen found in the environment. \nInorganic nitrogen can be transported in particulate and dissolved phases in surface runoff. \nDissolved inorganic nitrogen can be transported in groundwater and may enter a water body \nfrom groundwater infiltration. Finally, atmospheric gaseous nitrogen may enter a water body \nfrom\n atmospheric deposition (MDEQ 2008). \nPhosphorus is primarily transported in surface runoff when it has been sorbed by eroding \nsediment. Phosphorus may also be associated with fine-grained particulate matter in the \natmosphere and can enter streams as a result of dry fallout and rainfall (EPA 1999). Phosphorus \ncontained in the surface runoff due to fertilizers and animal excrement or watersheds with \nnaturally occurring soils that are rich in phosphorus (Thomann and Mueller, 1987). Watersheds \nwith a large number of failing septic tanks may also deliver significant loadings of phosphorus to \na water body (MDEQ 2008). Water in the Mississippi Alluvial Aquifer (located under Porter \nBayou watershed) is known to have a relatively high concentration of phosphorus. Therefore \nphosphorus can also enter surface waters from ground water seeps or discharges. USGS has an \non-going sampling program to quantify phosphorus in groundwater in the Delta. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.5    Organic Enrichment and Low DO \n \nThe presence of high levels of organic material in water bodies can reduce water oxygen \nlevels such that aquatic life cannot be supported. The TMDL addressing this impairment states \nthat reducing nutrient loads is expected to reduce organic enrichment and low dissolved oxygen \nconditions (MDEQ 2008). Therefore, no reduction is specified in the TMDL for organic material \n(TBODu). \n \n \n \n4.5.1    Locations Where Organic Enrichment and Low DO are Issues \nMDEQ has identified Upper Porter Bayou as not supporting its designated use of aquatic  \nlife support due to organic enrichment and low dissolved oxygen. \n \n \n \n4.5.2    Cause \nThe nutrient TMDL assumed that nutrient enrichment was the cause of the organic \nenrichment and low dissolved oxygen conditions. As described in Section 4.2, high nutrient \nconcentrations in a water body can encourage the growth of aquatic plants, which can encourage \nthe growth of aquatic animals, all of which becomes organic material when it dies, and removes \noxygen from the water as it decomposes. High levels of organic material decomposing in a water \nbody deplete oxygen from the water and suffocate aquatic life. \n \n \n \n4.5.3    Sources \nWhile nutrient enrichment is believed to be the primary cause of organic enrichment and \nlow dissolved oxygen conditions cited for Porter Bayou, there are potential sources of organic \nmaterial in the watershed that may also contribute to these conditions. They are discussed below. \nSee Section 4.4.3 for a discussion of nutrient sources in the Porter Bayou watershed. \n \n \n \n4.5.3.1 Point Sources \n \nThe Shaw POTW (MS0024953) permit is for the discharge of treated domestic \nwastewater (i.e., sewage). The NPDES permit for the Shaw POTW includes limits for oxygen \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  6\n\nParameter \nMaximum \nmonthly \naverage load \n(lb/day) \nMaximum daily \nload \n(lb/day) \nMaximum \nmonthly \naverage \nconcentration \n(mg/L) \nMaximum daily \nconcentration \n(mg/L) \nMinimum daily \nconcentration \n(mg/L) \nDissolved \nOxygen \nna na na na 6 \nBOD5 90 135 30 45 na \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndemand and dissolved oxygen that will be effective no later than 2013 (Table 4.2).

Oxygen-related NPDES permit limits for Shaw POTW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.5.3.2 Nonpoint Sources \n \nOrganic material, such as crop residue, leaves, and chaff, can be washed into the water \nbody from the surrounding land, and exert an oxygen demand as they decompose. Sources can \nalso include plants along the stream banks. \n \n \n \n \n4.6    Pesticides \n \nA fish consumption advisory is in effect for long-lived pesticides in selected fish species \nthat covers all Delta streams and lakes, including those in the Upper Porter Bayou watershed (see \nSection 2.6.2.4). Pesticide concentrations in soils, surface water or groundwater have not been \nidentified as a health concern. \nStakeholders identified herbicide-resistant weeds as an issue in the watershed. New \nherbicide combinations are being developed to control these weeds. \n \n \n \n4.6.1    Locations Where Pesticides are an Issue \nLegacy pesticides in fish are an issue for all Delta water bodies, including Porter Bayou \nand all other water bodies in the watershed. Herbicide-resistant weeds occur throughout the \nwatershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.6.2    Causes \nDDT and Toxaphene are the pesticides named in the Delta-wide fish consumption \nadvisory. These pesticides degrade very slowly in the environment and are bioaccumulative, \nmeaning they accumulate in living tissue and can be passed on to other organisms, including \nhumans, through the food chain. Eventually, these pesticides can accumulate in certain fish \nspecies to the point that eating those fish can cause health problems in people. DDT and \nToxaphene have been measured in fish tissue throughout the Delta at levels that may harm \nhuman health. \n \n \n \n4.6.3    Sources \nDDT and Toxaphene are no longer used in the US. The use of DDT was banned in the \nUS in 1973, and use of Toxaphene was banned in 1982. Historically, however, DDT and \nToxaphene were commonly used on croplands in the Delta, including the 15,748 acres of \ncropland in the Upper Porter Bayou watershed. Because it takes decades for these chemicals to \ndegrade, t hey are still found in soils, sediments, and living organisms in the Delta. Recent \nmeasurement of concentrations of DDT and Toxaph\n\nene in fish tissue collected from the Delta \nindicate that concentrations of these pesticides are decreasing (MDEQ 2001). This suggests that \nthe residual DDT and Toxaphene is finally degrading. Prolonged extensive use of glyphosate as \na herbicide in the watershed has resulted in natural selection for glyphosate resistance in weeds. \nFarm equipment may facilitate transfer of resistant weed seeds among fields. \n \n \n4.7    Aquatic Weeds \n \n Stakeholders identified alligator weed as a problem in the watershed, primarily due to \nreductions in drainage capacity and loss of habitat diversity.  Alligator weed is the object of an \non-going NPBDD eradication program. \n \n 4.7.1    Locations \n \n Alligator weed is present throughout Lower Porter Bayou, however the heaviest \ninfestations are found within approximately 10 miles upstream and 10 miles downstream of \nShaw, Ms. \n \n \n \n4-  8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.7.2    Causes \n \nStream sedimentation has resulted in shallow water conditions throughout Porter Bayou. \nDuring the growing season, shallow, warm water with loose sediments beneath is an excellent \nmedium for the establishment and growth of alligator weed. High growth rates exhibited by the \nplant give it a competitive advantage against native vegetation which has resulted in dense mats \nof monotypic alligator weed throughout the waterway. \n \n \n \n \n4.7.3    Sources \n \n \n While the exact source is difficult to determine, alligator weed is a non-native invasive \nplant that was likely introduced to the watershed through animal or water transfer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  9\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5.0 RESTORATION AND PROTECTION GOALS \n \n \n \n5.1 Water Quality  \n \n The restoration and protection goals for the Upper Porter Bayou Watershed are based, in \npart, on the goal of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy; which is answering the following \nquestions: \n \n1.     What percent reduction of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loading is possible? \n2.     What do the sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus load reductions cost? \n3.     What are the benefits of these load reductions for stakeholders? \n4.      What nutrient load reductions will protect Delta water quality and the Gulf of Mexico? \n \n5.2 Water Quantity  \n \n The restoration and protection goals for the Upper Porter Bayou Watershed are also \nbased partly on the  goals of the Mississippi Sustainable Resources Task Force, some of which \ninclude the following questions:  \n \n1.     How much groundwater recharge is possible in the watershed? \n2.      How much groundwater savings can be achieved with voluntary conservation measures? \n3.      How much groundwater savings can be achieved through the development and use of \nsurface water resources in the watershed? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6.0 TARGETING AND PRIORITIZATION \n \n \n BMPs are will be implemented in the Upper Porter Bayou watershed through several \nprojects. The prioritization and targeting processes used for these projects are described below. \n \n \n6.1    Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy \n \n Nutrient loading in agricultural effluent varies by region, watershed, and individual field. \nThe nutrient cycle in an agricultural watershed is an extremely complex system with many inputs \nand variables. To fully address the issue, a comprehensive approach must be used to ensure that \nall factors are considered. As part of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy, the Site \nCharacterization Work Group was tasked with developing a strategy to prioritize agricultural \nsystems for nutrient reduction. \n Using this strategy, systems within the Upper Porter Bayou Watershed were classified \nbased on soil type, cropping practices, and existing drainage infrastructure. Soils can be \ndescribed as heavy (clays), medium (loams) light (sandy loams), and mixed (clay, loam, and \nsandy loams found in close proximity due to ridge and swale topography). Cropping practices \nwere initially classified as irrigated or dry land, then by soybeans, rice/soybean rotation, cotton, \nor corn. Drainage infrastructure can be classified as developed or undeveloped. Developed land \ntypically consists of leveled or precision graded fields with pipes, pads, and tailwater ditches, or \nridge and swale land that has been shaped to facilitate furrow irrigation. Undeveloped land \nincludes areas with significant ridge and swale and/or subject to frequent flooding. These areas \nare not developed because the development cost exceeds potential benefits. \nProject sites within the Upper Porter Bayou Watershed may be selected for \nimplementation of nutrient reduction BMPs (Figure 6.1). These proposed sites are characteristic \nof systems that are representative of the agricultural landscape throughout the Lower Porter \nBayou watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6.2    Mississippi River Basin Initiative Cooperative Conservation Partnership \nInitiative \n \nSite's with active or planned water quality monitoring will be given priority to \nreceive funds to implement BMPs under the Mississippi River Basin Initiative Cooperation \nConservation Partnership Initiative (MRBI-CCPI) program.

Ranking criteria for high priority restoration and enhancement \nprojects, developed by DW and MDWFP, include factors such as location, riparian buffers, water \navailability, proximity to other waterfowl habitat, and connectivity with surrounding habitat.

Alligator weed is selectively managed against to promote the re-growth of native \nwetland plants. While the floodway is primarily dominated by a cypress/tupelo tree canopy, the \nNPBDD manages the understory vegetation for desirable herbaceous wetland plants, which \nprovides significant improvements to water quality in the watershed.  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6-  4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.0 MANAGEMENT \n \nThere are two underlying management principles of this WIP: ecosystem-based \nmanagement and adaptive management. The goals and objectives of this plan reflect these \nprinciples. Each of these management principles is briefly described below, followed by \nwatershed management actions that are planned for the near future to work toward the vision for \nPorter Bayou. Goals related to other existing or potential concerns in this watershed will be \naddressed in future implementation plans. \n \n \n \n7.1    Ecosystem-Based Management \n \nAn ecosystem-based approach is being used for watershed management in the Upper Porter \nBayou watershed. Porter Bayou and its watershed represent the ecosystem management unit. \nAlthough bayous and lakes are typically considered the ecosystem, water bodies and their \nwatershed are inexorably coupled. Land use and land cover activities in the watershed directly or \nindirectly affect the water body. Sediment and nutrient loadings from the watershed drive many \naquatic ecosystem processes, including both desirable and undesirable changes in the water \nbody. The ecosystem, however, is characterized not only by its environmental attributes, but also \nby its socioeconomic attributes. Humans are part of, not apart from, aquatic ecosystems. \nWatershed management is fundamentally a social activity (Thornton and Creager 2001). \nThe benefits that accrue from reduced sediment and nutrient loadings to Upper Porter Bayou are \nnot just in terms of increased water clarity, reduced sedimentation, reduced algal blooms, a more \nproductive sport fishery, and greater recreational and aesthetic values. The agricultural \ncommunity also benefits from reduced sediment and nutrient loadings. For example, Pimentel et \nal. (1995) estimated that each ton of sediment lost was worth about $6.75 per year to the farmer \n($5.00 per ton for lost nutrients, and $1.75 per ton for lost soil and water capacity). The Delta \nsediment TMDL estimates that at least 0.007 tons per acre per day of sediment is lost. Based on \nthis loss rate, just over approximately 40,600 tons of soil are lost from the Porter Bayou \nwatershed each year (15,896 acres x 0.007 x 365), and the minimum estimate of dollars lost from \nthe watershed is about $274,050 per year. This is equivalent to approximately $203,000  in lost \nnutrients from the watershed and approximately $71,050 in lost sediment and water capacity. \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese estimates are very conservative because they are based on yield from the watershed, not \nloss from the fields (field losses are higher than delivery to the waterbody). \n \n \n \n7.2    Adaptive Management Process \n \nIn addition to ecosystem-based management, an adaptive management process is being \nused for watershed management in the Upper Porter Bayou watershed. Adaptive management is \n“learning by doing” and has become the recommended approach for ecosystem and natural \nresources management, including watershed management (Christensen et al. 1996; Holling 1978; \nJackson et al. 2001). Adaptive management has helped shift management from the concept that \nthere is a “balance of nature” to a more realistic concept that ecosystems are dynamic, \nnon-equilibrium systems. The environment is continually changing climate, development, \nagricultural practices, demographics, and societal values. Adaptive management is the only \nfeasible approach for moving toward sustainable water resources (Coleman 1998). \nAdaptive management, or learning by doing, means that periodic assessments must be \nmade to determine if results-based criteria are being attained and if the water bodies and \nwatershed are moving toward the desired vision for Porter Bayou and its watershed. The \nschedule for these periodic assessments and revision of the watershed management plan is \ndiscussed in Chapters 9 and 10. The rotating basin approach used by MDEQ is part of this \nperiodic assessment process. \n \n \n \n7.3    Planned activities \n \nThere are two key factors in this watershed that dictate which BMPs will be successful, \nirrigation and development. With development comes an increased financial investment by the \nlandowner. As land cost increases, landowner willingness to take land out of production to \nimplement BMPs decreases. This scenario calls for larger BMPs to be implemented in \nundeveloped areas that will treat runoff from upstream, developed areas. The less developed \nareas of the watershed are characterized by ridge and swale topography and there are more \nopportunities for BMP implementation. Low-lying swales are suitable for treatment wetlands, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhile unimproved drainage ditches are prime candidates for low grade weirs, tail water recovery \nsystems, and other BMPs. \nIrrigation, particularly of rice, introduces an additional factor into the nutrient equation. \nBase flows in most Delta streams naturally decrease during the summer months due to less \nrainfall. Irrigation water supplements these base flows and often provides a constant source of \nrunoff throughout the growing season. Although increased base flows benefit many aspects of \nstream health and water quality, it also reduces the ability of some BMPs to trap nutrients. For \nexample, multiple low grade weirs are designed to trap and pool runoff allowing biological \ntransformations to occur. With a steady base flow the utility of these in-stream BMPs is greatly \ndiminished. To effectively treat this type of runoff we must focus on BMPs capable of treating or \nreusing large volumes of water. Therefore, for areas of the watershed characterized by both \ndevelopment and irrigation, tail water recovery systems, on-farm storage reservoirs, and \ntreatment wetlands. \nGiven these considerations, the management practices currently targeted for the Porter \nBayou watershed include \n \n \n• Nutrient and sediment BMPs, \n• Enroll marginal lands in wetland restoration programs, \n• Water management projects, \n• Wildlife management, \n• Point source management, \n• Riparian buffer restoration, and \n• Alligator weed control.  \n  \n \n7.3.1    Nutrient and Sediment BMPs \nUpper Porter Bayou has been targeted for monitoring and installation of BMPs to reduce \n nutrient and sediment loads in cropland runoff. Specific nutrient and sediment BMPs that may \nbe installed in the watershed include: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n• Low-grade weirs, \n• Pads and pipes, \n• Irrigation tailwater recovery systems, \n• Irrigation water conveyance pipe, \n• Irrigation land leveling, \n• Water control structures, \n• Two stage ditches, \n• Grassed waterways, \n• Riparian buffers, \n• Input management, and \n• Conservation easements. \n \n \n \nThese BMPs are discussed below, and a map of potential locations can be found as Figure 1. \n \n \n \n7.3.1.1 Low-grade Weirs \n \nInstallation of low-grade weirs in agricultural drainage ditches can improve water quality \nthrough removal of sediment and nutrients. The weirs slow flow during storm events and allow \nsediment to be deposited. In addition, holding water in the ditches behind the weirs creates \nenvironments that encourage biogeochemical transformation of nutrients, and may contribute to \ngroundwater recharge (Kroger et al 2008\na\n). One study in the Delta determined that low-grade \nweirs reduced annual phosphorus loads from cropland runoff by over 40% (Kroger et al. 2008\nb\n). \n   Low-grade weirs will be installed in ditches throughout the watershed as funding allows  \n  through various cost share programs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7.1.

The pad (a dike) routes flow through the pipe to provide an non-erodible \nroute for runoff as an alternative to unlined ditches or gullies. This practice has been classified \nby the Mississippi NRCS as having the potential to decrease sediment loads slightly to significantly.\n7\n  \nThis practice is not expected to significantly affect nutrient loads, except for phosphorus associated  \nwith sediment loads.\n8\n Pad and pipe systems have already been installed in Upper Porter Bayou by  \nsome producers in the watershed. However, there is potential for installation in additional locations \nthroughout the watershed (Figure 7.1). These systems could be designed and installed by the landowner, \nwith assistance from Delta F.A.R.M or NRCS. Financial assistance for installation and maintenance of \nthese systems may be provided by through the EPA Section 319 grant funds, NRCS cost share programs, \nor privately funded by the landowner or producer. See Table 7.2 for details of the plans for installing \nthese systems. \n \n \n \n7.3.1.3 Irrigation Tailwater Recovery \n \n   Tailwater recovery systems collect irrigation runoff water for reuse. This makes for more \nefficient use of irrigation water. Holding runoff water, such as in a collection pond, allows sediment  \nto settle out, and creates environments that encourage biogeochemical transformation of nutrients, as  \nwell as contribute to groundwater recharge. In addition to water use management and water quality \nimprovement, tailwater recovery ponds can benefit several of the species of concern identified in  \nSection 3.3. Tailwater recovery systems are planned for the watershed and will be installed where \nsuitable. The systems will be designed to recover drainage from cropland in the  \nwatershed. Systems may be designed and installed by the landowner with assistance from NRCS  \nand Delta F.A.R.M.  Financial assistance for installation of systems may be available from NRCS \nprograms and/or EPA 319 grant funds.

See Table 7.4 for details of the plans for installing \n underground irrigation pipe in the Porter Bayou wa\n\ntershed. \n \n \n7.3.1.5 Irrigation Land Leveling \n \nThis practice involves modifying the shape of the land to planned grades that permit \nuniform and efficient application of irrigation water, reduce erosion and water logging, and provide  \nfor adequate drainage. Land leveling is an eligible practice for the MRBI CCPI and EQIP program.  \nSee Table 7.5 for details of the plans for implementing this practice  in the Upper Porter Bayou \nwatershed.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  8\n\n \n \nT\nable 7.2.

These lands can reduce erosion through stabilizing soil. Conservation lands can also \nact as filters to remove sediment and nutrients in runoff. Conservation programs generally \nprovide some kind of financial incentive or compensation in return for removing the land from \ncultivation, such as rental payments, cost-share for restoration work, or tax credits. The USDA \nmanages several programs for land conservation in Mississippi, including the Conservation \nReserve Program, Conservation Stewardship Program, and Wildlife Habitat Enhancement \nProgram. The Mississippi Fish and Wildlife Foundation also manages a conservation easement \nprogram, as do the Mississippi Land Trust Ducks Unlimited and Delta Wildlife.  \n \n \n   7.3.1.10 Riparian Buffers \n \nRiparian buffers help reduce bank erosion, provide and improve wildlife habitat, and trap \nsediment and nutrients from overland runoff to the waterway. Riparian buffers also serve as \nfilters strips removing sediments from agricultural runoff entering the bayou through overland \nflow.  \n The NPBDD Stream Ban Restoration Project involves the mulching and grinding of \nwoody underbrush along the banks of Porter Bayou. Native warm season grasses have been \nplanted in high topographic areas as a means of bank stabilization and herbaceous wetland plants \nare being managed for in the floodway.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  15\n\n \n \nTable 7.7.

Precision agriculture is expected to reduce the amount of inputs \nproducers use, reducing their production costs, and runoff and infiltration of fertilizer \nnutrients and pesticide chemicals. \n   There is currently concern among Delta producers about the high start-up costs of \nprecision agriculture, and the uncertainty about whether the technique actually increases \nproducer profits. There is also uncertainty among producers about how to implement the \ntechniques, and if it is even needed in the Delta. This technique was developed in the upper \nMidwest, which has very different soils and nutrient cycling than the Delta. Table 7.8 contains  \nadditional information. \n \n7.3.2    Enroll Lands in Wetland Reserve Program \nNatural and constructed wetlands have been shown to improve water quality through \nremoval of sediment and nutrients. Slow flow through the wetlands allows sediments to be \ndeposited. Nutrients are used by wetland plants, and the wet environment encourages \nbiogeochemical transformation of nutrients. In addition, wetlands can be places of groundwater \nrecharge. \nPorter Bayou watershed is a target watershed under the MRBI Wetland Reserve \nEnhancement Program (WREP). Approximately 6,007 acres of wetlands currently exist in the \nPorter Bayou watershed (Figure 2.2). There are already a few wetland easements in the \nwatershed. Delta Wildlife and Mississippi NRCS will assist with design of constructed wetlands.  \nSee Table 7.9 for additional information about wetland restoration and construction activities  \nplanned for Porter Bayou watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  17 \n \n \n \n \n\n7.3.3   Wildlife Management \nProjects may be implemented in the Porter Bayou watershed with the purpose of \nimproving and extending habitat for wildlife, primarily birds. These include restoration, creation, \nand management of wetlands through the Wetland Reserve Program and WREP, and shallow \nwater development and management. Restored and constructed wetlands can provide wintering \nhabitat, migratory stop-over sites, late summer/fall foraging sites, and breeding/nesting habitat \nfor a number of waterfowl, forest, and migratory bird species. Shallow water development and \nmanagement involves inundating fields during the winter to provide habitat for wildlife, \nincluding native and migrating waterfowl, migrating shorebirds, amphibians, and fish. As noted \nin Section 7.3.2, wetland restoration, construction, and management activities in Upper Porter Bayou \nare eligible for assistance under the MRBI. See Table 7.10 for additional information. \nOther management practices also have the potential to improve or extend habitat for \nwildlife. Tailwater recovery ponds (Section 7.3.1.3) and off-channel storage ponds \n(Section 7.3.5.2) can provide habitat for waterfowl and amphibians. Riparian buffers \n(Section 7.3.1.9) can improve fisheries of the associated waterway, and provide habitat for \nterrestrial wildlife, including birds. \n \n \n \n \n \n7.3.4    Alligator Weed Control \nThe existing NPBDD eradication program will be continued as adequate funds are available. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  18 \n \n\nTable 7\n.8 Precision Agriculture and Input Management\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  19\n\nTable 7\n.9.

Development of off-channel water storage is an eligible \npractice under the MRBI-CCPI, AWEP and EQIP programs. Landowners will design and install off-\nchannel water storage with assistance from NRCS and Delta F.A.R.M. Priority locations for off-channel \nwater storage will be determined based on program prioritization criteria (Section 6.2). See Table 7.11  \nfor additional information on installation of off-channel storage in the Upper Porter Bayou watershed. \n \n \n \n7.3.5.3 Dikes \n \nDikes are embankments, usually constructed of earth, for the purpose of protecting land \nfrom flooding, or otherwise controlling water.

This may include implementation of the NRCS PHAUCET Irrigation Control \nProgram. This program helps producers design flat poly pipe furrow irrigation systems by identifying  \nthe appropriate hole sizes to punch in the pipe based on variables such as the well pump rate, field \nslope, row lengths, and size of poly pipe (YMD 2009). This design assistance is expected to reduce  \nwater usage. Feedback from producers who have used PHAUCET has all been positive (YMD 2009).  \nSee Table 7.12 for additional information on planned implementation of irrigation water management  \nin Upper Porter Bayou watershed. \n \n  \n   7.3.6    Point Source Management \nThe Shaw POTW will be required to achieve NPDES permit limits for ammonia in its \neffluent by May 2013. As a condition of its NPDES permit, the Shaw POTW was required to \nsubmit an engineering report to MDEQ describing how the facility would come into compliance \nwith the appropriate ammonia limit, by May 2011.

These \nstakeholders were also apprised of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy, and the associated \nwork planned in the Porter Bayou watershed. \n \n \n8.2.2    Nutrient and Sediment BMPs \nThe data gathered from the monitoring associated with BMP installations in Upper Porter  \nBayou watershed will be used to inform producers in the area, and the BMP sites will be \nincluded on informative tours for Delta farmers. Prewitt Farms lies in the Upper Porter Bayou \nwatershed and currently serves as a demonstration farm where BMPs are showcased during the \nnumerous farm tours that are held each year. \n \n \n8.2.3   PHAUCET \n Mississippi State University, Delta F.A.R.M., NRCS and the YMD Water Management District \nwork to inform producers in the watershed about the PHAUCET program, its benefits and success, and \nhow to implement it. \n \n \n \n \n \n8-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n8.2.4    WRP Enrollment \n \n   The most effective outreach efforts are those that work one on one with individual \nlandowners, which is the process that will be used by both DW and NRCS in implementing \nthe WRP. NRCS will work with individual landowners first, to enroll land in WRP \nand draw up contracts for wetland easements. Once the contracts are signed, DW and NRCS will \ninclude the landowners in designing and constructing the WRP project, to ensure compatibility \nwith farming practices, and provide insight and information on how wetland functions benefit the \nlandowner. Ancillary benefits the landowner receives by having the WRP project on their \nproperty will be described and documented for use in future DW outreach and education. \n   Sustaining both the wetland functions and management activities over time will be \nsignificantly enhanced with three years of individual landowner outreach on wetland \nmanagement. After three years, the wetlands will be established and close to being self- \nsustaining. Further, after 3 years of individual consultation and encouragement, landowner \nmanagement activities are expected to become part of their routine farming practices. \n \n \n8.3   Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy \n \n Ongoing activities associated with Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy are expected to contribute to \nthe awareness, education, and outreach goals of this plan. DNRS work groups routinely meet to discuss \nmonitoring, best management practices, water management, input management, etc.  Outcomes from these \nmeetings are incorporated into education/outreach materials which are disseminated to producers and the \ngeneral public through multiple outlets. \n \n8.4    Schedule \n \nActivities geared toward increasing awareness, outreach, and education will occur \nthroughout the process of contracting, designing, installing, maintaining, and documenting \nmanagement practices in the Upper Porter Bayou watershed. A schedule will be developed as funds are \n made available but implementation could potentially begin in 2014. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8-  2 \n \n \n \n \n\n \n   \n    \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n   \n   \n \n  \n                                      \n                                       \n                                \n            \n                                   \n \n \n                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  8.5    Budget \n \nAwareness, outreach, and education activities planned in Porter Bayou watershed will be \nfunded through grants and agency operations budgets.

Current efforts by MDEQ, \nUSGS, and MSU are monitoring flow, sediment, N, and P, and other constituents during both base flow  \nand storm flow, prior to, and after, construction and implementation of conservation management practices  \nto determine the resulting percent reduction in sediment, N, and P at the multiple spatial tiers.  However, \nfunding for these efforts is set to expire in 2014. See Figure 7.1 for monitoring locations. \n \n \n \n9.1.2    Habitat \n WRP Easement properties in the watershed are monitored by NRCS or a technical service \n provider such as Delta Wildlife.  Site conditions are documented and reported to NRCS who \n maintains the records for each easement property. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9.1.3    Water Levels \nGround water levels in Upper Porter Bayou watershed are routinely monitored at selected wells \nby YMD. YMD surveys water levels in 550 wells throughout the Delta every year in the spring \nand fall (YMD 2008). There are no USGS continuous ground water monitoring wells located in \nthe Porter Bayou watershed.\n9\n \nSurface water levels do not appear to be routinely monitored at any water body in the \nPorter Bayou watershed. Water levels in the Sunflower River are monitored by a USGS gage \nupstream of Porter Bayou, at Sunflower.\n10\n \n \n \n \n9.1.4    Water Use Survey \nYMD conducts an annual water use survey for the five major crop types in the Delta – \ncorn, cotton, soybeans, rice, and catfish. Between 100 and 150 sites are surveyed each year. \nIrrigation water volumes are estimated based on pump flow rate and monthly electricity usage. \n \n \n \n9.1.5    Schedule \n \n   The schedule for monitoring activities well be developed as funding sources are made available. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  9 http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ms/nwis/gw \n10 http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ms/nwis/dv/?site_no=07288500&amp;referred_module=sw \n \n \n \n9-  2\n\nMonitoring Activity Budget Funding Source \nWater quality \n$180,000 (3 years) \nEPA/DEQ/USGS \nWetland habitat agency budgets NRCS \nGround water levels agency budget YMD \nWater use agency budget YMD \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9.1.6    Budget \nBudget information for monitoring activities is summarized in Table 9.2. \n \n \n \n  Table 9.2.

The nutrient TMDL completed for Porter Bayou used preliminary annual average \nconcentration targets of 1.05 mg/l for TN and 0.16 mg/l for TP (MDEQ 2008). The management \ntargets for this plan are 40% reduction of TN load to Porter Bayou, and 50% reduction of the TP \nload to Porter Bayou. \n \n \n \n9.2.2    Sediment \nSimon et al (2000) developed acceptable ranges of sediment loadings at the effective \ndischarge of Mississippi water bodies from suspended sediment concentration (SSC) data \nmeasured at stable streams in the same ecoregion. The effective discharge is the discharge which \nmoves the most sediment, or is the channel-forming flow. The target range for the water bodies \nwithin the Yazoo River basin (which includes Upper Porter Bayou) is 0.0014 to 0.0045 tons per acre \nper day at the effective discharge.  \n \n \n \n9.2.3 Groundwater \nFor activities focused on reducing groundwater use, the management target is to reduce \ngroundwater use by 40 acre-feet per year at the site of implementation. Restoration of wetlands \nalso has a target of increasing the area available for groundwater recharge in the Porter Bayou \nwatershed by 3 acres. \n \n9.3    Assessment \n \nImplementation milestones and schedules have been or will be developed for the management \nactions and education and outreach activities described in this plan. For implementation to be \nconsidered successful, all activity milestones must be met on time. Once the project is initiated,  \nthe Team will meet quarterly to review progress on achieving the milestones and make needed  \nadjustments to the schedule. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9-  4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach Team member serves as the chair for one of the major management categories, such as \nsewerage, sediment and nutrient loading, etc. There is a subcommittee associated with each of \nthese categories to ensure that the management actions are implemented. \nIn addition, the success of the implementation of this plan in achieving the management \ntargets specified in Section 9.2, will be evaluated no later than 2020. This will be accomplished \nby the Watershed Implementation Team, or its designee(s), compiling and renewing available \nmonitoring data (Section 9.1) and comparing results to the targets. A short report will be \nprepared by the evaluators, summarizing the results of their review. This information will be \nprovided to all interested stakeholders and implementation participants in preparation for \nrevising the Upper Porter Bayou Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). \n \n \n \n9.3.1    Plan \nSpecific management action schedules toward achieving the vision for the Upper Porter Bayou \nwatershed are described in Chapter 7.0 and summarized in Table 7.14. If the schedules are not \nbeing met, the causes behind the failure to meet the goals will be determined, and actions will be \ntaken. Specific management action goals and/or expectations are described in Chapter 7.0. \n \n \n \n9.3.2    Education and outreach \nSpecific goals and/or expectations for education and outreach activities are described in \nChapter 8.0. If the activity goals were not met, the causes behind the failure to meet the goals \nwill be determined. In addition, the plan activities will be evaluated with regard to information \nand knowledge about the watershed and its waterbodies that has been gained since the existing \nplan was developed, as well as any relevant physical changes in the watershed or changes in \npolicy affecting the watershed. Implementation of the activities will be reevaluated in light of all \nof this information on a quarterly basis, as discussed above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9-  5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.0 Overall Budget  \n \n \nTable 10.1 Watershed Implementation Plan Budget \nActivity NRCS EPA 319 Producer Other Total \nBMPs  $  3,699,575   $  2,830,700   $  3,105,425   $           -     $  9,635,700  \nMonitoring  $                 -     $        90,000   $                 -     $  90,000   $     180,000  \nOutreach  $        30,000   $        45,000   $                 -     $  30,000   $     105,000  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n10-1 \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11.0 PLAN REVISION \n \n \n   Dependent on approval and funding, the Watershed Implementation Team will prepare a \n revised WIP, incorporating the changes requested by the reviewers and reconciling any conflicting \ncomments or requests for change. \n   The WIP will be submitted to the Watershed Implementation Team and all others \nwho submitted comments.
