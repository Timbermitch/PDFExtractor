The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3. BMP locations in the Steele Bayou Watershed. \n \n \n \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for implementing practices that address sedimentation and siltation can be \nfound in Table 4. \n\n 17 \n \nTable 4.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.

In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f. Fisheries Management.  MDWFP will continue to \nmonitor the fishery for changes due to the invasion of silver \ncarp and take action if a solution is found. \n \nTable 1 \nStructures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \nOverfall Pipes (39 units minimum) \nWater diversion pads (1000 feet minimum) \nBank Stabilization ( 4 minimum) \nRip-rap weirs ( 5 minimum) \n \nPage 15 \nAg BMP $3,803456 \nNoxious Aquatics $27,350 \nFisheries Management $185,148 \nTOTAL $4,015,954 \nTables 4, 5, 6 \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Steele \nBayou watershed is to develop an atmosphere that promotes \nsustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. \nPage 20 \nImplementation will be dependent on the cooperation of the \nprivate landowners. \nPage 14 \nUSGS will conduct water quality monitoring plan.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f. Fisheries Management.  MDWFP will continue to \nmonitor the fishery for changes due to the invasion of silver \ncarp and take action if a solution is found. \n \nTable 1 \nStructures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \nOverfall Pipes (39 units minimum) \nWater diversion pads (1000 feet minimum) \nBank Stabilization ( 4 minimum) \nRip-rap weirs ( 5 minimum) \n \nPage 15 \nAg BMP $3,803456 \nNoxious Aquatics $27,350 \nFisheries Management $185,148 \nTOTAL $4,015,954 \nTables 4, 5, 6 \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Steele \nBayou watershed is to develop an atmosphere that promotes \nsustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. \nPage 20 \nImplementation will be dependent on the cooperation of the \nprivate landowners. \nPage 14 \nUSGS will conduct water quality monitoring plan.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f. Fisheries Management.  MDWFP will continue to \nmonitor the fishery for changes due to the invasion of silver \ncarp and take action if a solution is found. \n \nTable 1 \nStructures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \nOverfall Pipes (39 units minimum) \nWater diversion pads (1000 feet minimum) \nBank Stabilization ( 4 minimum) \nRip-rap weirs ( 5 minimum) \n \nPage 15 \nAg BMP $3,803456 \nNoxious Aquatics $27,350 \nFisheries Management $185,148 \nTOTAL $4,015,954 \nTables 4, 5, 6 \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Steele \nBayou watershed is to develop an atmosphere that promotes \nsustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. \nPage 20 \nImplementation will be dependent on the cooperation of the \nprivate landowners. \nPage 14 \nUSGS will conduct water quality monitoring plan.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f. Fisheries Management.  MDWFP will continue to \nmonitor the fishery for changes due to the invasion of silver \ncarp and take action if a solution is found. \n \nTable 1 \nStructures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \nOverfall Pipes (39 units minimum) \nWater diversion pads (1000 feet minimum) \nBank Stabilization ( 4 minimum) \nRip-rap weirs ( 5 minimum) \n \nPage 15 \nAg BMP $3,803456 \nNoxious Aquatics $27,350 \nFisheries Management $185,148 \nTOTAL $4,015,954 \nTables 4, 5, 6 \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Steele \nBayou watershed is to develop an atmosphere that promotes \nsustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. \nPage 20 \nImplementation will be dependent on the cooperation of the \nprivate landowners. \nPage 14 \nUSGS will conduct water quality monitoring plan.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f. Fisheries Management.  MDWFP will continue to \nmonitor the fishery for changes due to the invasion of silver \ncarp and take action if a solution is found. \n \nTable 1 \nStructures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \nOverfall Pipes (39 units minimum) \nWater diversion pads (1000 feet minimum) \nBank Stabilization ( 4 minimum) \nRip-rap weirs ( 5 minimum) \n \nPage 15 \nAg BMP $3,803456 \nNoxious Aquatics $27,350 \nFisheries Management $185,148 \nTOTAL $4,015,954 \nTables 4, 5, 6 \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Steele \nBayou watershed is to develop an atmosphere that promotes \nsustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. \nPage 20 \nImplementation will be dependent on the cooperation of the \nprivate landowners. \nPage 14 \nUSGS will conduct water quality monitoring plan.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f. Fisheries Management.  MDWFP will continue to \nmonitor the fishery for changes due to the invasion of silver \ncarp and take action if a solution is found. \n \nTable 1 \nStructures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \nOverfall Pipes (39 units minimum) \nWater diversion pads (1000 feet minimum) \nBank Stabilization ( 4 minimum) \nRip-rap weirs ( 5 minimum) \n \nPage 15 \nAg BMP $3,803456 \nNoxious Aquatics $27,350 \nFisheries Management $185,148 \nTOTAL $4,015,954 \nTables 4, 5, 6 \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Steele \nBayou watershed is to develop an atmosphere that promotes \nsustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. \nPage 20 \nImplementation will be dependent on the cooperation of the \nprivate landowners. \nPage 14 \nUSGS will conduct water quality monitoring plan.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f. Fisheries Management.  MDWFP will continue to \nmonitor the fishery for changes due to the invasion of silver \ncarp and take action if a solution is found. \n \nTable 1 \nStructures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \nOverfall Pipes (39 units minimum) \nWater diversion pads (1000 feet minimum) \nBank Stabilization ( 4 minimum) \nRip-rap weirs ( 5 minimum) \n \nPage 15 \nAg BMP $3,803456 \nNoxious Aquatics $27,350 \nFisheries Management $185,148 \nTOTAL $4,015,954 \nTables 4, 5, 6 \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Steele \nBayou watershed is to develop an atmosphere that promotes \nsustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. \nPage 20 \nImplementation will be dependent on the cooperation of the \nprivate landowners. \nPage 14 \nUSGS will conduct water quality monitoring plan.

The \nimplementation of this plan also partially fulfills the mission of all members of the Steele \nBayou WIT including: Delta F.A.R.M., Delta Wildlife, Inc.,  Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, United States Army Corp of Engineers, U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, \nMississippi Levee Board, Mississippi Lower Delta Partnership,  Mississippi State \nUniversity, Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District, and all other \npartnering agencies, private landowners, farmers, and business owners in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \nSteele Bayou Watershed Description \n \nSteele Bayou drains approximately 202,617 acres of the Yazoo River basin in portions of \nWashington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren counties in west central Mississippi \n(MDEQ 2003a). We estimate that approximately 4,202 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 data for Washington, Issaquena, Sharkey, and Warren \nCounties obtained from MARIS). The towns of Cary and Mayersville are in the Steele \nBayou watershed and in 1993 land use was primarily agricultural (71.5%) and forestland \n(16.5%) (MDEQ 2003a). Crops produced in the watershed include corn, soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, catfish, rice, and milo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 7 \n \nFigure 1.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the State level. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Location of the Steele Bayou Watershed at the County level. \n \n\n 8 \n \nThe watershed is underlain by Mississippi River alluvium. The topography of the \nwatershed is primarily flat, with the main topographic relief provided by river terraces \n(MDEQ 2000). Commerce-Tunica-Bowdre or Sharkey-Dowling-Tunica soil associations \nare prevalent throughout the watershed.  The watershed is located in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain eco-region. Native vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood \nforest, which includes oak, tupelo gum, cottonwood, and cypress (MARIS).  \n \nSteele Bayou meanders through the southwestern portion of the Mississippi Delta \ndraining agricultural and forestland east of the mainline Mississippi River Levee and west \nof the Deer Creek watershed.  Steele Bayou lies in a natural “sump” or low spot created \nby hundreds of years of floodwaters dropping course textured sediments on the banks of \nDeer Creek and the Mississippi River, thus increasing the elevation of adjacent lands.  \nThe area between these natural “fronts” or “ridges” served as a basin, collecting fine \ntextured sediments and excess floodwaters.  Much of Steele Bayou follows abandoned \nmeanders of the Mississippi River channel created 700 to over 1000 years ago.  As \nforested lands were cleared for agriculture and the need for improved drainage increased, \nthe United State Army Corp of Engineers dredged and re-channelized Steele Bayou \nincreasing the water storage and flow capacity.       \n \nApproximately 10,056 acres of wetlands occur in the watershed. Water levels in the \nBayou are maintained by a series of weirs, the Steele Bayou Control Structure, and the \nshallow Mississippi River alluvial aquifer that underlies the watershed. Ground water \nwithdrawals for agricultural use, primarily irrigation, are made from the alluvial aquifer \nand surface water, with a majority coming from the alluvial aquifer. These withdrawals \nhave resulted in ground water level declines in this aquifer. Deep, confined aquifers are \nthe primary drinking water source in the watershed and are not affected by the alluvial \naquifer. These confined aquifers are generally not susceptible to contamination (MDEQ \n2000). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 9 \nWatershed Implementation Team \n \nFormal members of the Steele Bayou Watershed Implementation Team are listed below \nand represent various professional resource agencies, public and private landowners with \ninterests in the watershed.   \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. and Delta Wildlife, Inc. \n− Trey Cooke, Dan Prevost, Sam Franklin \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n− Pradip Bhowal, Ronn Killebrew, Richard Ingram \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \n− Garry Lucus, Kevin Brunke, Jackie Fleeman, Steven Chandler  \nMississippi State University, College of Forest Resources, Dept. of Wildlife & Fisheries \n− Todd Teitjen, Eric Dibble \nUSDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \n− Phillip Barbour, Mike Oliver \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n− Lloyd Inmon, Bo Olswanger, Mike Yelverton \nU.S. Geological Survey \n− Richard Rebich, Mike Runner \nYazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \n− Dean Pennington \nThe Nature Conservancy \n− Stacey Shankle  \nMississippi Levee Board \n− Peter Nimrod, Bobby Thompson \nMississippi Lower Delta Partnership \n− Meg Cooper \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n− Kenneth Dean  \nUnited States Army Corp of Engineers \n− Dave Johnson, Basil K.

Therefore, the WIT and stakeholders shall only support \nactivities that improve the overall natural resources of the watershed while promoting a \nmore sustainable future for agriculture. \n \nSedimentation and erosion were a common theme among both the WIT and stakeholders.  \nBoth groups recognized that multiple resource concerns would benefit by addressing \nsedimentation and erosion in the watershed.  These concerns included fisheries, irrigation \nwater storage capacity, drainage, and aesthetics.  Other common interests included \nnoxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and alligatorweed \n(Alternanthera philoxeroides), and the overall fisheries condition including advisories for \nlegacy pesticides. \n \nIn addition to sedimentation and erosion, several other concerns were listed by water \nquality resource agencies on the WIT.  These concerns include, low dissolved oxygen, \norganic enrichment, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program identified \n12 threatened or endangered species in the watershed, including the Louisiana Black Bear \n(Ursus Americanus luteolus) and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).  Fisheries \nbiologists were especially concerned with the presence of silver carp \n(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n\n 11 \n \nPriority Concerns \n \nTable 1.

The designated \nbeneficial use for these waters are Aquatic Life Support  (MDEQ 2003).  Table 2 lists the \nnumeric water quality criteria applicable to Steele Bayou watershed perennial surface \nwaters (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 2. Water quality criteria for Steele Bayou watershed. \nParameter Criteria \nDissolved Oxygen 5.0 mg/L daily average, 4.0 mg/L instantaneous \npH Between 6.0 and 9.0 su \nTemperature 32.2 deg C \nFecal coliform May – October: geometric mean of 200 per 100 mL, 400 per \n100 mL less than ten percent (10%) of the time during a 30 \nday period. \nNovember – April: geometric mean of 2000 per 100 mL, \n4000 per 100 mL less than ten percent of the time during a \n30 day period. \nSpecific conductance 1000 uohms/cm \nDissolved Solids 750 mg/L monthly average, 1500 mg/L instantaneous \n \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the \nwaters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely \naffect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated \nuse” (MDEQ 2003). \n \nCurrent Condition \n \nSurface Water Quality \n \nAlthough there is not a routine water quality monitoring station in Steele Bayou \nwatershed, several projects and studies have documented water quality parameters over \nthe years. T he Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers began collecting various sediment \nand nutrient related data in the 1990’s with the implementation of the Upper Steele \nBayou Project.  In January 2007, USEPA published a “Yazoo Basin Water Quality \nModel Parameters Study”.  Many analytical parameters such as suspended sediment, \nnutrients, dissolved oxygen, sediment oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand \nwere recorded along with physical characteristics including channel width/ depth and \nlight penetration (USEPA 2007). \n\n 13 \nGroundwater Resources \n \nThe majority of drinking water use in this watershed is supplied by groundwater from the \ndeep aquifer. The majority of agricultural water use in this watershed is supplied by \ngroundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer. No issues have yet been raised with regard \nto the quality of groundwater in this watershed. Declining groundwater levels in the \nalluvial aquifer are an issue in the watershed (MDEQ 2000). \n \nTMDLs \n \nIn the past, the Steele Bayou watershed has been included on Mississippi 303(d) List.  \nHowever, two total maximum daily load studies (TMDLs) have been completed, one \naddressing sediment/siltation, and one addressing nutrients, thus subsequent removal \nfrom the 2008 303(d) List. \n \nA TMDL addressing sediment/siltation impairment listings for Steele Bayou has been \ncompleted and approved by U.S. EPA (MDEQ 2003a).  However, this TMDL does not \napply to segment MS404E of Steele Bayou of which this plan pertains to.   \n \nA TMDL addressing total nitrogen and total phosphorous for selected large rivers in the \nDelta, including segment MS404E of Steele Bayou, has been completed and approved by \nU.S. EPA (MDEQ 2008). There are currently no numerical criteria for nutrient \nconcentrations in Mississippi surface waters. However, a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) \nunder the direction of MDEQ is working on the development of such criteria.  For water \nbodies on the west side of the Delta, an annual concentration of 1.05 mg/l (total nitrogen) \nand 0.16 mg/l (total phosphorous) are applicable targets.  These are preliminary targets \nand subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria (MDEQ 2008). \n \nFisheries, Plant, and Wildlife Resources \n \nThe only federally endangered species listed by the Mississippi Natural Heritage \nInventory for the Steele Bayou watershed is pondberry, (Lindera melissifolia) in Sharkey \nand Issaquena County.  The only federally threatened species that may occur in the \nSharkey-Issaquena-Warren County portion of the watershed is the Louisiana black bear \n(Ursus americanus luteolus).  These species have the potential to be present in the Steele \nBayou watershed. There are also 10 “state listed” species of concern for Issaquena, \nSharkey, Washington, and Warren counties included in the Natural Heritage Inventory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 14 \n \nTable 3.

The fish \ncovered by the advisory were carp, buffalo, gar, and non-farm raised catfish over 22 \ninches (MDEQ 2001). \n \nThe Steele Bayou Watershed offers numerous opportunities for recreational hunting \nactivities, especially waterfowl hunting.  Two popular Wildlife Management Areas \n(WMA’s) are located in the Watershed, Mahannah and Howard Miller. Both WMA’s are \nintensively managed by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks and \nhold large numbers of waterfowl every winter.  The southern portion of the watershed is \nheavily forested and holds significant populations of consumptive wildlife species such \nas white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, and other small game.     \n \nFishing is only second to hunting as an outdoor recreational activity in the watershed. \nThe lower portion of Steele Bayou holds a fair amount of blue, channel, and flathead \ncatfish. The entire watershed contains abundant populations of rough fish such as gar, \ncarp, and buffalo which provide ample opportunities for bowfisherman. Eagle Lake and \nLake Washington are two very popular oxbow lakes in the lower Steele Bayou \nWatershed known for good bass, catfish, and crappie fishing, as well as recreational \nskiing, tubing, and boating.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 15 \nWatershed Implementation Plan (WIP) \n  \nGoal \n \nThe goals of this watershed implementation plan are geared towards achieving \ncompliance with TMDL’s issued for Steele Bayou.  This can only be accomplished \nthrough the reduction of named pollutants in the watershed.  Ultimately, Steele Bayou \nmust reach and maintain their MDEQ designated use for Fish and Wildlife Support.  \nMany goals of this watershed plan can be achieved through the implementation of \nagricultural BMPs.  Priority Concerns (Table 1) that do not directly identify 303(d) listed \nimpairments or TMDLs in the watershed may also be addressed by this watershed plan \nbecause it is comprehensive in nature.  But it must be noted that these concerns are \nsecondary objectives.  \n \nSediment/Turbidity \n \nParticipants \n      \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks \nUSDA Natural Resource Conservation Service \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \n   \nImplementation/Action \n   \nSilt and soil that choke drainage, stress fisheries, increase turbidity, and decrease water \nholding capacity in Steele Bayou come from adjacent cropland, bank sloughing, and head \ncutting due to flooding.   All causes can be addressed by programs authorized and funded \nthrough the Conservation Title of the Farm Bill.  Programs such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) all provide \nsignificant financial incentives to help landowners address sedimentation issues in Steele \nBayou.  The USDA NRCS and/or FSA administers these programs and also provides \nsignificant technical assistance opportunities to private landowners.  Those landowners \nconcerned about sedimentation in Steele Bayou can often find technical and financial \nassistance by simply contacting their local county USDA Service Center.   \n \nTechnical assistance to address sedimentation in the Steele Bayou Watershed can be \nprovided by Delta F.A.R.M., USACE, USEPA, and MDEQ.  Implementation will be \ndependent on the cooperation of the private landowners. \n \n\n 16 \nIf installed and maintained property, the following Best Management Practices could be \nused to reduce sedimentation by 35% - 67% in the Steele Bayou Watershed. Figure 3 \nmaps the location of these BMP’s within the watershed. \n  \n• Structures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \n• Large Overfall Pipes (39 units) \n• Water Diversion Pads (1000 linear feet minimum) \n• Bank Stabilization (as needed 4 minimum) \n• Rip-Rap weirs (5 units minimum) \n \nFigure 3.

Therefore, the first course of action would be to \nimplement those BMPs listed in the previous section as addressing sediment and \nturbidity. \n \nLow DO levels can also be cause by low flow/shallow waters, algae blooms, and extreme \nwater temperatures.  These issues can be addressed by the installation of low water weirs \nto impound more water during periods of drought.  Furthermore, flows could be \naugmented by other water sources as they have in other Yazoo Basin streams.  MDEQ, \nUSACE, USEPA, USGS, and YMD all have experience in these activities.  Extreme \nwater temperatures can also be mitigated by installing riparian forest buffers near waters \nto provide shading.  The die-off of noxious aquatics may also cause low DO levels in the \nfall.  However, an action plan to address noxious aquatics will be discussed in a later \nsection. \n \n \n \n\n 18 \nHigh Nutrient Levels \n \nParticipants \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Geological Survey (USGS) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nHigh nutrient levels are also attributed to non-point agricultural run-off.  Similar to \nsediment and organic enrichment, nutrients can be significantly reduced by using those \nsame BMPs listed in Table 5.  By implementing these BMPs, nutrients can be reduced by \napproximately 70% (Freedman et al. 2003, Klapproth and Johnson 2000). \n \nFish Advisories \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) \nPrivate Landowners and Farmers \nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nUS Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n     \nImplementation/Action \n   \nFish advisories stem from the persistence and existence of levels of legacy pesticides like \nDDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue.  The USEPA sets tolerance levels for said fish \nadvisories and MDEQ enforces these advisories.  The Fisheries Bureau of MDWFP also \nassists MDEQ with educational processes associated with fish advisories.   \n \nThe goal of this action item is to removal fish consumption advisories for DDT and \nToxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT human health and \naquatic organism standard, and the Toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. The methods \nproposed for achieving these targets included implementation of BMPs to reduce \nsediment loading to water bodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) and natural \nattenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River basin indicate a \ndecreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) (MDEQ \n2003d).  Therefore, those BMPs listed in Table 5 will also serve to achieve this goal. \n \n\n 19 \nNoxious Aquatic Vegetation \n \nParticipants \n   \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife, Inc. \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Transportation \nWashington County Drainage District \nThe Nature Conservancy \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nMississippi State University    \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi State University  \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service  \n    \nImplementation/Action \n   \nWater hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) has been identified as the primary noxious aquatic \nweed found in the Steele Bayou Watershed.  The rapid spread and growth of the aquatic \nplant has caused a great deal of concern among local stakeholders and natural resource \nagencies.  In a span of three years water hyacinth has spread the entire length of Steele \nBayou. Large, dense mats have completely blocked the Bayou immediately south of the \nYazoo National Wildlife Refuge blocking all boat traffic, eliminating recreational \nopportunities, and decreasing dissolved oxygen levels.  Chemical control measures using \n2-  4D can and will be used.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation and the \nWashington County Drainage District will coordinate mechanical removal of water \nhyacinth.  The Mississippi Levee Board will provide herbicide and application required \nfor treatment while Delta F.A.R.M. will provide additional assistance with application.  \n \nThe severe water hyacinth problems faced on Steele Bayou have prompted members of \nthe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality’s Yazoo River Basin Team to form \na work group focused on the detection, monitoring, and control of aquatic weeds.  \nRepresentatives from multiple natural resource agencies plan to increase communication \nand cooperative efforts to combat aquatic invasive weeds throughout the entire Delta.  \n \nBudget \n \nProjected costs for control of noxious aquatic vegetation are listed in Table 7. \n \nTable 5.

Public access to Steele Bayou is very limited, thereby reducing \npublic use and the importance of MDWFP’s activities in the watershed.   \n \nTo address silver carp concerns, Delta Wildlife and Mississippi State University have \nsubmitted a request for funding from the National Sea Grant Program.  The proposed \nproject would monitor the movements of silver carp in Steele Bayou and associated \nfloodplains to better understand and predict their movements, allowing for increased \nharvest by selective traps and commercial fisherman.   \n   \nBudget \n \nProjected costs associated with fisheries survey and management. \n \nTable 6.

Specific objectives of education efforts in the \nwatershed include the following. \n \n• Increase farmer and landowner awareness of the value of clean water and their \nresponsibility to insure others downstream have clean water. \n• Increase farmer and landowner knowledge of programs that offer financial and/or \ntechnical assistance to plan, design, and/or install BMPs to improve water quality.   \n• Increase public awareness of the value of clean water. \n• Increase public awareness of how common activities affect water quality and \ncritical flora and fauna. \n• Increase public awareness of how BMPs can be used to reduce negative water \nquality and habitat affects. \n• Increase public awareness of the long term environmental and economic \nadvantages of protecting and improving water quality and habitat in the Steele \nBayou watershed. \n• Increase public awareness of aquatic invasive species and how to prevent their \naccidental spread. \n \nParticipants \n \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nDelta Wildlife \nMississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service 4-H Program \nMississippi Levee Board \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \nMississippi Bureau of Plant Industry \nMississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nEducation and outreach are part of Delta Wildlife and Delta F.A.R.M.’s mission. Delta \nWildlife publishes a quarterly magazine as Delta F.AR.M. publishes a quarterly \nnewsletter for members and make educational presentations at schools and to various \n\n 22 \ngroups.  A portion of these efforts will be targeted towards landowners and residents in \nthis watershed.  Furthermore, the organization will use other means of outreach through \npress releases and their website.  This implementation plan will also be available on both \norganization’s website along with information for landowners in the watershed who wish \nto participate.  Additionally, bumper stickers will be designed and offered free of charge \nto increase awareness and stakeholder participation in the WIP process. \nDelta F.A.R.M. and the Issaquena County 4-H Program will be partnering to develop and \nplace signs at Steele Bayou boat ramps that will increase the public’s awareness of \ninvasive aquatic plants and how to reduce the risk of transport and spread.  Delta \nF.A.R.M. will also host a field day for high school students in the 4-H program to \nintroduce and educate them on locally occurring aquatic invasive species.  \n \nPress releases and magazine articles in publications of partnering agencies are also an \nimportant component of the educational outreach plan.  The Mississippi Levee Board, \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry, \nand Mississippi’s Lower Delta Partnership all publish monthly or quarterly \nmagazines/newsletters that will serve as important outlets for increasing awareness of \nSteele Bayou and different components of the WIP. \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n 23 \nEvaluation \n  \nMonitoring \n \nParticipants \n \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) \n \nImplementation/Action \n \nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) will collect suspended sediment samples \nfrom Steele Bayou main channel periodically at four bridge crossings, and at five field \nedge locations where grade control structures will be installed.  USGS will collect \nsamples during four storm runoff trips from the main channel per year, beginning in \n2008.  Up to 24 discrete samples will be captured from the edge of field sites using \nautomatic samplers during each of the four storm runoff trips.  Samples will be analyzed \nby the USGS Baton Rouge Sediment Laboratory to determine the efficacy of the grade \ncontrol structures.  Water stage recorders will be installed at the four main channel sites \nalong with discharge measurements and annual cross-sectional survey to document \nsediment depositions and changes in channel morphology. \n \nBudget \n \nTable 7.

Water quality data, as well as information on activities occurring in the \nwatershed and stakeholder concerns collected during the period from 2007 – 2013 will be \nutilized. The following criteria will be used to determine progress toward plan goals: \n \n• Reduction of sediment load by at least 2 tons/year, and  \n• Achievement of all Mississippi water quality criteria. \n \n \n \n\n 24 \nPlan Evaluation Procedure \n \nThis watershed implementation plan will be evaluated and revised in 2012. The \nevaluation of this plan will be organized by the Steele Bayou Implementation Team \nbeginning in January 2013. At this time the Implementation Team will develop a detailed \nschedule for review and revision of this watershed implementation plan. The \nImplementation Team members will be responsible for notifying their stakeholders of the \nopportunity to propose changes to the watershed implementation plan. One month will be \nallowed for notification of stakeholders. \n \nThe plan will be evaluated by the Team, or their designee, and any interested \nstakeholders. One month will be allowed for evaluation and submittal of comments. \nTherefore, comments will be due two months after the evaluation procedure is initiated. \nThe plan will be evaluated in two ways. First, to determine if the plan goals have been \nachieved. Second, to determine if it reflects the current condition of the watershed, state \nof science, and issues in the watershed.  \n \nPlan Revision Procedure \n \nAfter evaluation, MDEQ will prepare a revised watershed implementation plan \nincorporating the changes requested by the reviewers. At this point it may be necessary to \ncall a meeting to reconcile any conflicting comments or requests for change.  \n \nIf the evaluation criteria are all being met in Steele Bayou surface waters, the watershed \nimplementation plan will be revised to address a different restoration issue or issues, or to \nprotect the quality of the watershed. If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the \napproach for restoring Steele Bayou watershed quality will be revised based on \nknowledge that has been gained since 2008.  \n \nThe draft watershed implementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team, \nand all others who submitted comments. Within two weeks of receiving the draft \nwatershed implementation plan, the Implementation Team will notify their stakeholders \nof the availability of the revised watershed implementation plan for stakeholder review. \nOne month will be allowed for review of the draft. Comments will be due at the end of \nthis review period. \n \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft watershed implementation plan are \nreceived, MDEQ will prepare a final watershed implementation plan. The final watershed \nimplementation plan will be submitted to the Implementation Team for review and \napproval. After the final watershed implementation plan has been approved, the \nImplementation Team will notify their stakeholders of the completion and availability of \nthe final plan for use as a guide to watershed restoration and protection activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n 25 \nReferences \n \nFreedman, P.L., W.M.

Sediment/Siltation is the primary concern of both \nregulatory agencies and stakeholders.  Sediment, erosion, \nand all other contributors to sediment loading must be \nstopped through the used of BMPs.  Primary contributor is \nnon-point source agricultural runoff. \n1b. Low DO/Organic Enrichment. Other activities such as \nAG BMP’s and Aquatic Weed Control will address this \nconcern as well. \n1c.  High Nutrients.  Specific lakes and stream segments in \nthe Steele Bayou Watershed are listed for High Nutrients.  \nAg BMPs should address most nutrient loading. \n1d.  Fish Advisories/Legacy Pesticides.  DDT can be found \nin fish tissue and soils within the watershed.  The only \ncourse of action is to further reduce sedimentation by using \nag BMPs. \n1e.  Noxious Aquatic Vegetation.  Water Hyacinth threatens \nboth recreational access and water quality through organic \nenrichment and DO demand during the fall and winter.  \nWater Hyacinth will be treated by chemical and mechanical \nmeans and funded by MDOT, MS Levee Board, \nWashington County Drainage District, and MDEQ.   \n1f. Fisheries Management.  MDWFP will continue to \nmonitor the fishery for changes due to the invasion of silver \ncarp and take action if a solution is found. \n \nTable 1 \nStructures for Water Control (25 units minimum) \nOverfall Pipes (39 units minimum) \nWater diversion pads (1000 feet minimum) \nBank Stabilization ( 4 minimum) \nRip-rap weirs ( 5 minimum) \n \nPage 15 \nAg BMP $3,803456 \nNoxious Aquatics $27,350 \nFisheries Management $185,148 \nTOTAL $4,015,954 \nTables 4, 5, 6 \nThe overall objective of the education strategy in the Steele \nBayou watershed is to develop an atmosphere that promotes \nsustained, long-term protection and improvement of aquatic \nresources in the watershed. \nPage 20 \nImplementation will be dependent on the cooperation of the \nprivate landowners. \nPage 14 \nUSGS will conduct water quality monitoring plan.
