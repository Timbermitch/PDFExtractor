Natural Resources Conservation Service \n(NRCS), Mississippi Soil & Water Conservation Commission (MSWCC), and the Oktibbeha \nCounty Soil & Water Conservation District (OCSWCD). To assist reviewers of this plan, the \nAppendix A contains a cross-reference for required EPA 319 watershed-based plan elements \nand Appendix B contains a proposed work plan with milestones. This is a working document \nwith future editions likely through an adaptive management process.  \n2 INTRODUCTION  \nA significant portion of MSU’s campus and property resides within the Catalpa Creek \nWatershed (referenced by USGS as the Red Bud-Catalpa Creek Watershed, HUC 12 \n#031601040601, and by MDEQ as MWS #8090). This includes important MSU education and \nresearch facilities, such as the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station’s \n(MAFES) H.H. Leveck Animal Research Center (South Farm) and the Bearden Dairy Research \nUnit (Dairy Unit), which is used by numerous departments and programs. Unfortunately, some \nof MSU’s land uses in this watershed may be contributing to the pollution of Catalpa Creek. At \npresent there is a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) determination for sediment for Catalpa \nCreek. Monitoring studies showed that two other pollutants (nutrients and pathogens) were \npresent in excessive amounts in Tibbee Creek, of which Catalpa Creek is a tributary; TMDLs \nhave been completed for those pollutants as well.  \nIn April 2013, MSU, through the Mississippi Water Resources Research Institute (MWRRI), was \ndesignated a Center of Excellence for Watershed Management with the signing of a \nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the MDEQ, Region 4 of the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), and MSU. The MOU recognized that MWRRI had \n“demonstrated to the satisfaction of EPA and MDEQ that it has the capacity and capability to \nidentify and address the needs of the local watershed stakeholders” and was charged to “work \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   2 \n \nwith colleges and universities in Mississippi to engage students (graduate and undergraduate), \nfaculty, and staff from the full suite of disciplines needed to adequately address specific \nwatershed issues” and to “draw upon other local, state, federal resources and expertise.” \nMWRRI, in its role as a Center of Excellence for Watershed Management, is advantageously \npositioned to bring resources together from various MSU departments and programs, other \nstatewide stakeholder organizations, and state and federal agencies to address the needs \nwithin the Catalpa Creek Watershed. This project will not only put appropriate structural \npractices on the ground in strategic locations in the watershed to restore water quality and \nhabitat, but also establish a venue for watershed-based demonstrations, research, education, \napplication and sustainable management. \n3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe Catalpa Creek Watershed is located in Oktibbeha and Lowndes counties in the northeast \nregion of Mississippi and is part of the larger Tombigbee River Basin. The 28,928 acre \nwatershed contains 31 miles of mainstream perennial stream length. The stream network \nempties into Tibbee Creek which flows into Columbus Lake on the Tennessee-Tombigbee \nWaterway north of Columbus, MS. At the HUC-12 level, the watershed includes part of the \nMississippi State University Campus, the MSU South Farm research facility and dairy farm, as \nwell as a number of privately owned lands. Originally, the land in the watershed was- primarily \nprairie. Current land use includes 44% in hay production/pasture land, 10% in cultivated crops, \n9% in developed land, and 8% in wetlands or open water.  \nResearch activities of the university and continued development and construction on university \nlands appear to be a primary driver of stream, ecosystem, and water quality degradation. \nCatalpa Creek is currently listed by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n(MDEQ) as impaired by sedimentation and a TMDL has been developed that sets challenging \ntargets for sediment load reductions. Two MSU facilities on the South Farm are permitted point \nsources – the Poultry Science Research Center and the Ag Center and Horse Park. The agency \nhas ranked the watershed as having a high stressor potential, which means compared to other \nwatersheds in the area Catalpa Creek is a watershed in need of restoration. MDEQ supports \nfour sites in the watershed to monitor its biological health.  \nA comprehensive suite of management practices has been selected to address the agricultural \nresource concerns identified for the watershed – sedimentation, grazing lands, sustainable \nforestry, and declining wildlife habitats. The management practices to mitigate sedimentation \nrange from grade stabilization structures, sediment basins, and grassed waterways to critical \narea plantings, field borders, and terraces. Management practices to address protect grazing \nlands include fencing, pond construction, prescribed grazing, heavy use protection, livestock \nshelters, and watering facilities. Practices to foster sustainable forestry include land clearing, \nforest site preparation, and tree and shrub establishment. Practices to restore declining wildlife \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   3 \n \ninclude water control structures, forage and biomass planting, and forest stand improvement. \nSome of these practices address multiple resource concerns.  \nIn addition to the agricultural resource concerns, urban storm water management is a key need \nfor the watershed and a focus of this restoration and protection plan. MSU’s Master Plan (MSU, \n2010) contains numerous urban storm water management techniques and approaches, and will \nbe leveraged with this water resources management plan. These include: design and \nimplementation of low impact development (LID) solutions in future campus planning and \ndevelopment; on-site storm water treatment (where feasible) on all newly constructed campus \nbuildings and landscape projects; 100-foot buffers on all campus streams; protecting and re-\nvegetating landscape areas around existing creeks and drainage ways; directing storm water \nflow from existing creek beds to water receiving landscapes that are designed to allow for \ninfiltration and slow discharge; enhancing landscapes around existing on-site water resources \nwith vegetated filters and water absorbent plantings at storm water discharge points; and \nconstruction of storm water retention basins.    \nThe project has a number of unique features. These include an education, experiential learning, \nand outreach approach that begins by better understanding the behaviors, perceptions, and \nbeliefs of watershed stakeholders. This will be addressed by pre and post implementation \nsurveys. Creation of experiential learning opportunities for students will also be a focus of the \nproject. A comprehensive monitoring and assessment approach will be implemented for this \nproject, including traditional physical/chemical water quality monitoring, macroinvertebrate \nhabitat assessments, use of indicator species to evaluate ecosystem restoration progress, and \nsocial indicators to understand improvements in stakeholder behaviors and perceptions and \nthe effectiveness of educational and outreach activities. Other unique features include analyses \nand designs to restore the structure and function of Catalpa Creek and for siting storm water \nretention basins to mitigate downstream storm water impacts. Also, incorporated into the \nproject is a focus on watershed sustainability from several perspectives – habitat/ecosystem \nhealth, water quality and quantity, and the continuance of concerted, collaborative efforts to \ninvolve local watershed champions and businesses to foster “collective ownership” of the \nwatershed. Such an approach supports MSU’s Vision 20/20 and will tie-in MSU’s Office of \nSustainability.  \nProbably, the most ambitious component of the project is to leverage these restoration and \nprotection activities into the establishment of a Watershed D.R.E.A.M.S. (Demonstration, \nResearch, Education, Application, Management and Sustainability) Center. Supported by the \nhighest administrative levels of the university and throughout its faculty, the Watershed \nD.R.E.A.M.S. Center is envisioned as an ongoing collaborative campus-wide project that links \ntogether and is supported by over 18 university departments, institutes, programs (i.e., units). \nDemonstrating innovative applied research, sustainable water resources management, and \neffective and quantifiable education and experiential learning is the overarching mission of the \nD.R.E.A.M.S. Center. It is also envisioned that the D.R.E.A.M.S. Center will provide effective \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   4 \n \ntraining opportunities for state and federal conservation agencies and organizations through \ndemonstrations of best management practices, pollutant reduction strategies, water \nmanagement applications, and more.  \n4 CONTENTS \nThis comprehensive Water Resources Management Plan for the Catalpa Creek Watershed \nincorporates the elements prescribed in EPA’s Handbook for Developing Watershed Plans to \nRestore and Protect Our Waters (EPA, 2008).

The vision of the Catalpa Creek Watershed Restoration & Protection Project is to \nrestore and protect the ecosystem health, ecosystem services and quality of life, and water \nresources within the watershed; develop an informed citizenry in the watershed and beyond; \nand create experiential learning activities for students, educators, and practitioners. \nGoals.  The desired outcomes of this vision are identified below:  \n Ecosystem Health – restoring and protecting the biological integrity and ecological \nfunctions of the watershed, and restoring stream hydrology and geomorphology;  \n Water Resources – reducing pathogen, nutrients and sediment loads in order to meet  \napplicable water quality standards and protect the downstream beneficial/designated \nuses that are threatened by upstream land uses;   \n Quality of Life – maintaining the quality of life for stakeholders in the Catalpa Creek \nWatershed related to currently available water resources in the event of future land use \nchanges;  \n Experiential Learning – creating and facilitating experiential learning opportunities for \nuniversity students and faculty, secondary educators and students, and others through \nprojects, workshops, camps, demonstrations, and other activities;  \n Collaboration – fostering collaborative activities among university departments and \nprograms, state and federal agencies, stakeholder organizations and watershed \nstakeholders, and leveraging available resources; and  \n Sustainability – advancing sustainable watershed management applications for the \nagricultural and urban environments.     \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   8 \n \n6 APPROACH  \nEPA Handbook.  The process followed to develop this comprehensive Water Resources \nManagement Plan for the Catalpa Creek Watershed is prescribed in EPA’s Handbook for \nDeveloping Watershed Plans to Restore and Protect Our Waters (EPA, 2008). The six-step \nprocess includes:  \n1. Building partnerships; \n2. Characterizing the watershed;  \n3. Finalizing goals and identifying solutions;  \n4. Designing an implementation program;  \n5. Implementing the watershed plan; and  \n6. Measuring progress and making adjustments.  \nHolistic Approach.  A holistic, multi-disciplinary approach to achieve the goals stated in the \npreceding section is incorporated into this plan. The approach incorporates an array of \ndisciplines from the sciences (e.g., hydrogeology, soils, biology, ecology, climatology), \nengineering (e.g., civil, environmental, agricultural), social science, education, administration, \nfacilitation, and economics. The approach also focuses on an array of factors, including \nadherence to state law; restoration; protection; education, experiential learning, and outreach; \nintegration of MSU’s Master Plan (Sections 6.5, 11.3); use of established programs, strategies, \ntools, and practices; development of innovative strategies, tools, and practices; documentation \nof implementation  progress; and sustainability in several contexts.  \n6.1 FOCUS ON STATE LAW  \nMississippi’s Water Law (§ 51-3-1) states in part:  \n \n\"It is hereby declared that the general welfare of the people of the State of Mississippi \nrequires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent \nof which they are capable, that the waste or unreasonable use, or unreasonable method \nof use, of water be prevented, that the conservation of such water be exercised with the \nview to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof in the interest of the people, and that \nthe public and private funds for the promotion and expansion of the beneficial use of \nwater resources shall be invested to the end that the best interests and welfare of the \npeople are served.” \nThe approach to water resources management in the Water Resources Management Plan \nfor Red Bud-Catalpa Creek Watershed follows this legislative guidance. The plan focuses \non the end point, i.e., creating sustainable water resources and ecosystems for all. Both \nnonstructural and structural practices are recommended, as is a targeted education, \nexperiential learning and outreach effort that incorporates social indicators to evaluate \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   9 \n \nprogress made in stakeholder behaviors, perceptions and beliefs, and to inform the \nadaptive management process upon which the plan is constructed.  \n6.2 FOCUS ON RESTORATION   \nAreas of Focus.  Watershed restoration is the return of an ecosystem to as close an \napproximation of its state prior to a specific event or period of degradation. The approach \nto restoration contained in this plan focuses on:  \n Reducing nutrients, pathogens, and sediment in the watershed and implementing \nCatalpa Creek’s sediment TMDL by lowering the presence of sediment in the creek \nto within acceptable levels; \n Restoring the geomorphology and function of Catalpa Creek that has been \ndegraded by upstream conversion from natural conditions to urban land uses; and   \n Restoring the ecosystems and habitat of the watershed.   \nMississippi’s Upland Nutrient Reduction Strategic Plan.  Integral to this focus is the \nincorporation of Mississippi’s Upland Nutrient Reduction Strategic Plan. This plan (MDEQ, \n2011) will guide the related planning and implementation activities within the Catalpa \nCreek Watershed.  \n6.3 FOCUS ON PROTECTION   \nThe watershed protection described in this plan focuses on:  \n Protecting surface water resources  and maximum appropriate reuse of \nwastewater;  \n Protecting public and private drinking  water supplies;  \n Conserving ecosystem/habitat/water resources through sustainable management; \nand   \n Sustaining quality of life and human health within the watershed. \n6.4 FOCUS ON EDUCATION, EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, AND OUTREACH   \nKey components to successfully changing stakeholder behaviors, perceptions and beliefs \nis first understanding what they are, then developing and implementing effective \neducation and experiential learning activities. Incorporating incremental surveys and \nadaptive management as part of this effort fosters opportunities to learn the \neffectiveness of our educational activities and to make improvements moving forward. \nAn Education, Experiential Learning, and Outreach Team has been established that will \nwork collaboratively to develop and implement education plans to effect behavior \nchange, create experiential learning activities, produce and disseminate educational \nmaterials, and develop tours (self, guided, and virtual) to demonstrate the principles and \npractices employed through this project.  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   10 \n \n6.5 FOCUS ON INTEGRATED URBAN LAND USE PLANNING AND WATERSHED-SCALE PLANNING \nIn 2010, MSU released its Master Plan that provides a vision for the campus informed by \nthe academic, research and outreach mission of the university; the history, traditions and \nresources of the campus; the enrollment targets and aspirations for the future; and the \nsustainability goals established by the university. Because of the location of a portion of \nMSU’s campus in the headwaters of the Catalpa Creek Watershed, the need and \nopportunity exists to integrate urban land use planning contained in MSU’s Master Plan \nwith watershed-scale planning for the 28,939 acre watershed.  \n6.6 USE OF ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS, STRATEGIES, TOOLS, AND PRACTICES  \nCurrent watershed-based efforts in Mississippi and most states rely upon coordination \nwith and support of state and federal programs. This project is no exception. Numerous \nprograms within multiple state and federal agencies are already collaboratively working \ntogether to advance the vision and goals of this project.   \n6.7 DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES, TOOLS, AND PRACTICES \nPollution caused by excessive levels of pathogens and indicator species (e.g., fecal \ncoliform) is pervasive across Mississippi. Since the Catalpa Creek Watershed encompasses \nthe equine, cattle, poultry, and aquaculture research units, there will be ample \nopportunity to showcase both established and innovative structural practices to reduce \npathogen and nutrient levels in Catalpa Creek. \nAdditional innovative strategies being considered include a water reuse strategy for storm \nand waste water, and a habitat conservation plan. Innovative models, tools, and best \nmanagement practices are envisioned for development as part of this effort.    \n6.8 FOCUS ON DOCUMENTATION OF PROGRESS  \nThe establishment of water quality targets, ecosystem/habitat conservation goals, and \nsocial indicators will provide the basis for scientifically-defensible measures of progress \nfor the project. The monitoring plan (Section 12) provides more information on this \nelement.  \n6.9 FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY \nSustainability will be addressed in the contexts of the water resources of Catalpa Creek \nWatershed and of project development. The integrated, holistic approach to restoring \nand protecting the water resources of the watershed is designed for sustainability.  This \nincludes not just protection efforts following restoration but also conservation endeavors \nfor waters of good quality. Maintenance of structural practices over time is crucial in \nmoving towards sustainability.  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   11 \n \nIn order to reach these goals, critical human and fiscal resources must be secured. One of \nthe components of the initial stakeholders survey will be to find local watershed \nchampions – individuals and businesses that are motivated to become involved in the \nproject. We will find the incentives that will attract support for the project on a long-term \nbasis. To that end a Funding and Incentives Team has been established.   \n7 PARTNERSHIPS AND TEAMS \nTo successfully conceptualize, develop, and implement these projects, significant effort has \ngone into building partnerships among MSU departments, centers and institutes as well as \namong state & federal resource agencies, stakeholder organizations and other forums. \nLikewise, significant effort has been directed toward organizing and facilitating a number of \nteams that work collaboratively to address the vision and objectives of the project.  \nThe overall effort is led by MAFES, which directs the activities of the South Farm. Overall \nplanning and facilitation activities are supported by MWRRI. To assist MWRRI with its planning \nand facilitation role, an informal core planning team routinely meets to advance planning for \nthe projects. This core planning team consists of the leads or co-leads of three functional teams \nand a work group (identified later in this section) as well as several Steering Team members.  \n7.1 PARTNERSHIPS  \nCollaborative partnerships built to support this project include multiple MSU units \n(departments, institutes, and centers) as well as multiple state and federal resource \nagencies and stakeholder organizations.  \nParticipating MSU Units.  The Catalpa Creek Watershed Restoration & Protection Project \nand its companion Catalpa & Sand Creek Watershed D.R.E.A.M.S. (Demonstration, \nResearch, Education, Application, Management and Sustainability) Center (Section 15) \ncreate opportunities for involvement by a wide range of MSU departments and programs. \nCurrently, 21 units at MSU are participating in these projects (Table 7.1.1).  Many of these \ndepartments and programs already have ongoing research activities at the South Farm.  \nResource Agencies and Stakeholder Organizations.  A wide range of state and federal \nresource agency and stakeholder organization partners are participating with these \nprojects (Table 7.1.2). These organizations have programs that range from providing \ntechnical and educational assistance to being potential sources of funding support. Most \nof these organizations also participate on MDEQ’s North Independent Streams/Tennessee \nRiver/Tombigbee River Basin Team. \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   12 \n \nTable 7.1.1.

These teams \nconsist of members of MSU faculty and administration as well as state and federal \nresource agencies and stakeholder organizations who have expertise and experience in \nthe teams’ area of focus. A priority activity of each team is contributing to the \ndevelopment of this water resources management plan. The functional teams are:  \n Planning and Implementation; \n Education, Experiential Learning and Outreach; and  \n Funding and Incentives.  \nIt is anticipated that issue-specific work groups will be established during the planning \nprocess to address narrowly-focused issues (e.g., development of a pathogen mitigation \nstrategy).  \n7.4 PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION TEAM \n \nThe primary role and responsibility of the Planning and Implementation Team is the \nfacilitation and development of this Catalpa Creek Water Resource Management Plan. \nTeam members will also be encouraged to participate in conceptualizing, developing, and \nimplementing potential research projects associated with the Watershed D.R.E.A.M.S. \nCenter (Section 15). Current team members and their department or affiliation are \nidentified in Table 7.4.1.  \nAn individual component of the Planning and Implementation Team is the \nHydrology/Modeling Work Group.

Because of this, a number of formal and informal meetings of stakeholders of the \nCatalpa Creek Watershed have been held. Recurring meetings of these stakeholders are \nplanned for the future. This will include meetings of MSU administration to address issues \nrelated to the university and its landholdings as well as public meetings of watershed \nstakeholders that include MSU staff who live in the watershed.   \nAs previously mentioned, on January 13, 2015, a visioning exercise was held with MSU, MDEQ, \nMSWCC, and NRCS administration, staff, and faculty to outline a vision for restoring and \nprotecting the Catalpa Creek Watershed. The day-long exercise include presentations to \nprovide an overview of the Catalpa Creek Watershed and MSU’s strategic position within it, \nrelate information on the status of water quality and land use within the watershed, a \nfacilitated session during which a number of questions were posed to the participants, and \nafterward a facilitated tour of the watershed ensued.   \nQuestions asked and discussed during the facilitated session included: What is your vision of \nthe Catalpa Creek Watershed in terms of ecosystem health, water resources, quality of life, \nengaging watershed stakeholders, providing opportunities for responsible economic growth, \nand providing experiential learning and research opportunities for students and teachers? \nOther questions asked and discussed were: What are impacts and results you want to achieve \nfor the watershed community, for MSU, for your organization/program, and for the region and \nstate? What should be the project’s focus? What interests should be addressed? What \nchallenges/barriers will we face? Why is the Catalpa Creek Watershed project important from \nyour perspective? Who could benefit from its implementation? In what ways? How should \nprogress be measures? Additional questions address staffing and resource support, next steps, \nand the D.R.E.A.M.S. Center.  \nAfter the exercise, a vision document was developed that incorporated input generated during \nthe session. This document serves to guide MSU’s restoration and protection efforts, and \nnarrative from this document is incorporated throughout this plan (e.g., sections on Vision and \nProject Goals, Approach, Partnerships and Teams, Sustainability, D.R.E.A.M.S. Center, et al).   \nOn September 1, 2015 a meeting was held with the Oktibbeha County Soil & Water \nConservation District (OCSWCD) Board of Commissioners to provide an overview of the \nwatershed, status of water quality, present the vision, solicit input on OCSWCD’s water \nresource interests and concerns, and request it to partner in the project and co-host a meeting \nof watershed stakeholders. The Board unanimously approved the requests. OCSWCD’s water \nresource interests and concerns are incorporated into this plan.     \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   18 \n \nOn September 28, 2015 an evening, catered meeting of watershed stakeholders, City of \nStarkville representatives, and Oktibbeha County representatives will be co-hosted by MSU and \nOCSWCD for the purpose of greeting and getting to know watershed stakeholders, presenting \nand discussing the vision, requesting input from these parties regarding their interests and \nconcerns, recruiting potential team members, and soliciting partners to participate in \nrestoration and protection activities in the watershed. Informal meetings with watershed \nstakeholders have already revealed concerns related to downstream impacts of urban storm \nwater and flooding, both of which are a focus of this plan. Any newly identified interests and \nconcerns during this meeting and through subsequent contact with watershed stakeholders will \nbe incorporated into a revised plan.     \nAs mentioned previously, we will stress the importance of continued stakeholder involvement \nand participation as the project unfolds and recurring meetings are planned for the future. \nAdditionally, a key feature of the project that is discussed later in this document is the \nimplementation of pre- and post-implementation surveys to better understand stakeholder \nbehaviors and beliefs to guide education and outreach efforts, as well as to identify potential \nwatershed “champions” and business support to foster sustainability of this watershed-based \neffort.   \n9 WATERSHED DESCRIPTION AND CHARACTERIZATION \n9.1 GEOGRAPHY & GEOMORPHOLOGY \nThe Catalpa Creek watershed begins in Starkville, Mississippi and extends over areas of \nOktibbeha and Lowndes counties.  Catalpa Creek is part of the Red Bud Creek-Catalpa \nCreek (HUC 12 #031601040601) watershed which lies within the larger Catalpa Creek-\nTibbee Creek (HUC 10), Tibbee Watershed (HUC 8) and part of the large Tombigbee River \nBasin.  The Red Bud - Catalpa Creek Watershed covers an area of 45.2 square miles \n(28,939 acres). \nResearch activities of the university and continued development and construction of \nuniversity lands appears to be a primary driver of stream degradation and water quality \ndegradation. Impervious surfaces cause substantial runoff from the university at the \nheadwater of the stream, resulting in marked increases in hydrologic flow during storm \nevents, much above the regular capacity of the channel.  Such runoff has been observed \nto cause major flooding and back flow issues, as well as contributing to severe erosion \nwithin the channel, incision of the main channel, and turbidity/sediment issues regarding \nwater quality. \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   19 \n \nThe National Hydrography Dataset “flowline” classifications of “perennial stream” and \n“intermittent stream” can be used to distinguish the mainstream channels from the \ntributaries (Figure 9.1.1). The Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed features 31 miles of \nperennial streams and 119 miles of intermittent streams. On land owned by Mississippi \nState University, 6.5 miles of perennial streams and 11 miles of intermittent streams are \nfound. \n \n \n \nFigure 9.1.1. Main stem (perennial) and tributary (intermittent) streams in the Red Bud Creek – Catalpa Creek Watershed \n \nThe headwaters of Catalpa Creek emerge from underground culverts on or near the \nMSU campus at three locations: the parking lot on the northeast corner of Highway 12 \nand Spring Street (33° 27’ 16.64” N, 88° 48’ 17.84 W), 130 meters (418 feet) south of the \nintersection of Bully Boulevard and Stone Boulevard (33° 27’ 02.19” N, 88° 47’ 42.17” \nW), and 60 meters (200 feet) west of the southern end of Hardy Road (33° 66’ 53.23 N, \n88° 47’ 25.75 W) (Figure 9.1.2). \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   20 \n \n \nFigure 9.1.2. Catalpa Creek origination points associated with the Mississippi State University campus and intermittent \nstream flow lines from the National Hydrographic Database (NHD). NHD flow line endpoint vertices do not match actual \nlocations of stream emergence from underground conveyance systems. \n \nThe Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed lies completely within the Blackland Prairie \n(65a) Ecoregion (EPA Level IV, Figure 9.1.3), a crescent-shaped belt that extends from \nthe Mississippi-Tennessee border through Montgomery, Alabama. Blackland Prairie is \ndescribed by Chapman et al. (2004) as a flat to undulating region underlain by distinctive \nCretaceous-age chalk, marl, and calcareous clays of the Selma Group. These clays have \nsmectitic or carbonatic mineralogy and tend to shrink and crack when dry and swell \nwhen wet. Streams have chalk, clay, sand, and silt substrates and flow is highly variable. \nHistorically the natural vegetation of this ecoregion was dominated by sweetgum \n(Liquidamber styraciflua), post oak (Quercus stellate), blackjack oak (Q. marialndica), \nand red cedar (Juniperis virginiana), with patches of prairie dominated by warm-season \ngrasses and forbs. The total amount of area historically covered by these has been the \nsubject of debate, and although the region is often referred to or characterized as \n“prairie” most writers consider it to be a mosaic of vegetation types: open prairie, chalk \noutcrops, woodland, and forest. Barone (2005) concludes that, while never dominant, \nthe prairie patches once formed an important and coherent ecosystem. \n \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   21 \n \n \nFigure 9.1.3. Ecoregion Map of Northeast Mississippi (EPA). \nThe dip of the Cretaceous strata is generally towards the Gulf of Mexico in Alabama and \ntowards the Mississippi River in Mississippi, causing the geologic formations to be \nprogressively older in a northeastward direction. The Selma group formations in the Red \nBud Creek – Catalpa Creek watershed are (in an east-to-west/old-to-young progression) \nDemopolis Chalk, Ripley, and Prairie Bluff/Owl Creek (Figure 9.1.4). \nThe Surface Geology Division at the MDEQ website hosts a list of geology unit \ndescriptions for the state, from which these are described: \n Demopolis chalk: Chalk and marly chalk containing fewer impurities than \nunderlying and overlying formations.  \n Ripley: Grey to greenish-gray fine glauconitic sand, clay, and sandy limestone. \n Prairie Bluff and Owl Creek: Prairie Bluff chalk, compact brittle chalk, sandy chalk, \nand calcareous clay; at base contains many phosphatic molds of fossils. \n \nElevations in the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed range from 197 – 404 feet with \nthe highest points found in Starkville and on the campus of MSU (Figure 9.1.5). \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   22 \n \n \nFigure 9.1.4. Geological formations of the Red Bud Creek – Catalpa Creek Watershed. \n \nFigure 9.1.5. Elevations Map of the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   23 \n \nSmall tributaries at the upper part of the watershed, including the main stream reach \nbefore Blackjack Road (Figure 9.1.6), are stable grassed channels that present some \nbackwater flow and floodplain flooding during high stormflow events caused by the \npresence of downstream hydraulic structures (i.e. culverts and dam). However, these \nstreams appear to present an early stage of incision probably due to their very low \nsinuosity and the increase in extension of developed areas on the MSU campus, which \nreduce the time of concentration and increase the magnitude of the peak flow discharges \nduring stormflow events that usually occur during the winter and spring seasons, most \ncommonly, when the groundcover of the streambanks is reduced. \n \n \n \nFigure 9.1.6. Headwater tributaries of the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed. \nThe incised main channel of the Catalpa Creek experiences undercutting, streambed \noutcrop, and streambank instability along several segments of the approximated four \nmiles this waterbody runs through the MSU South Farm (Figure 9.1.7). These channel \ndegradation processes alternate with the presence of sand and gravel bars observed a few \nfeet upstream of road crossings and stream junctions, and inside of bendway segments \n(Figure 9.1.8). The culvert on the main stream on Blackjack Road, at the boundary of the \nMSU campus, appears to be an initial knickpoint that has importantly affected the flow \nregime and sediment transport capacity of the fluvial system downstream. These \nconditions, in addition to the high flows coming from the campus during stormflow \nevents, the very low sinuosity of the channel, the presence of a hydraulic structure (dam) \nin a tributary, additional road crossings along the main stream, and several point source \nflows (i.e. pi\n\npes) appear to be increasing the channel slope, and increasing undercutting, \nstreambed erosion and incision, and streambank failure of the main stream and \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   24 \n \ntributaries, including the Turkey Creek. Accessibility to the streams is very limited and \nunstable active streambanks are easily identified. Rates of streambank erosion are not \nreported for the Catalpa Creek or its tributaries, yet, but studies in the Ecoregion 65 in \nMississippi have reported widening rates of up to 2.7 m per year (Ramirez-Avila, 2011, \nSimon et al., 2002). Right at the boundary of the university’s research farm, the stream \nmaintains its incised conditions, but an increase in its sinuosity is evidenced by the most \ncommon presence of segments with sequential patterns of rills and pools, and a reduction \nin the channel slope and the streambank sides’ slopes (Figure 9.1.7). Undercutting and \nactive unstable streambanks are observed, but their frequency along the watercourse \ntowards the MSU beef unit facility and the watershed outlet is reduced. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9.1.7. Evidences of low sinuosity, active unstable streambanks, undercutting and streambed \nerosion/outcrop along the main stream and below a hydraulic structure in a tributary of the Red Bud – \nCatalpa Creek Watershed. \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   25 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9.1.8. Sand and gravel bars formation along internal sides of bendways, upstream of streams junction and stream \nsegments with abundant vegetation along the main stream of the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   26 \n \nThe proposed Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) \nfor the Tibbee Creek (MDEQ, 2006) determined \nthe main stream of the Catalpa Creek watershed \nwas biologically impaired due to sediments, and \nrecommended that streams within the entire \nTibbee Creek watershed be considered a priority \nfor streambank and riparian buffer zone \nrestoration and sediment reduction Best \nManagement Practices (BMPs), especially for the \ncultivated lands, road crossings and construction \nactivities (MDEQ, 2006). The targeted sediment \nyield for the Tibbee Creek watershed ranges from \n0.0004 to 0.0018 tons per acre per day at the \neffective discharge, also known as bankfull \ndischarge (Q\n1.5\n). This range was reported by \nSimon et al. (2002) to determine acceptable \nsediment yields for stable streams within the \nentire Ecoregion 65. The estimated existing range \nfor the Tibbee Creek waterbodies included in the \nTMDL is 0.002 to 0.054 tons per acre per day at \nthe effective discharge. Using the area-sediment \nload relationship generated by Ramirez-Avila et \nal. (2015b) (Figure 9.1.10, Figure 9.1.11), the daily \nsediment load for the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek \nWatershed is 0.005 ton/acre per day, which falls \ninto the range proposed by the TMDL report. \n \nFigure 9.1.10.

(2015b)). \n9.2 SOILS  \n \nThe majority of the soils in the Red Bud-Catalpa Creek Watershed (Figure 9.2.1, Table \n9.2.1) fall into one of two soil associations, namely those in: \n1. Areas on flood plains dominated by nearly level soils; and those in  \n2. Areas on uplands dominated by unstable soils over chalk. The former is \ncomprised of the Leeper-Marietta-Catalpa association while the latter is \nmade up of the Kipling-Savannah-Oktibbeha association. Together they \noccupy nearly 20,000 acres or 70% of the watershed.  \nThe Leeper-Marietta-Catalpa association formed in recent alkaline, clayey alluvium \nderived from Prairie Bluff and Demopolis materials, and in mixed loamy and clayey, \nslightly acid to alkaline, recent prairie and Ripley coastal plain uplands. Both Leeper and \nCatalpa soils have significant shrink-swell properties and are somewhat poorly to \nmoderately well-drained. The Marietta soils are moderately well drained. Flooding limits \nthe use of some of the members of this association to some extent, but where there is \ndrainage some of the largest farms in the watershed are in this association. The Kipling-\nSavannah-Oktibbeha association occurs on gently sloping ridgetops and moderately steep \nside slopes. It is composed of somewhat poorly to moderately well drained soils that \ndeveloped from the chalk of the Prairie Bluff and Demopolis formations. Kipling soils are \non ridgetops and sideslopes and have clayey subsoils, while Oktibbeha, also with clayey \nsubsoils are on knoll-shaped ridgetops. Savannah soils occur on narrow ridgetops and \nhave fragipans. The farms of this association are larger than the average for the \nwatershed. Mississippi State University is located primarily in the Kipling-Savannah-\nOktibbeha association. Erosion is a hazard on the ridgetops.  \ny = 105.35x\nR\n2\n = 0.65\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n01020304050\nMillions\nThousands\nWatershed Area (km\n2\n)\nAnnual Total Sediment Load (Mg yr\n-1\n)\n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   28 \n \nThe distribution of land use capability ratings for members of both soil associations is \nshown in Figure 9.2.2 and Table 9.2.2. Land capability class provides a general indicator of \nthe suitability of soils for most kinds of field crops. There are eight classes and range from \nI, which has few limitations restricting use to VIII, which has limitations precluding their \nuse for commercial plant production. Almost 50 percent of the major soils in the \nwatershed are in class II and III, and require moderate to special conservation practices in \norder to avoid the risk of damage to them. \nAvailable water capacity (AWC) ratings are shown in Figure 9.2.3 and Table 9.2.3. A soil \ndepth of 12 inches (30.5 cm) with an AWC rating of 0.11 cm water/cm soil holds 3.4 cm of \nwater available for plant use. As a comparison, 30.5 cm of a soil with an AWC of 0.2 cm \nwater/cm soil can hold 6.1 cm of available water. For a daily evapotranspiration demand \nof 0.28 cm, the higher AWC can provide 22 days of moisture to plants as compared to 12 \nfor the lower one. Drainage classes for the predominant soil associations are shown in \nFigure 9.2.4 and Table 9.2.4. Moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained map \nunits are roughly equal in terms of spatial extent. The Leeper unit, which falls into the \nhighest land capability class in the watershed was formed under wet conditions, which \ncan become drainage issues when under cultivation. Conversely, the moderately well \ndrained Oktibbeha units on 8-17 per cent slopes have severe restrictions due to \nsteepness. \nTable 9.2.1.

There are several sources of viable real-time and \nhistorical precipitation data for the Catalpa Creek watershed, including both surface \ngauge observations and radar-based estimates.  Available surface observations include: \n(1) a National Weather Service (NWS) cooperative observer (COOP) gauge, which has a \nperiod of record of Sep. 1, 1891 - present, and (2) a USDA Soil Climate Analysis Network \n(SCAN) site with a period of record of Apr. 21, 2002 – present.  Radar-based precipitation \nestimates are from the NWS NEXRAD product, and have a period of record of Apr. 1, \n1996 – present.  Details and descriptions of the various precipitation data sources are \nincluded in Table 9.3.1. \nAn analysis of bias between the various data sources was conducted by Dyer (2009), with \nresults showing that the surface gauge and radar-based precipitation estimates are \ncomparable and can be used interchangeable with minimal statistical error.  For analysis \nof precipitation patterns over the Catalpa Creek watershed, data from the NWS \ncooperative observer gauge were used since it provides the longest period of record.  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   32 \n \nHowever, due to missing data issues and to focus the analysis on recent historical \npatterns, the period of analysis was limited to Jan. 1, 1948 – Dec. 31, 2014. \nTable 9.3.1. Overview of Available Precipitation Data Sources over the Catalpa Creek Watershed. \n \n \nAnnual Precipitation Patterns.  Based on cumulative annual precipitation values derived \nfrom daily estimates from the NWS cooperative gauge, Catalpa Creek watershed receives \nan average of 1,378 mm of precipitation per year (standard deviation of 301 mm).  \nDespite a considerable range in annual precipitation, the data show a relatively stable \npattern with no significant trend.  A frequency analysis of cumulative annual \nprecipitation shows that the values are generally normally distributed, with no \nstatistically significant outliers (Figure 9.3.1).  As such, annual precipitation estimates \nusing the mean/standard deviation values described above can be considered viable for \nfurther near-future hydrologic analysis and design. \n \nFigure 9.3.1.

Seasonal precipitation patterns were analyzed by \naccumulating precipitation records over four three-month seasons from 1948 - 2014: \nWinter (Jan.-Mar.), spring (Apr.-Jun.), summer (Jul.-Sep.), fall (Oct.-Dec.) (Table 9.3.2).  \nIn general, winter has the highest average precipitation (406 mm) and summer has the \nlowest (293 mm); however, summer has the highest variability (standard deviation of \n129 mm), indicating that seasonal means are not indicative of near-future water \navailability. Seasonal time series (Figure 9.3.2) indicate that although some years show \nshared high/low precipitation in adjacent seasons, there is generally no visible \nconsistency between seasons and precipitation depth.  As such, cumulative precipitation \nfrom one season cannot be reliably used to predict precipitation for a subsequent \nseason – in other words, a wet summer does not necessarily imply a wet winter.  The \nhigh variability of convective rainfall makes seasonal prediction extremely difficult.  As \nsuch, defining future seasonal rainfall values inherently includes a substantial degree of \nuncertainty. \n \nFigure 9.3.2.

Analysis of monthly average precipitation values using \nthe NWS COOP gauge data from 1948-2014 (not including 1998-1999 due to missing \ndata) show additional detail regarding the seasonal variability of precipitation over the \nCatalpa Creek watershed.  In general, March is the wettest month (average = 147 mm) \nand October is the driest month (average = 84 mm) (Figure 9.3.3).  The average monthly \nprecipitation is 117 mm, with a standard deviation of 21.4 mm.  Moving into the spring, \nalthough it is possible for an area to receive a substantial amount of precipitation, it will \nlikely have a short duration and a long return interval.  The more probable scenario over \nthis type of environment is a small probability of convective rainfall for each day (~10%-\n20%), with a high precipitation rate when rainfall does occur.  This is based on typical \nconditions for a humid subtropical environment and air mass thunderstorm potential. \n \nFigure 9.3.3. Monthly average precipitation based on the NWS COOP  \nsurface gauge data (1948-2012; excluding 1998-1999). \nFuture Precipitation Scenarios.  Information on future precipitation scenarios is based \non results from a government report that was submitted as part of the U.S. National \nClimate Assessment (Kunkel et al., 2013).  This report summarizes the output from \nglobal climate models and statistically downscaled regional climate projections from \nphase 3 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP3) as well as dynamically \ndownscaled output from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment \nProgram (NARCCAP).  These models are driven largely by projected CO\n2\n concentrations.  \nTwo scenarios are presented whereby CO\n2 \nemissions (1) continually rise (A2) or (2) \nincrease but gradually level off (B1).  The spatial resolution of the models used in this \nanalysis ranges from 50-175 km, which provides some general insight into projected \nconditions across northeast MS that may be applicable to the smaller Catalpa Creek \nwatershed.  More information on these model datasets can be found in Kunkel et al. \n(2013).  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   35 \n \nFigure 9.3.4 shows the \npercent change in annual \nprecipitation (with \nrespect to the base \nperiod 1971-1999) across \nthe Southeast U.S. based \non the mean output from \nall CMIP3 models for each \nof the future time periods \nmentioned above.  The \nmulti-model means for \nboth the A2 and B1 \nscenarios suggest an \noverall decrease in annual \nprecipitation across \nnortheast MS of up to 3% \nthroughout the first half \nof the 21\nst\n century.  \nHowever, it should be \nnoted these projections \nare smaller than typical \nyear-to-year variations \nseen in the observed \nrecord.  Moreover, there \nis disagreement among \nthe emissions scenarios \nover the direction of the \nchange in annual \nprecipitation by the end \nof the 21\nst\n century; under \nthe A2 scenario, most \nmodels project a \nstatistically significant \ndecrease in annual \nprecipitation across the region encompassing the Catalpa Creek watershed, while an \nincrease in precipitation is suggested under the B1 scenario.  When examined by season, \nthe greatest increases are expected during winter and spring, while summertime \nprecipitation is expected to decrease by up to 5% (Figure 9.3.5). However, these changes \nare not statistically significant from the 1971-2000 base period.  The annual number of \ndays with extreme precipitation (>1 inch), as well as the number of consecutive dry \ndays, are both expected\n\n to increase across northeast MS by mid-century, though these \nFigure 9.3.4.

(2013). \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   36 \n \nchanges are not statistically significant (Figure 9.3.6).  It is important to note that \nindividual model ranges from both the CMIP3 and NARCCAP are rather large compared \nto the multi-model means, indicating that there is considerable uncertainty in both \nannual and seasonal precipitation projections across the region by the end of the 21\nst\n \ncentury.   \n \nFigure 9.3.5.

Catalpa Creek is a HUC-12 watershed (031601040603; \nMWS #8090). Catalpa Creek is part of the Tombigbee River Basin (Figure 9.4.1). \nCatalpa Creek is the major drainage systems for 5.1 mi\n2\n of the MSU campus and \nsurrounding areas.  This large drainage area combined with the confined nature of the \nchannel, results in this system’s having extremely high flows during storm events.  High \nflows from campus have become quite noticeable to administration, and impoundments \nhave been included in the MSU Master Plan (MSU, 2010), presented in Section 11.3, near \nthe headwaters to remediate this issue.  It is currently uncertain if planned \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   38 \n \nimpoundments are designed based on engineered surveys and will meet size \nrequirements to capture runoff during extreme events. Also, no timeline for \nimplementation has yet been indicated. \n \nFigure 9.4.1. Hydrologic Features of the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed. \nA morphometric characterization of the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed is presented \nin Table 9.4.1. The watershed is a fifth-order, with a low bifurcation ratio (3.5), which is an \nindication that the geological structures are less disturbing to the drainage pattern (Table \n9.4.2). A moderate number of streams (159 streams) is observed within the watershed \narea, reflecting a stream frequency of about 1 stream segment per each 0.3 mi\n2\n. Along \nwith the stream frequency, the drainage density (3.34 mi/mi\n2\n) and the stream intensity \n(11.75) are indicators of a moderately well drained watershed in terms of the spatial \ndistribution of the stream’s network. The magnitude of the asymmetric index (1.02) is \nevidence that the hydrologic contribution from each one of the two areas created by \ndividing the watershed along the main channel is relatively homogeneous. However, the \nupper part of the watershed, right before the main stream joins to the biggest northern \ntributary, has significantly higher differences in the areal distribution, with the main \nstream lying along the southern area of the subwatershed. The magnitudes of the form \nfactor (0.22) elongation ratio (0.25), and compactness ratio (1.76), correspond to an \noblong rectangular watershed that will have flatter peaks of flow for longer duration. The \nmain channel has a very gentle slope (0.14%). Table 9.4.1 presents the profile along the \nentire 14.2 miles of the main stream. Mean elevations along the main channel range from \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   39 \n \n194 ft to 352 ft. The main channel slopes are very flat and three main segments with \nvariations in slope are observed. Along the headwaters and the South Farm (<4.2 mi), the \naverage slope was 0.0024 ft/ft (0.24%); the following 7.5 miles present an average slope \nof 0.012 ft/ft (0.12%), while the lower part of the main channel (>11.86 mi) presents a \nmean slope of 0.0004 ft/ft (0.04%). \nTable 9.4.1.

A USGS Station (02441300) is located along the Catalpa Creek at \nMayhew, MS. However, it is located around 5 miles downstream of the outlet of the area \nof study, and its flow discharge represents the hydrologic response for an area of 98 mi\n2\n. \nAt this site, the annual peak flow discharge and stage information dates from 1964, but \nthe daily stage and flow time series exist only since September 2014 ( Figure 9.4.4). Using \nthe USGS PeakFQ software, a bankfull discharge of 5,330 ft\n3\n/s was estimated from the \nfrequency curve of the station (Figure 9.4.5).   \n \nFigure 9.4.5. Frequency Curve for the Catalpa Creek at the 02441300 USGS \nStation in Mayhew, MS located 5 km downstream from the outlet  \nof Red Bud - Catalpa Creek Watershed. \nDue to the lack of streamflow information, studies completed by MSU researchers to \ndevelop a water and a sediment budget along the Tombigbee River Basin are used as a \nreference to approximate the hydrologic response for the Red Bud - Catalpa Creek \nWatershed. Considering the relationships between drainage area and mean daily \ndischarge (Figure 9.4.6), and between drainage area and bankfull discharge (assumed as \nthe streamflow at a recurrence interval of 1.5 years (Q\n1.5\n)) (Figure 9.4.7), generated by \nRamirez-Avila et al.

The Gordo aquifer is the primary groundwater source of in the Red Bud \n- Catalpa Creek Watershed and is used for public water supplies and for domestic and \nfarm wells in the area. Generally, the Gordo aquifer is capable of yielding greater \nquantities of water than the overlying Eutaw-McShan aquifer.  \nThe Gordo Formation is a part of the Tuscaloosa Group of Upper Cretaceous age and \nincludes the Gordo and Coker Formations. The Gordo is overlapped by the McShan and \nEutaw Formations and is underlain by Paleozoic rocks in the north and by the Coker \nFormation to the south (Boswell, 1978). The Gordo is composed of sediments ranging \nfrom an upper unit composed mostly of clay and fine sand to a lower unit in which \ncoarse quartz sand and chert gravel predominate.  This lower unit comprises the Gordo \naquifer. The Gordo Formation is less than 30 feet thick in Prentiss County and thickens \nto about 400 feet in Oktibbeha and Kemper Counties (Boswell, 1963). Regionally, the \nGordo Formation thins to the north and northwest. \nRecharge to the Gordo aquifer is primarily by precipitation on the outcrop near the \nMississippi – Alabama border. Water moves southwestward in the subsurface from the \noutcrop areas (Boswell, 1978).   \nPublic Water Supplies.  Figure 9.4.8 delineates the certificated areas of the community \nwater systems within the watershed. \n \nFigure 9.4.8. Public Water Supply Certificated Areas. \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   44 \n \nWithin these areas, there are twelve (12) active public water supply wells in the \nwatershed – three in Lowndes County and nine in Oktibbeha County (Table 9.4.3). \nTable 9.4.3. Public Water Supply Wells in the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed. \nWELL ID PWS WELL DEPTH (FT) WELL GPM \n440097-1 South Lowndes W/A 889 230 \n440001-3 Town of Artesia 1,030 216 \n440001-4 Town of Artesia 1,050 210 \n530019-1 Sessums W/A 1,231 160 \n530019-2 Sessums W/A 1,406 200 \n530024-2 Turkey Creek W/A 1,395 250 \n530012-2 Miss State University 1,430 1,000 \n530012-3 Miss State University 1,431 931 \n530012-4 Miss State University 1,341 1,200 \n530012-5 Miss State University 1,405 1,242 \n530002-2 Black Jack W/A 1,240 205 \n530002-3 Black Jack W/A 1,401 150 \n \nThe average well depth is 1,271 feet with a maximum well depth of 1,431 feet and a \nminimum well depth of 889 feet.  The average gallons per minute (gpm) is 500 gpm with a \nmaximum gpm of 1,242 and a minimum gpm of 150.  The combined potential \ngroundwater withdrawal is 5,994 gpm. \nThe majority of the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed is covered by public water supply \ncertificated areas.  Thus most residents living in the watershed are on a community water \nsystem and not on a private well.  The watershed is approximately 73% in Oktibbeha \nCounty and 27% in Lowndes County.  If there was an equal geographic distribution of \nprivate well owners in each county, the Oktibbeha County portion of the watershed \nwould have between 213 and 700 private well residents and the Lowndes County portion \nof the watershed would have between 0 and 195 private well residents. \n9.5 LAND USE  \n \nThe majority (44%) of the land use in the watershed is in hay production/pasture land, 2% \nis forested, shrub, and herbaceous land, while 10% is in cultivated crops, 8% is wetlands \nor open water, and 9% is developed land (Figure 9.5.1). Since 2001 there has been a loss \nof 51 acres of pasture land/hay production, a loss of 49 acres in cultivated crops, an \nincrease in developed land by 21 acres, no change in open water or wetlands, and \nincrease in forested, shrub, and herbaceous land by 79 acres (Figure 9.5.2).\n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   45 \n \n \n \nFigure 9.5.1.

Geologic formations of the Selma Group dominate the \nunderlying parent material of the physiographic regions in the Catalpa Creek \nwatershed. The Prairie Bluff Chalk, Ripley, and Demopolis Chalk formations are Late \nCretaceous deposits associated with the Black Prairie and Pontotoc Ridge \nphysiographic regions. The headwaters of Catalpa Creek, at the western edge of the \nwatershed, are associated with soils derived from the Prairie Bluff chalk. Eastward of \nthe headwaters are the Ripley and Demopolis formations, which are characteristic of \nthe prairie soils and plant communities described in historic accounts of the region. \nA comprehensive early description of the plant communities of the watershed comes \nfrom the original surveys of the General Land Office in the 1830s (Figure 9.6.1). These \nsurveys laid out townships and described the potential productivity of the natural \nresources seen along the section lines. The section descriptions were aggregated into \ntownship plat maps showing river courses and floodplains, tributary streams, and in \nthe case of Northeast Mississippi, the location of prairie openings within the forest \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   47 \n \nthat generally dominated the landscape. Five of these prairies were described nearest \nthe northern ridge/boundary of the watershed, the largest being approximately one \nsquare mile (640 acres) in size. Another large prairie was seen in the geographic \ncenter of the watershed, between Red Bud and Catalpa Creeks. Two smaller prairies \nwere described in the southeastern corner of the watershed.  \n \nEarly descriptions of the “northeastern Prairie Belt” and “Pontotoc Ridge” \nphysiographic regions describe a gently undulating landscape of forest interspersed \nwith patches of prairie or prairie interspersed with patches of forest, depending on \nwhere one found himself (Lowe, 1921). Lowe (1921) listed grass species from \nOktibbeha County as Andropogon scoparius (now Schyzachirium scoparius), A. \nglomeratus, A. virginicus, A. elliotii, A. sericeus (now Dichanthium sericeum), A. \nfurcatus (now A. gerardii), Erianthus tracyi, E. saccharoides, E. brevibarbis, E. smallii, \nand Tripsacum dactyloides. Common forbs listed included the genera Coreopsis, \nAsclepias, Petalostemon (now Dalea), Silphium, Rudbeckia, and Liatris, which are all \ncommon species in modern prairie remnants. Characteristic prairie woodland \nspecies listed by Lowe include 5 species of Quercus, Carya tomentosa (mockernut \nhickory, listed as Hickoria alba), Pinus echinata, and Diospyros virginiana. Lowe’s \ncharacterization of the Pontotoc Ridge is distinct and describes the region primarily \nas seen to the north of the Red Bud - Catalpa Creek watershed. He describes a region \nFigure 9.6.1. General Land Office (GLO) plat maps associated with the Catalpa Creek Watershed.  \nThe watershed boundary is shown in blue. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   48 \n \nthat, south of Union County, is “less sandy, richer, and the hills less broken.” \nDominant trees listed for the southern area of the region included 6 species of \nQuercus, Liquidambar styraciflua, Juglans nigra, Acer rubrum, Gleditsia triacanthos, \nand Liriodendron tulipifera. \nMore recent classification of the Prairie systems in NatureServe include Blackbelt \nPrairie Herbaceous Vegetation (an association of Schyzachirium scoparium-\nSorghastrum nutans-Dalea candida-Liatris squarrosa), Blackbelt woodland (a \nQuercus stellata-Quercus muehlenbergii/Schyzachirium scoparium-Sorghastrum \nnutans association), and Cedar woodland (a Juniperus virginiana var. virginiana with \nCeltis laevigata-Prunus angustifolia-Sideroxylon lycioides association (NatureServe, \n2015). Leidolf et al. (2002) described 16 plant communities from 5 broader \ncategories, summarized in Table 9.6.1. The descriptions included are applicable in \nthe Catalpa Creek watershed with the exception of the communities associated with \nthe Flatwoods physiographic region, which is not represented in the watershed. \nNatureServe does not have any classification of the Pontotoc Ridge. \nTable 9.6.1. Classification of Plant Communities by Leidolf et al. (2002). \nHABITAT CATEGORY COMMUNITY TYPE \nBottomland Forest Bottomland Hardwood Forest \nSwamp Forest \nUpland Forest and Prairie Mesophytic Upland Hardwood Forest \nXeric Upland Hardwood Forest \nPine Forest and Pine/Mixed Hardwood Forest \nPrairi\n\ne \nPrairie Cedar Woodland \nChalk Outcrops \nAquatic Communities Rivers/Creeks \nCanals/Drainage Ditches \nLakes/Ponds/Impoundments \nSeepage Areas  \nHuman-influenced Communities Cultivated Fields \nGrass/Forb Meadows \nRoadsides \nUrban Areas \n \nDisturbance patterns.  Historic disturbance patterns in the Catalpa Creek watershed \ninclude row-crop and grazing agriculture, development, and fragmentation leading \nto the loss of the frequent fire regime that kept prairies clear of dominance by \nwoody tree species. In the absence of fire, prairie habitat has an increased \nabundance of Juniperus virginiana and other calciphile woody species. There is very \nlittle evidence that prescribed burning or fire management is being used to manage \nthe prairie resources of the watershed. The agricultural heritage of the watershed \nincludes a significant dairy industry that has decreased in recent years, mirroring a \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   49 \n \nstatewide decline of 65% from 1990-2006 (Philips, 2007), with only one commercial \ndairy in operation in Oktibbeha County, down from almost 1000 in the early 20\nth\n \ncentury (Brandon, 2011). Many of the former dairy operations have converted to \nbeef cattle production, and 44% of the land area in the watershed is currently \ndedicated to pasture or hay systems (Figure 9.5.1). Another 10% of the land area in \nthe watershed is under cultivation (Figure 9.5.1). Numerous NRCS programs are \navailable to farmers in the area to mitigate the impacts of farming operations. \nQuantification of remnant forest stands. Changes in land use have impacted the \nhistoric forest communities of the watershed, as evidenced by the legacy of the Giles \nBur Oak Preserve on the South Farm adjacent to the campus of Mississippi State \nUniversity. Established in May of 1968, the W.L. Giles Bur Oak Preserve consists of \ntwo small rectangular forest patches adjacent to Catalpa Creek that are surrounded \nby cattle pasture on Mississippi State University’s H.H. Leveck Animal Research \nCenter (Figure 9.6.2). The southern unit is 3.39 acres, whereas the northern unit is \n0.64 acres.  The forest within the preserve is typical of alluvial forests in the Black \nBelt Prairie physiographic region, and contain several species of note, including bur \noaks (Quercus macrocarpa), Ohio buckeye (Aesculus glabra) Durand oak (Quercus \nsinuata), and nutmeg hickory (Carya myristiciformis). The preserve was originally \nestablished to honor then-MSU president Dr. William Giles who is credited with \ndiscovering the trees in Mississippi, and to protect the population of bur oaks, which \nare ranked as S2 on the Mississippi Natural Heritage Program’s State Special Plants \nTracking List, meaning that they are imperiled in the state due to rarity (6 to 20 \noccurrences or few remaining individuals or acres. \nInitially, both sections of the preserve were fenced and identified by signs.  In the \nyears since, the signs have disappeared, the fence around the northern section has \nbeen removed, and the south unit has been overrun with Chinese privet (Ligustrum \nsinense).  In 2013, efforts to revitalize interest in the preserve was initiated. The \nfencing was repaired around the southern section, new signage was established, and \nan inventory of the woody vegetation was conducted (Table 9.6.2 and Table 9.6.3), \nand a survey of the ant fauna of both sections of the preserve (Table 12.2.1) was \ninitiated.  \nThe inventory of the woody (not including privet) documented thirty-four tree \nspecies with hackberry (Celtis laevigata) being the most abundant species in both \nsections.  Sixty-six bur oaks are currently protected within the preserve boundaries, \nwhich represents the largest protected population in the state.  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   50 \n \n \nFigure 9.6.2.

Mississippi State University has more than \n2,200 acres of crop and grazing lands adjacent to campus comprised of the North \n(R.R. Foil Research Center) and South (Leveck Animal Research Center) Farm. The \nlargest contiguous acreage on campus is the 1,500 acres of the South Farm. Catalpa \nCreek and several of its tributaries carry drainage and significant amounts of \nstormwater south then east from campus. Part of the acreage of the South Farm is \ndevoted to animal, forage breeding and forage/animal management research, \nhowever, more than half of the acreage of the South Farm is to devoted forage \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   54 \n \nproduction and grazing. While the administration has worked to limit animal waste \ndeposition near the creek, additional improvements could be made.   \nResearch has shown planting and limited mowing of warm season (switchgrass, \nindiangrass, big bluestem, gamagrass and prairie cordgrass) and cool season \n(rivercane) native grasses and associated forbs in the riparian zone intercepts \nsurface nutrients and organic detritus. Additionally, these grasses by virtue of their \ndeep-rooted nature and rhizome network (in the case of rivercane and prairie \ncordgrass) reduce bank sloughing and erosion orders of magnitude better than the \ncurrent bermudagrass/fescue planting.   This mixed planting of these grasses \nencourages faunal populations. Nesting of migratory songbirds, habitat for \npollinators and shelter for small mammals all benefit from planting mixed native \ngrass populations.   \nPursuit of management systems that limit tillage on hillier portions (2.5 and 5.0 acre \nresearch pastures) would significantly maintain soil fertility and reduce erosion.  \nAdditionally, minor changes in the course of road drainage ditches by diverting them \ninto the pastures would capture silt and substantially reduce erosion of the road-\nside ditches. \nTurf Health and Associated Best Management Practices.  There are approximately \n300 acres of mown turf on the Mississippi State University Campus – 50 acres of \nwhich are fertilized. Approximately 25 acres are frequently irrigated, predominantly \n“the Junction” and adjacent areas where game-day traffic requires supplemental \nfertility and irrigation in order to achieve recuperative capacity and the desired \naesthetic qualities commissioned by University administration.   \nSouth of Blackjack Road, there are fewer than 20 acres of fertilized turf – mainly \nintramural fields and landscaping near the Vet School structure and parking lots.  \nFive acres are the football practice and intramural fields west of South Farm Road. \n11 acres are softball/baseball intramural fields. Twenty-five acres are mixed use \n(parking and lawn) present on the Vet School campus abutting Blackjack. Five acres \nare utility right of way on the east side of Catalpa Creek nearest the entrance off \nBlackjack. Approximately 30 acres of unimproved road right-of-way exist on South \nFarm. This acreage is mown fewer than three times per year. Clippings are left \nremaining and not harvested for hay. \nBest management of turf requires understanding the utilization of turf areas. For \ninstance, turf areas used as game-day parking require increased inputs – \npredominantly supplemental fertility. Areas that are utility (e.g., gas, electric, sewer, \nwater) and roadside right-of-way require only mowing and infrequent herbicide \napplication to reduce mowing frequency (also known as “chemical mowing”). \nApplication of management practices for turf is further described in Section 11. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   55 \n \nInvasive Species and Their Impact on Plant Community Development in the \nWatershed.  The Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS, ND) \nindicates that Oktibbeha County has the third highest number of reported invasive \nspecies in the state of Mississippi, with 217 reported invasive species.  \nOf the “10 Worst Invasive Weeds” listed by the Mississippi State University \nExtension Service, four upland invasive species are of particular concern: Triadica \nsebifera (Chinese Tallow tree), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle), Ligustrum \nsinense (Chinese privet), and Sorghum halapense (johnsongrass). All of these are \npresent on the MSU South Farm. Chinese privet and johnsongrass are abundant in \nthe streams in the headwaters of Catalpa Creek (Chinese tallowtree and Japanese \nhoneysuckle are also present, but not abundant). The impact of privet and \njohnsongrass is primarily that of replacement of native species in the riparian zone, \nbut on a positive note they are of value to the managers of South Farm for erosion \navoidance on the banks of the channelized reaches of the stream on South Farm and \nat the MSU Dairy Unit near Sessums. Care will have to be taken to manage the \ninvasive species while at the same time not exposing the banks of the channel to \nfurther erosion.  \nThe wetland invasive species are of primary concern in the lower reaches of the \nwatershed as Catalpa Creek approaches its confluence with Tibbee Creek in Lowndes \nCounty. Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife), Alternanthera philoxeroides (Alligator \nweed), and Eichornia crassipes (water hyacinth) are all present in Lowndes and \nOktibbeha counties (EDDMapS, ND). \n9.7 DEMOGRAPHICS   \n \nThe Catalpa – Red Bud Creek Watershed is located in Lowndes and Oktibbeha \ncounties in Mississippi. According to the Annual Estimates of Residents Population \nReport generated by the US Census Bureau from the 2010 Census results (Table 9.7.1, \nFigure 9.7.1), the estimated population in the watershed area in April 2014 was 5,126 \npeople, which represented around the 4.5% of the total population of both counties. \nThe 72.5% of the watershed population is established in Oktibbeha County. \nCombining sources of information, the estimated population in the watershed in 2014 \nhas increased almost 20% during the last 24 years, 9.5% since 2000, and 2.6% since \n2010.  \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   56 \n \nTable 9.7.1.

Restoration and protection activities will also be useful for \ndemonstration, education and research. All of these activities are consistent with the \npurpose and function of a research university such as Mississippi State University.  \nWatershed restoration and protection will be achieved while demonstrating and \npromoting compatibility with sustainable agricultural production, effectively \naddressing storm water management, and fostering the implementation of green \ninfrastructure (GI) and low impact development (LID) principles. The Catalpa Creek \nWatershed and, specifically, the South Farm provides a unique opportunity to \ndemonstrate and promote sustainable agriculture with its approximately 1,600 acres \nused for cattle, equine and poultry management research as well as the NRCS Grazing \nLands Conservation Initiative demonstration site, 18 acres of aquaculture ponds, and \nvarious water quality research projects. Likewise, ample opportunities exist for \neffective storm water management and fostering GI and LID principles as called for \nand identified in MSU’s Master Plan (MSU, 2010).  \nOne critical aspect of the plan is the design and implementation of specific \nmanagement actions (Section 11).  A second critical aspect is the identification of \nmeasureable targets or metrics that may be used to determine whether these \nmanagement actions were successful (or not). The focus here will be on three specific \nindicators of success: \n Water Quality; \n Habitat Quality/Ecosystem Function; and \n Social Indicators. \n \nIn 2000, EPA released its guiding principles for restoration and protection to provide \na framework for effective management (Table 10.1.1).  \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   59 \n \nTable 10.1.1.

In 1972, the Clean Water Act (CWA) established the \nnational goal “to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity \nof the Nation’s waters.” The CWA then defined water quality in terms of chemical, \nphysical and biologic integrity.  In order to promulgate regulations to meet the \nobjectives of the CWA, the challenge of developing well-defined and enforceable \nmetrics and operational conditions had to be met. These metrics and conditions then \ncould be used to both assess the condition of the nation’s waters and determine \nwhen the objectives of the CWA were accomplished. As such, a fundamental provision \nof the Clean Water Act (CWA, section 304(a)(1)), and amendments, was the \nrequirement that states develop water quality standards for waterbodies. Water \nquality standards are the foundation of our nation’s water quality-based management \nprograms.  These standards will be used to determine the success of the restoration \nand protection efforts for the Catalpa Creek watershed project.  \nA water quality standard is applied to a specific waterbody (e.g., Catalpa Creek), not \nto a discharge, and contain three basic elements. \n Classification system (in Mississippi, Fish & Wildlife, Shellfish Harvesting, \nRecreation, Public Water Supply, or Ephemeral Streams) that is associated \nwith a similar US EPA designated use;  \n Numeric criteria protective of each water body classification and designated \nuse; and \n Anti-degradation policies. \n \nWater Body Classification and Designated Uses.  The water body use classification \nestablished by MDEQ for Catalpa Creek is Fish and Wildlife Use. These waters are \nintended for fishing and for propagation of fish, aquatic life, and wildlife. Waters that \nmeet the Fish and Wildlife criteria shall also be suitable for secondary contact \nrecreation. Secondary contact recreation is defined as incidental contact with the \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   60 \n \nwater during activities such as wading, fishing, and boating, that are not likely to \nresult in full body immersion. \nThis classification specifies numeric criteria for bacteria (summer and winter values), \nspecific conductance, dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and toxic \nsubstances (Table 10.2.1). Presently narrative standards apply to other pollutants. \n(See State of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria For Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal \nWaters (MDEQ, 2012). \nThe State of Mississippi classification of Fish and Wildlife Use has the associated US \nEPA designated uses of Aquatic Life Use, Fish Consumption and Secondary Contact \nRecreation. \nTable 10.2.1. MDEQ Water Quality Standards Applicable to Catalpa Creek for Selected Parameters. \nPARAMETER CRITERIA \nSediment/Siltation Narrative Standard: Waters shall be free from materials attributable to \nmunicipal, industrial, agricultural, or other dischargers producing color, \nodor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, sediment, turbidity, or \nother conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the waters \ninjurious to public health, recreation, or to aquatic life and wildlife, or \nadversely affect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the \nwaters for any designated uses. \nNutrients Same as above \nFecal Coliform May - October: Fecal coliform colony counts not to exceed a geometric \nmean of 200 per 100ml based on a minimum of 5 samples taken over a 30-\nday period with no less than 12 hours between individual samples, nor shall \nthe samples examined during a 30-day period exceed 400 per 100ml more \nthan 10% of the time. \nNovember – April: Fecal coliform colony counts shall not exceed a geometric \nmean of 2000 per 100 ml based on a minimum of 5 samples taken over a \n30-day period with no less than 12 hours between individual samples, nor \nshall the samples examined during a 30-day period exceed 4000 per 100 ml \nmore than 10% of the time. \n \n \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   61 \n \nWater Quality Monitoring. Water quality in Catalpa Creek is periodically sampled by \nthe MDEQ at four Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) locations (Figure 10.2.1): \n Upstream of Oktoc Road on Catalpa Creek; \n Sessums Road on Catalpa Creek; \n At Artesia 200 M upstream of Hwy 45 (upstream of Artesia POTW outfall); and \n Upstream of Artesia Road (downstream of Artesia POTW outfall).  \n \nMDEQ uses an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to assess the degree of human \ndisturbance on streams and rivers, based on the original definition of biological \nintegrity and multi-metric index developed by Karr (1981).  The IBI used by MDEQ is \nbased on a benthic index of invertebrate aquatic species and is referred to as M-\nBISQ, the Mississippi Benthic Index of Stream Quality. The M-BISQ is based on an \naggregation of biometrics in order to establish scores that may be used to assess the \noverall ecological condition of sites, as well as contributing to evaluation of the \neffects of nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, habitat impairment, and land use \nconversions (MDEQ, 2003). It also may be used in establishing restoration and \nremediation goals, tracking the effectiveness of restoration and remediation \nactivities, and developing watershed management strategies (MDEQ, 2003). \nThe data that have come from this monitoring show that Catalpa Creek has an \nimpairment. The stressor identification process determined that the cause of the \nimpairment is sediment. \nSince Catalpa Creek does not meet water quality criteria, a Total Maximum Daily \nLoad (TMDL) study was conducted for the sediment impairment. The State of \nMississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters \nregulation does not include a numerical water quality standard for aquatic life \nprotection due to sediment (MDEQ, 2012); however, the narrative standard for the \nprotection of aquatic life is sufficient for justification of TMDL development, \nalthough it does not provide a quantifiable TMDL target (numeric limit for \nsediment). Therefore, the target for this TMDL is based on reference sediment yields \ndeveloped by the Channel and Watershed Processes Research Unit (CWPRU) at the \nUSDA Agricultural Research Service’s National Sedimentation Laboratory (NSL). \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   62 \n \n \nFigure 10.2.1. Map of IBI Sites Related to the Catalpa Creek Watershed. \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   63 \n \nNPDES Permits.  The CWA also established the National Pollutant Discharge \nElimination System (NPDES) permit program that mitigates water pollution by \nregulating all point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the United \nStates. A point source is a discharge from a discrete conveyance such as a pipe or \nditch. MDEQ implements the program by establishing Waste Load Allocations (WLA) \nbased on an allowable load that will not result in impairments (not meeting water \nquality standards), and issuing NPDES discharge permits.  \nThere are 7 sites in the watershed that have NPDES permits. These are facilities that \nhave a permit that specifies the conditions under which they may discharge treated \nwastewater back into the environment—in this case into Catalpa Creek. There are \nno pending complaints and no enforcement actions in effect by MDEQ at the time of \nthis writing. \nTwo sites on the South Farm with NPDES permits are the MSU Poultry Science \nResearch Center and the MSU Ag Center and Horse Park.  \nTotal Maximum Daily Loads. A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is the maximum \namount of a pollutant that can exist within a body of water and the waterbody is still \nable to meet its water quality standards. Excess levels of a pollutant may come from \nwaste water that is discharged into the waterbody, or from diverse sources picked \nup by stormwater as it flows over the landscape, or from the natural background \namount that occurs in the landscape. Pollution from diverse sources is known as \nnonpoint source (NPS) pollution. A TMDL is essentially a “pollution budget” designed \nto restore the health of the polluted body of water by setting the maximum amount \nthat is allowed from all sources.  \nFor waterbodies, which after implementation of the waste load allocations for all \nthe NPDES dischargers in the watershed, are still not meeting water quality \nstandards (i. e., are impaired), a state must then determine the TMDL allowable, and \nimplement plans to remove the impairment. In this sense, a TMDL is the total \nallowable maximum daily load that would attain and maintain water quality \nstandards, stated in formula as,  \n푇푀퐷퐿=퐿퐶= \n∑\n푊퐿퐴+ \n∑\n퐿퐴+푀푂푆, \nwhere 퐿퐶 is the load capacity or waste assimilative capacity of the water body, \n∑\n푊퐿퐴 is the sum of all waste load allocations for the point sources discharged into \nthe water body, \n∑\n퐿퐴 is the sum of all load allocations for the nonpoint sources \nentering the water body, and 푀푂푆 is the margin of safety. \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   64 \n \n10.3 CATALPA CREEK WATER QUALITY \n \nWhere does the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed rank in terms of water quality \nwithin the Tibbee Creek Watershed and Tombigbee River Basin?  MDEQ has \ndeveloped a tool for characterizing and ranking watersheds against each other, within \na watershed, or within a basin. This tool, known as the Mississippi Watershed \nCharacterization and Ranking Tool (MWCRT) is used to help guide selection of \nwatershed projects by the agency. The major data components used for ranking \nconsist of resource value (environmental and human welfare) and potential stressors \nsuch as lack of riparian zone, erosion potential index, impervious surface, and others. \nMWCRT ranked the Red Bud—Catalpa Creek Watershed as follows:  \nStressor Potential    High \nHuman Welfare Value       Low \nEnvironmental Resource Value  Medium \nThis means that when compared to other watersheds in the larger Tibbee Creek \nWatershed and in the Tombigbee River Basin, the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed \nranked in the group with those most in need of restoration (those with a high \npotential stressors score). Red Bud – Catalpa is among those in the “low” group when \nthe human welfare value is considered, meaning there is limited threat to human \nhealth. The watershed falls within the medium group as far as environmental resource \nvalue is concerned, meaning that there are not significant natural resource features \n(e.g., threatened/endangered species, wildlife protection areas, etc.) contained within \nthe watershed.   \nTMDLs Studies show that the segment of Catalpa Creek which runs through Red Bud—\nCatalpa Creek Watershed has more sediment than the “pollution budget” allows—\nthere is too much sediment in the creek for a healthy, balanced community of aquatic \nspecies. This impairment has led to TMDL development which addresses at length the \nsediment issues of Catalpa Creek and gives a load reduction amount to return \nsediment to an acceptable level.  \nMonitoring studies also showed that two other pollutants – nutrients and pathogens – \nwere present in the larger HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) watersheds that Red Bud—\nCatalpa Creek Watershed is a part of.  TMDL studies have been completed for these. \nCurrent monitoring data, however, doesn’t address nutrients and pathogens levels in \nthe Red Bud--Catalpa Creek Watershed itself, although it is known that nutrients and \npathogens are present in some measure in its headwaters at the South Farm. Because \nof this, the restoration and protection plan will address them as well.  \nMississippi has developed an Uplands Nutrient Reduction Strategic Plan and is working \non developing numeric nutrient criteria as well. The South Farm will be an excellent \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   65 \n \nsite to showcase a variety of nutrient reduction practices. Effective implementation of \nthis water resources management plan should reduce the likelihood of a future \ndetermination of nutrient impairment for Catalpa Creek in the Red Bud—Catalpa \nCreek Watershed. \nFecal coliforms are indicator organisms, commonly found in human and animal feces. \nAlthough they are generally not harmful themselves, they indicate the possible \npresence of pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that also \nlive in human and animal digestive systems. Sources of fecal coliforms in the Catalpa \nCreek watershed include wildlife, livestock, and urban development. Nonpoint sources \nsuch as failing septic systems may also be a problem.  \nFor nutrients and sediments, there are presently no numeric criteria (numeric criteria \nare under development) and the applicable criteria are the narrative standard \nindicated in Mississippi’s water quality standards. Therefore, the target of the \nrestoration and protection will be to make the habitat and water quality acceptable \nfor aquatic life use support. \nWater Quality Restoration and Protection Goals and Targets.  The overarching goal \nof the restoration and protection efforts is to improve water quality through research, \ndevelopment, monitoring, modeling, and implementation activities. Specific water \nquality targets are given in Table 10.3.1 and load reduction goals to meet the targets \nin Table 10.3.2.  \nWhile not specifically developed for Catalpa Creek, the nutrient TMDL for the larger \nTib\n\nbee Creek Watershed called for reductions of total nitrogen (TN) loads of from 0% \nto 43% and reductions in total phosphorus of from 26% to 36%. For sediments, the \nunstable yields are larger than the target yields, therefore, a reduction is \nrecommended for HUC 03160104 (Tibbee Creek) of 77% to 97% (MDEQ, 2006). For \nFecal Coliforms (MDEQ, 2007a), the TMDL called for reductions of loads of 46% in \nwinter months and 92% in summer months. \nTable 10.3.1. Catalpa Creek Water Quality Targets for Restoration and Protection. \nPARAMETER WATER QUALITY TARGET  \nSediments Reduce sediment loads in order to remove aquatic life impairment as \nindicated by IBI  \nFecal Coliforms Reduce concentrations to or below specified seasonal criteria for fecal \ncoliforms \nNutrients Consider impact of numeric water quality standards for nutrients (coming \nsoon) using draft standards \n \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   66 \n \nTable 10.3.2. Reduction Goals as Established by TMDLs (MDEQ, 2006, MDEQ, 2007b, MDEQ, 2007a). \nPARAMETER LOAD REDUCTION \nSediments Assess and meet TMDL estimated reductions of sediment loadings (77-\n97%) \nFecal Coliforms Assess and meet TMDL estimated reductions of fecal coliform loadings \n(46-92%) \nNutrients Identify specific TMDL targets for the Catalpa Creek to remove \nimpairments and to meet draft (and then final) numeric criteria \n \nUncertainty exists whether these estimated TMDL load reductions are actually \nachievable in a natural system. This project is designed to reduce sediment loads as \nefficiently and cost-effectively as possible using available resources while promoting \ncompatibility with sustainable agricultural production and urban development. \nDocumenting the reductions gained and the costs expended will be helpful to \nunderstand this relationship and the achievability of the TMDL load reduction target. \n10.4 INTEGRATION OF WATER QUALITY TARGETS, GOALS, RESTORATION AND PROTECTION \nACTIVITIES, AND MODELING AND MONITORING  \n \nTo achieve and document success for the Catalpa Creek Watershed project, it is \nessential to integrate water quality targets, goals, restoration and protection \nactivities, and modeling and monitoring. The interrelationships of these components \nare identified below. \n Reduce Coliform Bacteria entering Catalpa Creek. \n– Identify and target sources of contamination;  \n– Identify interim targets and milestones in comparison to the water \nquality target;  \n– Identify and implement applicable BMPs to reduce loadings, such as \nimproving riparian vegetation and limiting livestock access, as described \nelsewhere in this report; and  \n– Implement tracking and monitoring plans to aid in evaluation and design \nof BMPs. \n Reduce erosion and sedimentation to improve water quality and meet aquatic \nlife criteria. \n– Identify and target sources of sediment loads (e.g. overland vs. stream \nbank erosion);  \n– Identify interim targets and milestones in comparison to the aquatic life \ncriteria quality target; \n– Identify BMPs to reduce sediment loadings, such as improving riparian \nvegetation and limiting livestock access, streambank rehabilitation and \nprotection, etc.;  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   67 \n \n– Using monitoring, modeling, and site characteristics, identify and \nprioritize BMP placement and density in a staged approach to meet water \nquality targets; \n– Restore areas that have experienced siltation; and \n– Implement tracking and monitoring plans to support assessments and \ncompliance determinations. \n Reduce nutrients entering Catalpa Creek. \n– Identify and target sources of nutrient loads (e.g. overland vs. internal \nloads (e.g. bottom sediments, stream bank erosion);  \n– Identify interim targets and milestones in comparison to the aquatic life \ncriteria target;  \n– Identify applicable BMPs to reduce nutrient loadings, such as improving \nriparian vegetation, improving turfgrass, etc.;  \n– Using monitoring, modeling, and site characteristics, identify and \nprioritize BMP placement and density in a staged approach to meet water \nquality targets; and \n– Implement tracking and monitoring plans to support assessments and \ncompliance determinations. \n Restore aquatic habitat as measured by the IBI targets: \n– Through research and monitoring, determining the causes driving the \npoor aquatic habitat (e.g. upland sediment erosion and delivery, \nstreambank erosion, and near-stream land disturbance, etc.);  \n– By identifying and implement, using a staged approach, BMPs and \nrestoration efforts targeted toward improving aquatic life support; and \n– By tracking trends toward achieving aquatic life support targets, such as \nfor nutrients and sediments. \n Design and demonstrate the use of models and other methods in order to aid \nand optimize the identification and strategic placement of appropriate BMPs and \nestimate cumulative impacts relative to the restoration and protection targets \n Design BMP and BMP monitoring efforts to both track their efficacy over time in \nachieving targeted flows and load reductions, determine the cumulative impact \nor costs (including construction and maintenance), and aid in the design of \nBMPs. \n Develop BMPs (structural and non-structural) to function as sites for research, \ndemonstration and education.  \n \n10.5 HABITAT \n \nHabitat Targets.  The targets for habitat include the specific additional targets of \nhabitat indicative of ecosystem health, ecosystem services, quality of life, and water \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   68 \n \nresources of the Catalpa Creek watershed. Specific targets will vary depending on the \nhabitat type within the watershed, including aquatic habitat, the habitat associated \nwith the south farm and associated agricultural uses, and the urban areas of the \nwatershed.  \nAquatic Habitat.  Aquatic habitat targets will be based in part on IBI as used by the \nMDEQ to determine stream impairment (non-attainment of water quality standards).  \nIn addition, aquatic habitat targets may include species of fish, crustaceans, \namphibians listed in \"Mississippi Species of Greatest Conservation Need\" and known \nor expected to occur within the Catalpa Creek Watershed. Other target organisms \nand/or indicators of the health of aquatic systems (e.g., other species, \nbioassessments, diversity indices), may also be considered as targets for restoration \nand used to track and assess the success of those efforts. \nAg Lands Habitat.  A large portion of the watershed is used for agriculture, including \nthe 1,600 acre MSU South Farm used for cattle, equine and poultry management \nresearch as well as the NRCS Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative demonstration site.  \nTargets for these areas will include BMPs to reduce stream loadings of fecal coliforms, \ncontrol of erosion and sedimentation, and nutrient runoff.  Additional targets will \ninclude specific species of birds, insects (e.g., pollinator species), and plant species \nindicative of ecosystem health. \nUrban Habitat.  Similarly, for urban portions of the watershed, specific targets are to \nreduce pollutant loadings while increasing habitat for desirable species indicative of \necosystem health.  \n10.6 INTEGRATION OF HABITAT QUALITY/ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION TARGETS, GOALS, RESTORATION \nAND PROTECTION ACTIVITIES, AND MONITORING \n \nAquatic Habitat/Ecosystem Function.  Restoration and protection of the aquatic \nhabitat and ecosystem function in the Catalpa Creek Watershed has as its goal, in \npart, meeting the IBI criteria as discussed in the section on water quality.  As Catalpa \nCreek is the major drainage systems for a large portion of the MSU campus and \nsurrounding areas it receives very high flows during storm events.  Backflow and \nflooding is also common in tributaries. The upper channel is deeply incised with steep \nbanks, which also show signs of high erosion during storm events, with increases in \nwidth and decreased slopes in downstream areas.  Other than storm water flows, the \nupper portion of the creek does receive some point source inflows, such as from the \nPoultry Science Research Center. However, maintaining aquatic habitat during low \nflow conditions is critical.  Goals for the restoration and protection of the creek may \ninclude: \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   69 \n \n Restore, to the extent possible, the natural structure of the creek and major \ntributaries \n Monitoring of biota and/or flow to assess progress \n Protection/reintroduction of native species \n Identification and maintenance of environmental flow requirements \n Creation of pools \n Reinstating/maintaining hydraulic connections \n Channel reshaping and stabilization \n Livestock exclusions and creation of passages \n \nAgricultural Lands Habitat.  A considerable portion of the watershed is utilized for \nagricultural production and research.  Habitat goals for these areas include: \n Reduction of pollutant loads (coliform bacteria, sediments, nutrients) \n– Identify and target sources of bacterial, nutrient and sediment loads \n– Identify structural and/or nonstructural best management practices \nto reduce loads, such as  \n Education; \n Conservation buffers; \n Livestock exclusions; \n Turf management; \n Erosion prevention; and \n Waste management and treatment. \n– Using monitoring, modeling, and site characteristics, identify and \nprioritize BMP placement and density in a staged approach to meet \nwater quality targets. \n– Implement tracking and monitoring plans to support assessments \nand compliance determinations. \n Improved Habitat \n– Identify potential targets for habitat construction or restoration for \ntarget (indicator) species, such as water, feeding, nesting habitat, \netc. consistent to the extent possible with nutrient practices for \nnutrient load reduction (e.g., conservation areas). \n– Using monitoring, modeling, and site characteristics, identify and \nprioritize habitat placement and density in a staged approach \n– Implement tracking and monitoring plans (e.g. banding, etc.) to \nsupport assessments and success of habitat creation/restoration for \ntarget species. \n \nUrban Habitat.  Urban habitat goals are similar to those for agricultural lands, \nalthough specific target species and best management practices may differ.  The \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   70 \n \noverall goal is reduction of nutrient loads and habitat improvement.  Specific goals \ninclude: \n Reducing impervious surface and encouraging policies and practices aimed at \nminimizing the creation of new impervious surfaces. \n Reduced storm water runoff and improve drainage to decrease risk of \nflooding. \n Implementing designs and practices that increase on-site infiltration. \n10.7 SOCIAL INDICATORS \n \nEffective management of nonpoint source (NPS) water pollution requires addressing \nnot only environmental conditions but the choices people make that impact the \nenvironment. A measure of those choices are social indicators that provide \ninformation about stakeholder awareness, attitudes, constraints, capacity, and \nbehaviors that are expected to lead to water quality improvement and protection \n(Genskow & Prokopy, 2011).  \nWater quality problems that have accumulated over time often take a like amount of \ntime to correct. The social dimension plays a key role in this scenario. Every individual, \ncommunity and culture has a set of beliefs and attitudes that guide decision-making \nand influence behavior.  Because watershed-scale restoration and protection success \ndepends upon a large percentage of watershed stakeholders understanding both the \nwater quality impacts of their land use activities and the importance of conservation, \nan important measure of progress should include confirming that awareness and \nattitudes are changing and behaviors are being adopted that serve to mitigate the \nproblem. Social indicators provide consistent measures of social change and can be \nused by planners and managers at all scales to estimate the impacts of their efforts \nand resources even while a lag exists for monitored improvements in water and \nhabitat quality.    \n \nSocial Indicator Targets.  Social indicator targeting involves first identifying audiences \nthat may impact or be impacted by the watershed restoration and protection plan, \nand then developing metrics that may be used to estimate pre- and post- levels of \nawareness, attitude, constraints, and behaviors. Once these audiences are selected, \nstakeholder surveys will be conducted that will identify social metrics that may be \nmeasured and tracked over time to evaluate restoration and protection success from \nthe social dimension. \nSocial Indicator Goals.  Specific social indicator goals have not yet been identified. \nAfter implementation of a watershed-scale survey to better understand the levels of \nawareness, attitudes, constraints, and behaviors, social indicator goals will be \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   71 \n \ndeveloped. However, goals could include (adapted from Genskow and Prokopy \n(2011)): \n Increased Awareness Among the Target Audience \n– Intended Outcome: Awareness gained regarding the relevant \ntechnical issues and/or recommended practices of the target \naudience in the critical area. \n Indicator 1: Awareness of pollutants impairing waterways. \n Indicator 2: Awareness of consequences of pollutants to water \nquality. \n Indicator 3: Awareness of appropriate practices to improve \nwater quality. \n Development of Awareness in the Target Audience Supportive of the \nCatalpa Creek watershed Restoration and Protection. \n– Intended Outcome: Attitudes changed in a way that is expected to \nfacilitate desired behavior change of target audiences in critical \nareas. \n Indicator 1: General water quality-related attitudes. \n Indicator 2: Willingness to take action to improve water \nquality. \n Reduction of Constraints for Using Appropriate Practices. \n– Intended Outcome: Constraints to behavior change will be reduced. \n Indicator 1: Constraints to behavior change. \n Increased Capacity to Address Restoration and Protection issues in the \nProject Area. \n– Intended Outcome 1: The project improved the recipient’s capacity \nto leverage resources in the watershed. \n Indicator 1: Resources leveraged by grant recipient in the \nwatershed as a result of project funding (including cash and in-\nkind resources). \n– Intended Outcome 2: Increased capacity to support appropriate \npractices by target audiences in critical areas. \n– Intended Outcome 3: Development of funding to support NPS \npractices in critical areas. \n Indicator 2: Technical support available for restoration and \nprotection practices in critical areas. \n Indicator 3: Ability to monitor practices in critical areas. \n Increased Adoption of Restoration and Protection Measures By Target \nAudience. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   72 \n \n– Intended Outcome: This project resulted in changes in behavior \nand/or adoption of practices to prevent new problems and improve \nor maintain water quality in the critical area by the target audience.  \n11 PROPOSED RESTORATION AND PROTECTION ACTIVITIES, AND COSTS \nIn the preceding section, restoration and protection targets and goals were presented. Also \nin that section, integration of the water quality and habitat quality/ecosystem function \ntargets, goals, restoration and protection activities, and modeling and monitoring were \ndiscussed. Section 11 will identify specific implementation practices and approaches needed \nto achieve the goals stated in Section 10. Additionally, the costs of implementing these \npractices are identified in this section.   \n11.1 SURFACE WATER QUALITY AND HABITAT RESTORATION AND PROTECTION ON AGRICULTURAL \nLANDS \n \nThe USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has established a widely-\naccepted suite of best management practices that are commonly used today by many \norganizations for restoration of water quality and habitat. These practices are \norganized by the resource concern(s) that is/are demonstrated in a watershed.   \nResource Concerns and Associated Practices.  Four resource concerns in the Catalpa \nCreek Watershed have been identified by experienced water quality and conservation \nprofessionals from state and federal agencies, the local Soil & Water Conservation \nDistrict, and MSU researchers. These resource concerns will be addressed by the \nsurface water quality and habitat restoration and protection practices identified in \nthis section. These resource concerns are listed below.   \n Water quality – sedimentation;  \n Grazing lands;  \n Sustainable forestry; and  \n Declining wildlife habitats. \nWater Quality – Sedimentation.  This concern addresses land where the current soil \nerosion rate is excessive (exceeds the soil loss tolerance rate) and critically eroding \nareas. Within the Catalpa Creek Watershed excessive soil erosion, classified as sheet \nand rill erosion, is common on sloping land and pronounced ephemeral and gully \nerosion is evident. Runoff containing sediment has led to Catalpa Creek’s listing as \nimpaired for sediment and the development of a sediment TMDL.  \nGrazing Lands.  Protection of soil health, reduction of runoff, prevention of the \ntransport of excess nutrients and animal waste, and maintaining or improving the \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   73 \n \nproductivity of adaptable forages to ensure sustainability agriculture are needed in \nthis watershed.  \nSustainable Forestry.  Emphasis on protecting state waters through implementing \neffective forestry conservation practices and establishing trees to promote a \nsustainable forestry resource is needed in this watershed.  \nDeclining Wildlife Habitats.  Habitats identified in this watershed that are declining \ninclude transition zones in cropland, pastureland and hayland fields; corridor habitat; \ndeclining native habitats; and infestations of\n\n invasive plants within wildlife habitats \nthat have adverse impacts. Habitat protection for listed threatened and endangered \nspecies in the watershed will also be addressed.  \nRecommended NRCS Practices, Codes, and Associated Practices.  The following \npractices have been recommended by NRCS staff for potential implementation in the \nCatalpa Creek Watershed, dependent upon site-specific conditions. These include \nstructural and nonstructural practices.  \nResource Concern:  Water Quality – Sedimentation (Table 11.1.1) \n (340) Cover and Green Manure Crop – A crop of close growing legumes and/or small \ngrain/ryegrass grown primarily for seasonal protection and soil improvement. Cover \ncrops are usually grown for one year or less.  The purpose of this practice is to control \nerosion during periods when the major crops do not furnish adequate cover and to \nadd organic matter back to the soil to improve water infiltration, aeration and tilth. \nCover crops may also provide food and cover for selected wildlife species. \n (342) Critical Area Planting – Establishing permanent vegetation on sites that have, or \nare expected to have, high erosion rates, and on sites that have physical, chemical or \nbiological conditions that prevent the establishment of vegetation with normal \npractices.  The purpose of this practice is to stabilize the soil, reduce erosion and \ndamage from sediment and runoff to downstream areas, to improve water quality, to \nimprove wildlife habitat, and to improve visual resources.  \n (350) Sediment Basin – A basin constructed with an engineered outlet, formed by an \nembankment or excavation or a combination of the two.  The purpose of this practice \nis to capture and detain sediment laden runoff, or other debris for a sufficient length \nof time to allow it to settle out in the basin. Sediment basins are the last line of \ndefense for capturing sediment that cannot be addressed by common erosion control \nmeasures; therefore, all initial efforts should be on stopping the erosion at the source.  \nAssociated practice to this practice is (342). \n (362) Diversion – A channel constructed across the slope with a supporting ridge on \nthe lower side to divert runoff.  The purpose of this practice is to divert excess water \nfrom one area for use or safe disposal in other areas.  Associated practices are (342), \n(412) and (620). \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   74 \n \n (386) Field Border – A strip of permanent vegetation established at the edge or \naround the perimeter of a field.  The purpose of this practice is to establish food, \ncover (including nesting and brood cover) for wildlife, including pollinator \nhabitat/corridors.   \n (393) Filter Strip – A strip or area of herbaceous vegetation that removes \ncontaminants from overland flow.  The purpose of this practice may be applied as \npart of a conservation management system to accomplish one or more of the \nfollowing purposes: to reduce suspended solids and associated contaminants in \nrunoff, dissolve contaminant loadings in runoff, and to suspend solids and associated \ncontaminants in irrigation tail water.  \n (410) Grade Stabilization Structure – A structure used to control the grade and head \ncutting in natural or artificial channels.  The purpose of this practice is to stabilize the \ngrade and control erosion in natural or artificial channels, to prevent the formation or \nadvance of gullies, and to enhance environmental quality and reduce pollution \nhazards.  Associated practices (460) and (342). \n (412) Grassed Waterway – A shaped or graded channel that is established with \nsuitable vegetation to carry surface water at a non-erosive velocity to a stable outlet.  \nThe purpose of this practice is to convey runoff from terraces, diversions, or other \nwater concentrations without causing erosion or flooding; to reduce gully erosion; \nand to protect/improve water quality.  Associated practices (342) and (620). \n (460) Land Clearing – Removing trees, stumps, and other vegetation from wooded \nareas to achieve a conservation objective.  The purpose of the practice is to facilitate \nneeded land use adjustments and improvements to an existing site in the interest of \nnatural resource conservation.  This practice applies to wooded areas where the \nremoval of trees, stumps, brush, and other vegetation is needed in order to \nimplement a conservation objective.  Associated practices, like plantings, other \nstructures, or irrigation/drainage water management practices, would be contracted \nseparately as needed. \n (580) Streambank and Shoreline Protection – Treatment(s) used to stabilize and \nprotect banks of streams or constructed channels, and shorelines of lakes, reservoirs, \nor estuaries.  The purpose of this practice is to prevent the loss of land or damage to \nland uses, or other facilities adjacent to the banks of streams or constructed channels, \nshoreline of lakes, reservoirs, or estuaries including the protection of known \nhistorical, archeological, and traditional cultural properties; To maintain the flow \ncapacity of streams or channels; To reduce the offsite or downstream effects of \nsediment resulting from bank erosion; and To improve or enhance the stream \ncorridor for fish and wildlife habitat, aesthetics, recreation.  Associated practice is \n(342). \n (600) Terrace – An earth embankment, or a combination ridge and channel \nconstructed across the field slope.  The purpose of the practice is to reduce slope \nlength, erosion, sediment content in runoff water, improve water quality, retain \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   75 \n \nrunoff for moisture conservation, prevent gully development, reform the land surface, \nimprove farmability and flooding.  Associated practices are (342) and (620). \n (620) Underground Outlet – A conduit installed beneath the surface of the ground to \ncollect surface water and convey it to a suitable outlet.  The purpose of the practice is \nto dispose of excess water from terraces, diversions, subsurface drains, surface \ndrains, trickle tubes or principle spillways from dams (outside the dam area only), or \nother concentrations without causing damage by erosion or flooding.  Associated \npractices are (342), (412), and (600).  \nResource Concern:  Grazing Lands (Table 11.1.2) \n (315) Herbaceous Weed Control – Removal or control of herbaceous weeds \nincluding invasive, noxious, and prohibited plants.  Herbaceous weed control and \nmanagement to enhance or maintain native or desired plant species on \npastureland.  Associated Practices listed in this resource concern:  (528).   \n (342) Critical Area Planting – Establishing permanent vegetation on sites that \nhave, or are expected to have, high erosion rates, and on sites that have physical, \nchemical, or biological conditions that prevent the establishment of vegetation \nwith normal practices.  To stabilize the soil, reduce erosion and damage from \nsedimentation and runoff to downstream areas, to improve water quality, to \nimprove wildlife habitat, and to improve visual resources.  \n (362) Diversion – A channel constructed across the slope with a supporting ridge \non the lower side to divert runoff.  To divert excess water from one area for use \nor safe disposal in other areas.  Associated practices list in this resource concern:  \n(342). \n (378) Pond – A water impoundment made by constructing a dam or an \nembankment or by excavating a pit or dugout.  To provide needed water for \nlivestock in a planned grazing system.  Associated practices in this resource \nconcern:  (342), (382), (516), & (614). \n (382) Fence – Dividing or enclosing an area of land with a suitable structure that \nacts as a barrier to livestock.  To subdivide grazing lands to create additional \ngrazing cell that will allow the implementation of a prescribed grazing system.  \n(NRCS has a practice payment cap of $7,500 - $9,000 per contract).   \n (410) Grade Stabilization Structure – A structure used to control the grade and \nhead cutting in natural or artificial channels.

The framework is based on hierarchical relationships between hydrology \n(Level 1), hydraulics (Level 2), geomorphology (Level 3), physicochemistry (Level 4), and \nbiology (Level 5) in a conceptual pyramid with hydrology at the base moving upward to \nbiology.  \nThe application of this framework will entail the evaluation of the hydrological and \nhydraulic changes that have occurred in the past and contribute to their current \ncondition, as well as geomorphological and biological attributes in the present. The \nevaluation will apply knowledge from existing stable reference reaches in the headwater \ntributaries and upper reaches of Catalpa Creek (where available); the integrated modeling \nof existing watershed hydrology, stream hydraulics and sediment transport, and channel \nmorphology conditions; and the modeling of changes associated with proposed typical \nstream restoration design scenarios. \nTypical design scenarios would address hydrodynamic processes, sediment transport \nprocesses, stream stability and riparian buffer restoration, which according to Fischenich \n(2006), are the most fundamental stream functions and processes that create and \nmaintain the diverse biological communities, chemical and nutrient processes, diverse \nhabitats, and water and soil quality improvement in a stream, being the more dependent \nfunctions that typically require time to be established in a fluvial system.  \nBased on the physical and economic constraints identified from the entailed evaluation, \nthe restoration design scenarios of existing incised streams would search for establishing \na connection between the bankfull stage of the channels and its floodplain, or stabilizing \ndegraded streams, while addressing the underlying processes that create and maintain \nstream biological functions. In other words, the priority levels for the restoration of \nincised streams developed by Rosgen (1997) is the chosen approach to replace the incised \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   86 \n \nchannel with a new, stable stream at a higher elevation (Priority 1), or to widen or create \na new stable stream and floodplain at the existing channel bed elevation (Priorities 2, and \n3). Channel stabilization techniques using in-stream structures and bioengineering to \ndecrease streambed and streambank erosion (Priority 4) would be used only along highly \nconstrained environments.   \nA monitoring and management plan will be prepared and implemented to evaluate not \nonly the criteria used, but how well the criteria met the objectives; direct any necessary \nmodifications or improvements for future work; and validate the models used for \nassessment leading to the design to ensure that predictions are correct in relation to \nobservations. \nImplementation monitoring would determine if the design variables, structures and \nriparian plantings were constructed or established correctly. The natural variability of \nstream-type morphological data should be used to help evaluate if the channel \ndimension, pattern and profile were implemented within a range that matches the \nnatural variability of the reference reach data. \nEffectiveness monitoring would evaluate if the intended objectives of the restoration \nwere met. It will also determine if post-runoff channel adjustments following restoration \nfall within the range of natural variability for dimension, pattern and profile data. \nValidation monitoring would evaluate if the predictions match the post-restoration \nresponse. This monitoring is directed at the response of post runoff, such as streambank \nerosion reduction and bed stability vs. the predicted response generated from hydrology, \nhydraulic, sediment transport and channel evolution modeling. \nPhysical monitoring would involve cross-sections and longitudinal profiles resurveys to \ncheck post-restoration construction (implementation) vs. post-runoff response \n(effectiveness). The biological monitoring should include pre- and post-restoration \npopulation estimates and macro-invertebrate inventories. Vegetative mortality and \nsurvival plots will establish post-restoration success response. \nA management plan for the Catalpa Creek Watershed will be developed to ensure that \nthe implemented design is successful. The plan would include replanting or seeding \nreestablished riparian vegetation; post-runoff inspections of structures for grade control, \nstreambank stabilization, cross roads, or fish habitat enhancement; post-runoff \ninspections for the dimension, pattern, and profile of the design to verify restored \nreaches stay within the natural variability of stable reference channels within each typical \ndesign scenario. \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   87 \n \n11.3 SURFACE WATER QUALITY AND HABITAT RESTORATION AND PROTECTION IN THE URBAN \nENVIRONMENT   \n \nRestoration and protection activities in the urbanized area of the Catalpa Creek \nWatershed will focus largely on MSU’s campus. Fortuitously, MSU’s Master Plan \ncomprehensively addresses this issue.  \n \nMSU Master Plan.  In 2010, MSU released its Master Plan that provides a vision for the \nfuture and serves as a living document that establishes a framework that conceptualizes a \nlong-term strategic view for future campus development (MSU, 2010). The Master Plan \npromotes sustainable and responsible development with the aim of enriching the natural \nenvironment, local community and campus life. It concentrates academic, research and \nsupport facilities in the central campus area, limits impacts on surrounding farm land and \nwooded areas, aims to utilize existing infrastructure efficiently and promotes a collegiate, \npedestrian—scale environment.  \nThe sustainable design strategies of the Master Plan address the relationship between \nthe quality of life, the local climate and resource consumption patterns, and addresses \nenvironmental sustainability in four key areas – land use, water resources, climate \nresponse (energy and atmosphere), and mobility. Because of the location of a portion of \nMSU’s campus in the headwaters of the Catalpa Creek Watershed, the need and \nopportunity exists to integrate urban land use planning contained in MSU’s Master Plan \nwith watershed-scale planning for the 28,939 acre watershed.  \nThe following portions of the Mississippi State University 2010 Master Plan were \noriginally produced by consultant LPK Architects, P.A. and provided by the MSU Master \nPlan Development Advisory Committee (MSU, 2010). Parts of the following information \nare excerpted and/or paraphrased from various sections of MSU’s Master Plan.  \nMaster Plan Principles.  MSU’s Master Plan embraces the concept of sustainability and is \ninformed by a comprehensive range of social, environmental and economic principles. \nThe environmental principles are identified below. \n \nNatural Environment \nClimate – sustainable building and landscape design requires an understanding of the \nlocal climate conditions and the impact these conditions have on human comfort, energy \nuse, and rainwater management. In response, the Master Plan provides specific guidance \nfor building orientation and the use of landscape to address shading and rainwater (storm \nwater) management objectives. \nHabitat – as a land grant institution, the way in which MSU protects the land resources, \nforests and the habitats of the campus is a reflection of the sustainability values of the \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   88 \n \ninstitution. The Master Plan provides policies, planning and design guidance to ensure \nthat sustainable land management practices are incorporated. \nHydrology – with the focus on sustainability, storm water management concepts are \nincorporated in the landscape and infrastructure design recommendations for the \ncampus and the surrounding context. Storm water is noted to be a community-wide \nconcern given the way in which off campus development affects the hydrological \nconditions on the campus and vice versa. The Master Plan recommends a comprehensive \nstorm water management strategy for the campus utilizing low-impact design techniques \ncombining engineering with landscape elements. The intended outcome is a storm water \nstrategy featuring ponds, bioswales, and rain gardens that manage water above ground in \nassociation with landscape solutions that improve the aesthetic qualities of the campus \nenvironment. \nBuilt Environment \nLand use – MSU’s legacy as a land grant University is evident in the 4,400 acre main \ncampus and extensive land holdings across the state. To ensure that land resources are \nprovided to support the existing and future mission of MSU, the Master Plan includes \npolicies and planning guidance to protect and preserve land for mission-related purposes. \nLandscape – sustainable landscape practices are proposed in the Master Plan to assist the \nUniversity in developing a “working landscape”.  A working landscape strategically \npositions trees and other landscape elements to provide shade, mitigate the heat island \neffect and contribute to a comprehensive storm water management strategy. A working \nlandscape contributes to energy efficiency goals by shading buildings and horizontal \nsurfaces, thereby, reducing the air conditioning loads on buildings. The landscape can also \nbe viewed as a location for geothermal energy. \nSpace – providing appropriate and adequate space to support the academic, research and \noutreach mission of MSU is a key goal of the Master Plan. The space needs \nrecommendations are based on an understanding of the building conditions assessments \nand the space needs analysis. Building renovation and demolition recommendations are \nprovided al\n\nong with potential new development to meet projected space needs. Detailed \ninformation for the building conditions and space needs is provided in the technical \nappendix. The Master Plan provides a flexible approach for accommodating the current \nand future academic and research space requirements of MSU. Based on the projected \nneeds for a headcount of 22,000 students, additional space is required for offices, study \nand library functions, assembly and exhibition, dining, student union and lounge and \nrecreation (details are provided in the space needs report of the technical appendix). \nInterdisciplinary research is noted to be an emerging focus area requiring new facilities to \nencourage collaboration among faculty members. The Master Plan, through a \ncombination of renovation and new construction, illustrates adequate capacity to \naccommodate the emerging academic and research needs of MSU. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   89 \n \nInfrastructure – the efficiency of the campus generation and distribution systems is a key \nconsideration for the sustainable future MSU is targeting. The Master Plan concentrates \nfuture development in the academic core in order to better utilize existing infrastructure \nand to facilitate an efficient expansion of the systems. Detailed recommendations for \ninfrastructure improvements are provided in the technical appendix. \nMobility – MSU’s recent focus on the pedestrianization of the campus combined with an \nemphasis on bicycle use supports MSU’s sustainability objectives, notably the desired \nincrease in sustainable transportation options and the associated reduction in \ntransportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. The recommendations of the Master \nPlan provide a comprehensive, integrated approach to transportation embracing the \nconcept of mobility; recommendations that provide a number of transportation options \nto serve the campus community with the goal of decreasing single occupancy vehicle use \non the campus and reducing the associated impacts including congestion and emissions.  \nTo that end, improvements to infrastructure, land use coordination and \nscheduling/operational strategies are proposed in the Master Plan. \nResource Flows \nPotable water – the University consumes an average of one million gallons of water per \nday. In line with the sustainability objectives of MSU, strategies are required to reduce \nconsumption and patterns of use. The Master Plan supports this objective, in part, by \nproposing the use of indigenous plant materials (plants that require less irrigation) and \nother infrastructure improvements. Details for the potable water infrastructure and \nstrategies for reduction consumption are provided in the technical appendix.  \nEnergy – MSU has made good progress toward its sustainability goals by reducing energy \nconsumption by 20+ percent since 2006 (the base line year). This progress is of particular \nimportance given the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning’s mandate to reduce \nenergy consumption by 30 percent and MSU’s decision to sign the American College and \nUniversity President’s Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) and the ultimate goal of working \ntoward climate neutrality. The Master Plan incorporates planning and landscape \nstrategies to reduce energy consumption on both existing and proposed buildings. A \nshade strategy, based on the strategic placement of shade trees, is incorporated in the \nplan to reduce the cooling load on buildings and diminish the size and impact of heat \nislands adjacent to buildings. Future buildings are oriented on the east-west axis to \nminimize excessive heat gain in the warmer months and to enhance the passive solar \nqualities during the winter months. Details for reducing energy consumption of the \ncampus buildings and infrastructure are provided in the technical appendix. \nEmissions – as a signatory of the ACUPCC, MSU has committed to the goal of climate \nneutrality. The ACUPCC not only signals the beginning of a focused effort to reduce \ncarbon emissions, but also a commitment to sustainability in the broadest sense – a \ncommitment not only to transform the MSU campus, but to continue with the \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   90 \n \ntransformation of the mission, curriculum, research and operations of the University. This \ncommitment is in synch with the original land grant values of stewardship, education, \nresearch and outreach. Achieving climate neutrality will necessitate significant changes to \nUniversity operations and is detailed in MSU’s Climate Action Plan. \nMaterials/wastes – in support of this goal, MSU will need to complete an analysis of the \nwaste streams and volumes associated with campus activities, expand the recycling \nprograms and continue to enhance and potentially expand the composting program.  \nMaster Plan Frameworks.  The Master Plan consists of physical design, programmatic and \nfunctional frameworks which collectively form a comprehensive and coordinated vision \nfor guiding incremental change. Several key components of these frameworks related to \nthe Catalpa Creek Watershed Restoration & Protection Project is the Master Plan’s Land \nUse and Landscape Frameworks.  \nLand Use Framework   \nMSU’s legacy as a land grant University is evident in the extensive land holdings of the \n4,400 acre main campus. The South and North Farms serve as open laboratories for a \nnumber of programs in agriculture, forestry, veterinary medicine and MAFES. The Master \nPlan promotes the stewardship of this land to meet the need of current programs as well \nas future generations, a key objective of sustainability. In response, policies are provided \nto protect campus farm land the encroachment of from continued sprawl.  \nThe H.H. Leveck Animal Research Center (South Farm) is defined by the low lying areas of \ncampus and the associated floodplain conditions of Catalpa Creek. A 100-foot wide buffer \ncentered on the alignment of the creek is provided to ensure protection of water quality \nand to control erosion. To protect the South Farm lands, development is prohibited \nunless it is directly relation to academic or research activity. Development along the \nproposed south entry road is also prohibited for any purpose other than agricultural or \nforestry facilities. \nThe R.R. Foil Plant Science Research Center (North Farm) encompasses some of the best \nfarmland in Oktibbeha County, a factor that can be attributed to the extensive floodplain \nassociated with Sand Creek. To protect this land, no development is permitted on North \nFarm in the floodplain areas. Development outside the floodplain is limited to uses that \nare directly related to and support agricultural activities. \nExpansion for the Research Park is reserved to the east of the current development. A \nnew access roadway is proposed to connect Research Boulevard with the expansion site.  \nThe framework for core campus land use focuses on five components – topography, \nhydrology, land use patterns, circulation patterns, and development sites (Figure 11.3.1). \nThe influence of the topography on the campus development is apparent in the \nplacement of buildings. A majority of the buildings are sited on the higher ground or \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   91 \n \n“plateau” of the campus; the land above elevation 360’. The edges of the plateau, in \nseveral areas, are characterized by steep slopes which complicate pedestrian circulation \nand building placement. The most valuable land for the academic mission is defined by \nthe 10 minute walking radius surrounding the drill field. Because of this, the land within \nthe 10 minute walking radius is prioritized for academic and key campus life facilities. \nRegarding hydrology, the stream corridors and drainage patterns are evident in the land \nuse pattern of the campus. Catalpa Creek and its eastern and western branches define \nthe low lying areas along Stone Boulevard and Hardy Road. The open spaces, landscapes \nand woods associated with these areas are reinforced in the Master Plan as defining \nfeatures of the campus. On the north side of campus, the low lying area extending from \nBarr Avenue to Coliseum Drive, and ultimately to Chadwick Lake, is reimaged as a \nlandscape and water management corridor providing strong links between the academic \ncore of the campus and the athletics district.  \nLand use patterns reflect the iconic landscapes and open spaces that contribute to a \nmemorable campus character. Building upon the organizational structure established by \nthese spaces, new landscape linkages are proposed in the Master Plan to provide better \nconnectivity and to extend the positive qualities of the landscape to other areas of the \ncampus. \nThe circulation patterns of the campus are improved and extended to provide a \ncomprehensive network of pedestrian, bicycle, transit and vehicular circulation routes \nacross the campus.  \nWithin the framework of topography, hydrology, land use and circulation   patterns of the \ncampus, several development sites are identified. In some cases, the proposed sites \ninclude the redevelopment of existing buildings while in other cases, the sites are readily \navailable for development.  \n \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   92 \n \nFigure 11.3.1. Land use framework with flood plain. \n  \nNorth Farm  \nResearch \nPark \nMain Campus \nSouth Farm \nEquestrian Park \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   93 \n \nLandscape Framework – Storm Water Management.  Storm water management is a key \ncomponent of the Landscape Framework contained in MSU’s Master Plan because of the \nflooding problems that exist along the east and west branches of Catalpa Creek, which \nare especially problematic on the South Farm.  \nA storm water impact analysis was performed during the planning process on the existing \ncampus conditions to inform the Master Plan and identify existing problem areas. The \nanalysis was based on site topography and surface cover. Land within the campus \nboundaries was broken into 12 different catchments, six of which drain into Catalpa Creek \n(Figure 11.3.2). The remaining five drain to various points along the north and east \nperimeter.  Soils on campus are hydraulic, with slow infiltration rates and high runoff \npotential. \nIn the developed campus core the percent of impervious surface ranges from 24 percent \nto 53 percent. The chief concern in the core campus is water quality control, peak run off \nvolume and total runoff volume. Since most of the area discharges directly to Catalpa \nCreek, addressing water quality is an important issue. The initial inch of rain and \nsubsequent storm water runoff is known to contain the majority of storm water \npollutants, thus, addressing the initial run off can greatly improve water quality.  \nThe sustainable storm water management strategies for the MSU campus address three \ninterrelated variables/metrics – water quality, water volume, and peak rate of flow.   \nWater quality—impervious pavement and development prevents natural percolation \nof storm water into the soils. Run-off from developed areas is contaminated by \nchemical pollution such as motor oil and salt resulting in water quality concerns. \nProposed water treatment strategies include “green” alternatives that mimic the \nfunctions of the natural landscape and allow for treatment in the form of green roofs \nand rain gardens integrated into the campus landscape. \nWater volume—on the MSU campus storm water is collected and flows to Catalpa \nCreek and other stream corridors \nPeak flow rate—is a concern due to the surcharging during high intensity, short \nduration rainfall events. The recommended strategies for mitigating the peak flow \nrate include detention and retention facilities incorporated with the landscape \nfeatures of a site. \nThe landscape strategy for storm water management and mitigation offers great \npotential to improve water quality and ecosystem function in the watershed. The use of \nlandscape as a means of reducing peak rate of storm water runoff, limiting the total \nvolume of runoff to pre-developed hydrologic conditions and providing water quality \ntreatment can also avoid the expense of subsurface infrastructure systems and deep \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   94 \n \n(fenced-off) detention basins. Landscape \nrecommendations associated with storm \nwater are identified below.  \n Provide a 100-foot \nstream buffer on all \ncampus streams;  \n Incorporate low \nimpact development (LID) \nlandscape solutions as vital \ncomponent of future campus  \nplanning and development;  \n Sub-watersheds should be studied \nin relation to future campus \nprojects that impact pervious \nsurfaces (i.e., existing lawn or \nplanted areas) so that landscape \nmitigation proposals (on-site or \noff-site) can be incorporated as \npart of the project;  \n Where feasible, on-site storm \nwater treatment should be \nprovided for all newly constructed \ncampus buildings and landscape \nprojects;  \n Protect and re-vegetate landscape areas along existing creeks and drainage ways \n(within the 100-foot buffer);  \n Direct storm water flow from existing creek beds to water receiving landscapes \nthat are designed to allow for infiltration and slow discharge (i.e., bio-retention \ncells); and  \n Enhance landscapes around existing on-site water resources (Chadwick Lake) \nwith vegetated filters and water absorbing plantings at storm water discharge \npoints to improve water quality.  \nRecommended best management practices for existing campus buildings and \ninfrastructure as well as new facilities are storm water retention basins and stream \nprotection buffers.  \nStorm Water Retention Basins.  The Master Plan minimizes the impact of future \nexpansion by concentrating development in the established core of the campus and by \nincorporating several retention basins to address water quality and rate of runoff. The \nretention basins, which are proposed as part of the landscape strategy for the campus, \n____ Catchment Boundary \n▬▬ Retention Pond Flood Plain \n▬▬ Potential Retention Basins \n▬▬ Stream Protection Buffers \nFigure 11.3.2. Campus flow patterns and catchments with \nproposed retention basins and stream buffers. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   95 \n \nare proposed along the central, eastern and western branches of Catalpa Creek to \nintercept runoff associated with campus development as well as runoff associated with \ndevelopment off campus. The following retention facilities are proposed: \nSouth Entry—a major new retention pond reminiscent of Chadwick lake is proposed on \nthe south end of campus in conjunction with the new south entry road improvements. \nThis new facility is envisioned as part of the gateway experience and is intended to \nintercept water flowing from the central and western branches of Catalpa Creek. The \npond is one of a series extending along the northwest branch of Catalpa Creek. \nStone Boulevard recreation fields—a retention pond is proposed at the south end of the \nrecreation fields to intercept water from the adjacent parking necessary to support south \ncampus development. \nHardy Road—two retention facilities are proposed along the eastern branch of Catalpa \nCreek to intercept water flowing south and west from Eckies Pond. A second pond, \ndirectly west of Hardy Road, is proposed to intercept runoff from development in the \nsouth campus district. \nStream Protection Buffers.  A 100-foot wide stream protection buffer is proposed along \nall major stream corridors throughout the campus. The buffers are envisioned to \nincorporate appropriate riparian planting to minimize erosion and control runoff. The \nproposed buffers are indicated in the water resources framework. \nThe proposed storm water recommendations focus on horizontal surfaces and the \nrainwater capturing potential of those surfaces. The goal is to leave the water as diffusely \nscattered across these surfaces as possible.  \nRecommended strategies for future facilities and sites include: \n Green Roofs.  MSU should consider installing green roofs on roof replacement \nprojects and on new buildings. Green roofs retain storm water and return a \nportion directly to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. Features include: \n– A layer of vegetation installed on flat or low sloped roofs; \n– “Extensive” green roofs feature a thin layer of soil and are usually \ncomposed of sedum; \n– “intensive” green roofs have a thicker soil layer and contain shrubs, trees \nand other vegetation; \n– green roofs can retain 15-90% of rainfall; \n– green roofs are most effective in reducing run-off volume and rate; and \n– green roofs can reduce air pollution, provide habitat for wildlife and \nsound insulation. \n Rain Gardens.  MSU should drain roofs into rain gardens wherever possible. Rain \ngardens are landscape features designed to retain and infiltrate storm water. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   96 \n \nThey are typically 6 to 18 inches deep and include plants tolerant to periodic \nsubmersion.  It is recommended that all future quadrangles and landscape areas \nbe designed as rain gardens or water receiving landscapes, conditions \npermitting. These rain gardens should feature:  \n Small, vegetated depressions used to capture and infiltrate storm water runoff; \n Plants with appropriate soil mixture and planted with native shrubs, grasses and \nflowering plants; and \n Detention times of no more than 24 hours. \n Pedestrian Hardscape.  MSU should consider pervious paving for pedestrian \nhardscapes. Permeable concrete, paving stone or crushed stone allowing water \nto drain directly into the ground.  In the clay soil conditions, such as those on the \nMSU campus, the excavation and creation of a drainage layer approximately 24 \ninches deep is required. Pervious paving is recommended where there is no \noption for creating a water receiving land\n\nscape. Other hardscape design \nstrategies should include:  \n Plan for a reduction in impervious area; and  \n Utilization of french drains and dry wells in appropriate locations (soil conditions \npermitting). \n Bio-retention Swales.  Bio-retention swales are recommended in all future \nsurface parking areas with adequate land area (suggested area: equivalent to 5% \nof the surface area drained) and suitable soil conditions. The bio- retention \nswales are landscapes where water is diverted and detained to treat and slow \ndown peak flow rates. Pervious paving should be considered but only where \nwater receiving landscapes are not possible. \nInfrastructure Framework.  The Master Plan also provides recommendations for \nestablishing a “green” approach to infrastructure. The plan provides comprehensive \nstorm water management concepts and recommendations with the intent of improving \nwater quality, decreasing runoff and preventing erosion and flooding. It also focuses on \nefficiency in the traditional infrastructure.   \nPlantings.  The vegetative elements of the landscape including trees, shrubs, ground \ncover and lawns are an essential and defining part of the MSU campus. Trees and shrubs \nhelp define campus open spaces, help define the quality of the campus environment and \nalso support the long-term goals of campus sustainability. Plantings can also facilitate the \nperformance of natural systems (i.e. waterways and drainage patterns) and improve \noverall campus storm water management and performance. Protecting existing \nvegetation, removing invasive plants, and supplementing with new plantings will ensure \nthat natural systems continue to function and improve over time. Appropriate selection \nand location of trees can provide shade and mitigate heat islands of pavement and west \nfacing building facades. In all cases, plantings should be implemented to emphasize these \nlarger formative landscape characteristics. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   97 \n \nIrrigation.  Currently MSU’s entire irrigation water supply comes from potable sources \n(campus wells). It is recommended that all MSU plantings be designed to thrive without \nirrigation after an initial growth establishment period. Recommendations relating to \nirrigation include: \n Limit irrigation to campus lawn areas that receive heavy pedestrian and \ntailgating use (i.e., the Junction); \n Consider non-potable water sources for the irrigation water supply (Chadwick \nlake and Eckies Pond); \n Limit irrigation operations to periods of time associated with heavy use (i.e. \ntailgating, recreation activities); \n Implement weather station(s) for monitoring and managing irrigation zones and \nprogramming irrigation time periods; \n Update mapping of all existing campus irrigation zones and plan for improved \nmaintenance planning and operations; \n Conduct periodic inspections of irrigation heads to repair and reduce over-spray \nonto non-irrigated surfaces; \n All newly implemented planted areas should be supplied with amended planting \nsoils designed with moisture retention capacity to reduce irrigation dependency; \n Provide a supplemental watering program (in-house maintenance operations or \nlandscape installation contract) associated with new plant growth establishment \nand limit to a two-year period; and \n Native and adaptive hardy plant selection criteria should consider watering \ndemands as part of the plant selection process. \nMSU Estimated Average Annual Cost for Urban Storm Water Protection.  MSU’s \naverage annual cost for urban storm water protection is not known at this time. \nHowever, efforts will be made to identify and quantify/estimate these costs. This will \ninclude costs for existing activities as well as for future construction and operations. \nIn addition to the above referenced items from the MSU Master Plan, the following \nrestoration and management activities are also proposed. \nBest Turfgrass Management Practices. Highly maintained turfgrass, such as that \nsurrounding Davis Wade Stadium, is frequently overseeded with perennial ryegrass in \nthe fall of the year, which increases nutrient demand. Overseeding yields a turf that is \ngreen year round, thus fertilized nearly twice as much as it would be if it were not \noverseeded (approximately 4 to 8 lb N / 1000 ft\n2\n). \nModerately maintained turf areas, like that surrounding campus buildings or adjacent to \nsidewalks, require approximately 3 to 5 lb N / 1000 ft\n2\n, but are infrequently irrigated. \nHowever, these areas are often proximal to impervious surfaces where runoff is more \napt to be channeled toward open sewers and storm water confluence features, \nultimately resulting in offsite movement of nutrients.  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   98 \n \nThe loss mechanisms of turf applied nutrients, especially nitrogen, are well understood. \nHowever, loss is highly variable due to abundant factors – nitrogen source, rainfall \nintensity, surface slope, turf health, erosion potential, soil water status during \napplication and immediately after, turf species and variety, light levels, soil and air \ntemperature, soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and soil type.  \nNitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is a term commonly used to indicate relative balance of \napplied nitrogen versus that used by turf. Reported NUE for warm-season grasses range \nfrom 63 to 84% (Bowman et al., 2002).  Nitrogen loss may be due to leaching, \nvolatilization, direct run-off, or immobilization.  \nLeaching - Precipitation and irrigation beyond evapotransporational demands of turf \nincreases NO\n3\n leaching from Kentucky bluegrass (Morton et al., 1988) and hybrid \nbermudagrass (Snyder et al., 1984). Implications are that Mississippi’s heavy rainfall and \nthe level of irrigation required to maintain turf aesthetics and wear tolerance may \ncontribute to excessive nutrient leaching. \nVolatilization – Soils harbor bacteria that thrive in saturated (anaerobic) conditions. \nThese microbes convert NO\n3\n nitrogen to oxygen and nitrogen gases. Volatilization of \nNH\n4\n occurs when urea nitrogen sources are applied in the presence of water and urease.  \nObjectives for turfgrass management. The following objectives, if implemented both on \nthe central campus and the surrounding research farms, could decrease nitrogen species \nloading into Catalpa Creek and sustain a healthy Catalpa Creek Watershed: \n1. reduce nutrient input;  \n2. reduce storm water runoff intensity; \n3. correct turf species selection (and in some instances reducing turf acreage \naltogether);  \n4. improve nutrient management; and  \n5. increase stakeholder awareness of the proper turfgrass best management \npractices.   \nMajor Considerations for turfgrass management.  The headwaters of Catalpa Creek \noriginate on the ridge line where Davis Wade Stadium is situated. Within this basin, \napproximately 25 acres of maintained turfgrass lawn flow directly onto an impervious \nsurface or into a storm-water sewer. This direct runoff may be considered a point source \nfor downstream pollution. The sports field itself, does not drain south but north, piped \ndirectly into Chadwick Lake.  \nTracing the creek further south, the water is day-lighted into a deeply downcut and \nchannelized creek which courses under black jack to reemerge and become the principle \nconfluence feature of the entirety of South Farm.  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   99 \n \nBeginning at faculty housing nearest the creek, there exists low maintenance lawn and \nintramural fields which are allowed to directly flow into the creek. The campus master \nplan depicts the remaining daylighted creek north of Blackjack being covered, which is \nsure to increase already evident flooding potential further north of the already \ndeteriorated natural flood plain. This too will increase downstream flooding and will \nfurther downcut the channel, possibly leading to road instability and infrastructure \nfailure at the Blackjack creek crossing and other crossings or paralleling roads \ndownstream.  \nFertility budgets for the University grounds exist but are not readily available at this \ntime; however, it could be surmised that turf cover on the MSU campus comprises a \nmoderate risk to stream and ecosystem health within the Catalpa Creek watershed. \nSpecifically, storm water runoff exceeds the creeks capacity without bolstered or \nreestablished flood mitigation. Ideally, these mitigation techniques would include \nreturning some, if not all, of the currently daylighted Catalpa Creek to a natural flood \nplain. Similarly, retention and water recharge areas should be mandated on newly \nconstructed parking lots, and remediation techniques, such as bio swells and \nraingardens, should be added to high impact areas of existing impervious areas, as well \nas maintained turf.  \nReducing impervious surfaces and mitigating storm water run-off should be a guiding \nprinciple for all future master planning of the University campus. Regular street \nsweeping and a comprehensive recycling and waste management program are needed \nto reduce pollution flow through current gutters, which directly enter Catalpa Creek.  \nReplacing Turf with Pollinator Habitat.  Sites designed to attract numerous types of \ninsect pollinators - non-native European honeybee (Apis mellifera) and native \nbumblebees (Bombus spp.) - should be implemented in replacement of maintained turf \nand hardscapes. Potential plant material may include those detailed in Table 11.3.1. \nMilkweeds (Asclepias spp.) are especially attractive for the monarch butterfly (Danaus \nplexippus). Both annuals that reseed themselves and perennials that persist several \nyears are included. \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   100 \n \nTable 11.3.1. Native Plant Material for Pollinator Habitat at Mississippi State University’s Catalpa Creek Restoration \nProject. \nCOMMON NAME SCIENTIFIC NAME GROWTH CYCLE \nLanced Leaved Coreopsis Coreopsis lanceolata perennial \nPurple Coneflower Echinacea purpurea perennial \nIndian Blanket Gaillardia pulchella annual \nScarlet Sage Salvia coccinea annual, perennial \nTickseed Sunflower Bidens polylepis anuual, biennial \nGolden Alexander Zizia aurea perennial \nButterfly Milkweed Asclepias tuberosa perennial \nClasping Coneflower Rudbeckia amplexicaulis annual \nLemon Mint Monarda citriodora annual \nSmooth Aster Aster laevis perennial \nSwamp Sunflower Helianthus angustifolius  \nSpotted Beebalm Monarda punctata annual, biennial, perennial  \nBlack-Eyed Susan Rudbeckia hirta annual, biennial, perennial  \nSmooth Penstemon Penstemon digitalis perennial \nPlains Coreopsis Coreopsis tinctoria annual \n \nDiversity in all things is key to pollinator success within human disturbed areas. We call \nthis “Reconciliation ecology.” Essentially, we’re trying to modify human habitats in order \nto make them better for wild species.  \nOther key goals may include: \n1. Provide nesting habitat. Most evidence suggests that flowering plant material is only \npart of the solution. There are around 4,000 species of bees in the US. Some nest in \nfallen timber; others are ground nesting; still others burrow into wooden structures.  \n2. Plant diverse stands of plant material: multiple colors, long and short duration of \nbloom, and different seasonal bloom times (early spring to late fall). \n12 MONITORING, MODELING, RESEARCH, AND ASSESSMENT \n12.1 WATER RESOURCES \n \nMonitoring and modeling will be performed by University researchers with possible \nsupport from USGS and MDEQ.  Monitoring includes routine and event-based assessment \nof water quantity and quality, as well as the assessment of biological conditions, stream \nchannel, plant community indicators, and social indicators.  Integrated modeling of \nexisting watershed hydrology and runoff and stream water quality, stream hydraulics and \nsediment transport, and channel morphology conditions will be performed to identify \nmost critical non-point source areas, dominant mechanisms driving sediments and \nnutrients supply within the watershed and corrections needed to improve streams and \nwatershed quality. A second modeling effort is planned to predict changes associated \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   101 \n \nwith typical stream restoration design scenarios and proposed implementation of BMPs \nat channel and watershed level.  \nWater Quality/Quantity.  The approach for evaluating outcomes, including plans for \nmonitoring and modeling, and for reporting on progress to achieve the objectives of this \napplication leverage several complimentary approaches and strategies, including EPA’s \nHandbook for Developing Watershed Plans and Mississippi's State-level Strategies to \nReduce Nutrients and Associated Pollutants (identified below): \n1. Determine appropriate spatial and temporal scales;  \n2. Determine appropriate reference period (assess system dynamics in determining \nthe reference frame; evaluate hydrologic period of record; incorporate existing \nmonitoring information);  \n3. Identify management practices to be implemented (identify the management \npractices to be monitored and consider the attributes of these management \npractices); \n4. Establish monitoring site locations (consider multiple options; leverage funding of \nsite locations with other agencies/organizations and partner on selecting \nmonitoring parameters and reporting);   \n5. Select what will be monitored (match the monitoring parameters with the project \nobjectives and the management practices; include biological as well as \nphysicochemical parameters so relationships can be established between the \nbiological or stream response and implemented practices);  \n6. Establish sampling frequency (integrate watershed, site, and hydrologic \ncharacteristics with desired outcomes from the implemented practices; ensure \nmonitoring occurs over the annual hydrograph); \n7. Provide analysis and assessment of results (establish an information management \nsystem to store information; consider the analyses to be performed as part of the \nmonitoring program design such as watershed/stream modeling, geomorphic \nanalyses, land use/nutrient loading, biotic/nutrient or other statistical \nrelationships, status & trends analyses, etc.; assess the monitoring network \nperiodically for effectiveness and relevancy); \n8. Establish and document data QA/QC (ensure that all data quality objectives and \nquality assurance project plans are prepared and approved prior to initiating \nmonitoring; conduct quality assurance and quality control protocols as part of \nfield, laboratory, analysis, and modeling activities); and  \n9. Design the monitoring program to be sustainable and adaptable (refine and \nimprove the monitoring approach and network as additional information becomes \navailable).  \nMonitoring water quality and quantity will occur at various locations throughout the \nwatershed, determined based on tributary delineations and land use maps, to identify \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   102 \n \npriority areas, which are likely to overlap priority areas for BMP implementation; and \noffer an opportunity for pre and post-BMP assessment. This approach will provide \nmeasureable outcomes following priorities of the EPA 9 elements objectives (Figure \n12.1.1, Figure 12.1.2, Figure 12.1.3). Water quality/quantity monitoring and assessment \nactivities will include: \n Determination of nutrient inputs based on existing management policies (R. \nMoore); \n Assessment and variability of streams hydrology and hydraulic characteristics  (B. \nBaker, J. Ramirez-Avila, J. Martin, C. Siegert);  \n Identification of transport paths and trends, and mechanisms driving sediments \nand nutrient supply and exportation within and from the watershed (J. Ramirez-\nAvila; B. Baker);  \n Assessment and variability of sediment and nutrient concentrations and other \nwater quality parameters in runoff, stream water, and streambed sediment \n(Water Quality Lab, Kelly Gene Cook Environmental Engineering Lab);  \n Testing incubation methods for sediment oxygen demand and nutrient release \nfrom streambed sediment (J. Martin, J. Ramirez-Avila, Kelly Gene Cook \nEnvironmental Engineering Lab) \n Assessment of Pathogens levels in stream water (USDA Microbiology Lab- J. \nBrooks);  \n Monitoring precipitation on the MSU campus (located on the South Farm Facility) \nto include in modeling efforts towards calculating surface runoff, hydrologic \ncharacteristics, and nutrient, sediment, and pathogen loads (Chris Fuhrman & \nJamie Dyer); and \n Land use characterization at the time pre-monitoring begins, and during post-\nimplementation monitoring will be critical to determine land use changes/ \nchanges in impervious surfaces contributing to runoff, especially as major \nconstruction projects on the MSU campus adjacent to the headwaters is expected \nto continue throughout the Catalpa Creek Watershed Project. \nA two tier integrated watershed and channel modeling effort is considered to support \nwatershed management and stream restoration activities and watershed responses to \nrestoration and BMPs implementation. Modeling efforts will consider:  \nWatershed modeling will be performed to simulate and predict runoff and stream flow, and \nsediment and nutrient transport conditions for the existing baseline scenario; identify critical \nareas of non-point source pollution and priority areas for BMPs implementation; and evaluate \nthe watershed response post-implementation of BMPs and typical stream restoration design \nscenarios within the Catalpa Creek watershed. The modeling approach will combine the \ncomputational programs Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) and the Soil and \nWater Assessment Tool (SWAT). \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   103 \n \nModeling stream hydraulics, sediment transport, and channel morphology will support a \nfoundational understanding towards the role in-stream \n\nprocesses have as a mechanism driving \nsediment and nutrient supply and exportation within and from the watershed; identify optimal \nstream restoration priority options and develop stream restoration design scenarios to be \nimplemented along segments to be restored; and predict stream and watershed changes \nassociated with proposed typical stream restoration design scenarios. Modeling will be \nperformed combining the use of the tools River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), Conservational \nChannel Evolution and Pollutant Transport System (CONCEPTS), and Bank Stability and Toe \nErosion Model (BSTEM). \n \nFigure 12.1.1.

Current monitoring efforts include \navian demographic research, watersnake ecology and water quality monitoring, breeding \namphibian research, and pond turtle ecology. In addition to these activities, monitoring \napproaches will be developed to evaluate invasive species in the watershed as well as the \nhabitat/ecosystem restoration projects facilitated as a result of this plan.  \nManagement Indicator Species and Their Value in Determining Positive Outcomes. The \npresence, location, and quality of stream buffer habitat directly impacts the restoration of \nstream physical properties (Shields et al., 2006). In-stream monitoring programs \ndescribed in this plan address water quality and water quantity concerns. The inclusion of \nhabitat assessment and the role of habitat restoration on in-stream processes will also be \nexplored. The planning and management of plant communities and the associated \nresponses of avian, herpetofaunal, and insect indicator species will be monitored and \nused to adaptively manage the riparian communities in the watershed.  For example, \nhabitat provided by the Red Bud – Catalpa Creek watershed is ideally suited for species \nthat are indicators for positive impacts of restoration efforts in the watershed. A variety \nof bird species, yellow-bellied watersnakes, breeding amphibians, pond turtle, and ant \nresearch programs on the MSU South Farm will contribute vital information regarding the \nsuccess of restoration efforts and provide information for the adaptive management of \nupland and riparian projects throughout the watershed. \nAvian Indicators. Collecting information on survival and recruitment for Eastern Bluebirds \n(Sialia sialis), E. Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), E. Kingbirds (Tyrannus tyrannus), \ngrassland Sparrows (Ammodramus spp.), Chickadees (Poecile spp.), Titmice (Baeolophus \nspp.), Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), and American Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) \nin the watershed provides information critical for determining causes of population \nchanges and for identifying management actions and conservation strategies to reverse \npopulation declines for birds that make use of similar habitats. Several large-scale, long-\nterm monitoring programs provide annual information on landbird populations. Although \nestablished programs such as the Breeding Bird Survey and Christmas Bird count provide \ninformation on species population trends, these programs fail to provide information on \ndemographic parameters or vital rates of landbirds. Valuable information on demographic \nprocess and vital rates are missing for bird species within our geographic area.  \nA secondary benefit of establishing a banding and monitoring program for birds in close \nproximity to MSU is that it provides an educational opportunity for students. An integral \npart of the learning process for ecology and field studies is the ability to see and learn \nabout ecological communities and community members. Access to these opportunities is \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   106 \n \ngreatly facilitated by the use of non-harmful sampling employed at natural locations. \nHerein, students will be trained in proper banding techniques and the skills required in re-\nsighting color-banded birds.  \nSince 2014, students at Mississippi State University enrolled in the Department of \nWildlife, Fisheries, & Aquaculture, as well as those involved in student organizations such \nas the Wildlife Society, have been involved in the development of a bluebird trail of nest \nboxes located within Mississippi State University’s South Farm property. Each spring \nstudents monitor bird activity at these boxes, noting productivity, survivorship and \nrecruitment within the population. Through bird-banding, students can also track the \nsurvival and movements of birds among years and across the landscape. Morphological \ninformation collected from nestling birds and adults can also be tied to habitat change \nand resource availability. This data will provide a long-term monitoring platform by which \nto gauge landscape change, enhanced educational opportunities, and training for \nstudents through MSU classwork and individual-based projects. \nReptilian Indicator.  Significant wetland area is lost in the United States each year (Dahl, \n1990). Wetland loss can occur through direct conversion, or alteration of supporting \nprocesses. Wetlands where natural processes have been altered include many small \nstreams that run through agricultural fields. Loss of hydrologic function and connectivity \nof emergent and/or adjacent habitats is commonplace within these agricultural lands. \nMany species endemic to these wetland systems are affected by these changes. The \nSouth Farm is a home for the yellow-belled watersnake (Nerodia erythrogaster \nflavigaster), a species which can help us to understand wetland ecosystems and \nmanagement for many related species. Although common within southeastern stream \nsystems, this species can be used as a model organism by which we can understand the \nimpacts of wetland habitat connectivity and landscape configuration on other wetland \nendemic species. In this study, since 2014, students within the herpetology class offered \nthrough Mississippi State University’s Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Aquaculture \nhave applied radio-telemetry to the yellow-bellied watersnake, tracking them through \nmultiple seasons, corresponding with periods of flood and low water as a means of \nunderstanding this species' use of wetland boundary habitats.  \nUnderstanding habitat use is essential to conservation planning. Using surrogate species, \nor those whose presence reflects qualities of a larger taxonomic group, can provide \ninformation relevant to a spectrum of species without conducting similar research on \neach; yellow-bellied watersnake can be treated as this surrogate species. Yellow-bellied \nwatersnake, although common in many southeastern stream habitats, are difficult to \ncensus and nearly impossible to follow over large distances. Advances in radio-telemetry \nhave furthered our understanding of snake ecology, enabling us to gain observations of \nanimal behavior during discrete time periods and relative to certain environmental \nevents.  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   107 \n \nSince 2014, coupled with radio-telemetry, blood samples have been collected from \nsnakes captured at Mississippi State University’s South Farm location, and elsewhere. \nBlood samples have been screened for parasites, providing a correlative link between \ntrophic breadth, parasite burden, habitat structure and water quality. Information \ncollected provides information on habitat management and efficacy towards wetland \nenhancement. Linking water quality to snake diet and parasite burden will afford time-\nintegrated information by which to monitor linkages to habitat remediation, restoration \nand conservation. \nAmphibian Indicators. Determining the presence of various frogs and toads as it relates to \nhabitat remediation and restoration within the watershed provides another avenue to \ngauge ecosystem health. Anuran vocalization surveys are a common method for \nmonitoring the occurrence of populations of amphibians (Nelson & Graves, 2004, Weir et \nal., 2005). Data collectors must be trained to properly identify the calls of various taxa \nand understand data collection techniques as well as species-habitat interactions. Such \ntraining can provide an exceptional pedagogical tool for teaching students about anuran \necology, while also collecting valuable information about what species exist within a \nparticular landscape. \nSince 2014, students enrolled in the Herpetology class offered through Mississippi State \nUniversity’s Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, & Aquaculture have been conducting \nseason amphibian call surveys within the Catalpa Creek Watershed. These surveys, \nconducted through three repeated visits each spring provide a means for monitoring \nchange in species assemblage and calling phenology within the watershed. These studies \nprovide a platform for monitoring changes in anuran assemblage and calling phenology \nrelative to habitat remediation and restoration within the watershed. This program will \nalso afford an educational tool by which to teach students proper survey techniques, \nexperimental design and an appreciation of anuran and conservation ecology. \nPond Turtle Landscape and Trophic Indicators.  Ponds afford a unique opportunity to \nexplore ecosystem and population processes. Functional traits, such as diet and \npopulation attributes can mediate ecosystem processes within ponds (Polis et al., 1997). \nAquatic ecosystems can also be linked to surrounding ecosystems by the movements of \nanimals (Polis et al., 1997, Roe et al., 2009). Determining the degree to which organisms \ninteract between different wetlands and the drivers of these interactions is fundamental \nto the assessment of ecological patterns, wetland conservation and ecosystem \nmanagement (Roe & Georges, 2007). \nIn the ponds and lakes of the southeastern United States, the biomass, density and \nannual productivity of turtles can equal or exceed that of other vertebrates (Iverson, \n1982, Congdon et al., 1986). Although turtles such as the slider (Trachemys scripta: \nhereafter, sliders) are considered omnivorous they can also switch to an herbivory or \ncarnivory depending on the quality and quantity of resources available (Clark & Gibbons, \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   108 \n \n1969, Aresco & James, 2005, Bouchard & Bjorndal, 2006); selecting specific habitats and \ndiet to optimize physiological and reproductive gains (Parmenter, 1980, Hart, 1983). By \nselecting for specific habitats sliders can influence pond ecosystem function and the \nproductivity of respective foodwebs (Lindsay, 2011).  \nThe purpose of the pond turtle monitoring effort is to determine the differences in pond \nsliders in an aquaculture setting versus a natural system. Using mark-recapture, stable \nisotope analysis and immune response measures we can determine what pond sliders are \neating in aquaculture ponds, how this may differ from more natural settings and whether \nambient conditions are linked to immune response. We will also photograph each turtle \nfor use in identifying individuals and addressing color pattern intensity relative to immune \nresponse. \nThis research will help elucidate patterns in landscape ecology and wetland connectivity. \nCollectively, this information will help extend our understanding of species physiologic \nand trophic relationships within aquaculture systems versus natural systems. Enhanced \neducational opportunity will also be provided to students through research opportunity \nand datasets that can be used by future classes at Mississippi State University (including \nHerpetology and Biometrics). Exemplary future projects can use established methods to \nexplore slider movements and diet relative to season and the breeding status of \nindividual turtles. \nInsect Indicators. The survey of ants in the preserve is ongoing, and thus far has only \nbeen conducted in the southern unit of the Preserve.  However, 30 species of ants have \nbeen documented in this small patch of forest so far (Table 12.2.1).  The ant species \ninhabiting the preserve are typical of forested habitats in the region, but the level of \nspecies diversity present in a relatively small area demonstrates that even small patches \nof forest are capable of supporting a relatively diverse ant community.  The ant \ncommunity of the northern unit is expected to be more depauperate due to its smaller \nsize, soil conditions, and the effects of cattle grazing on the understory. \nTable 12.2.1.

This will likely be the case when considering restoration and \nprotection of the Catalpa Creek Watershed. The social dimension plays a key role in this \nscenario. Every individual, community and culture has a set of beliefs and attitudes that \nguide decision-making and influence behavior.  Because the success of watershed \nrestoration and protection efforts often depends upon a large percentage of watershed \nstakeholders understanding both the water quality impacts of their land use activities and \nthe importance of conservation, an important measure of progress should include \nconfirming that awareness and attitudes are changing and behaviors are being adopted \nthat serve to mitigate the problem. Social indicators provide consistent measures of social \nchange and can be used by planners and managers at all scales to estimate the impacts of \ntheir efforts and resources even while a lag exists for monitored improvements in water \nand habitat quality. In addition, social indicators can inform planners and managers of \nchanges needed to their strategies to increase the effectiveness of their efforts.   \n \nThe formulation of effective engagement, outreach and educational programs also \nrequires an understanding of the underlying beliefs and values of various target \naudiences. Through the use of social science survey instruments, the underlying beliefs \nand values of selected target audiences will be surveyed at the watershed scale to serve \nas a basis for effective engagement, technology transfer, education and outreach and to \nserve as a reference to gauge the effectiveness of these efforts.  \n12.4 DATA MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION    \nThe variety and amount of data to be collected for this project will require effective data \nassimilation, organization, and management. Because of this, a data management plan \nwill be developed at the beginning of the project to guide our efforts. The plan will be \nconsistent with MSU policies and requirements of potential resource agencies and other \nfunding organizations. \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   110 \n \n13 EDUCATION, EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND OUTREACH \n13.1 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES \n \nThe educational goal of this plan is to enhance awareness and knowledge of watershed \nissues in local, regional and national stakeholders and increase use of watershed \nconservation/management practices through educational programs associated with the \nimplementation and assessment of best management practices in the Catalpa Creek \nWatershed. This goal will be achieved by: \n Demonstrating the effectiveness and benefits of sediment, nutrient, pathogen and \nother Best Management Practices and water management approaches to a \ndiverse audience of stakeholders; \n Providing for information and technology transfer of current and future watershed \nmanagement applications to water resources planners, resource managers, \nconsumers, University students, agricultural producers, and other stakeholders; \nand \n Increasing the use of BMP and other watershed protection practices by producers, \nmunicipalities and rural/urban residents. \nWe expect that the education, experiential learning and outreach activities listed in this \nsection will not only provide an effective component for Catalpa Creek work, but will also \nlay the foundation upon which the Watershed D.R.E.A.M.S. Center will be established. \n13.2 ACTIVITIES & MILESTONES \n \nTable 13.2.1.

Effective education begins with an understanding \nof the knowledge base, perceptions, misconceptions, and educational needs of the \ntarget audience.  Therefore, a needs assessment of key stakeholders including \ncommunity/municipal leaders, watershed residents, agricultural producers, public \neducators (both formal and non-formal), and land-associate resource and financial \norganizations and agencies (e.g., NRCS, FSA, Delta F.A.R.M., Farm Bureau) will be \nconducted prior to intensive development of educational and outreach programs.  \nFurthermore, a survey to assess existing programs which may be leveraged to promote \nthe objectives of this plan will be conducted. \n \nUniversity Outreach.  Since a part of the Mississippi State University campus is located \nwithin the Catalpa Creek Watershed, there is the unique opportunity to provide \nrelevant, experiential learning to undergraduate and graduate students.  The close \nproximity of students, instructors, and researchers to watershed features allows for \ndemonstration (both of impairments and mitigation approaches), case study, land use \nplanning, research, and monitoring learning experiences. In this manner, local \nwatershed restoration, research and conservation is enhanced and future conservation \nefforts beyond the confines of this plan are impacted. \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   112 \n \nAs a land grant university with Carnegie Foundation Designations of both Very High \nResearch Activity and Community Engagement, Mississippi State University has a long \nhistory of collaboration with other educational institutions from across the U.S. and \nworld.  Implementation of plan activities will result in development of a model site \nhighlighting the benefits of watershed research and protection, community engagement \nand environmental stewardship.  Outreach to institutions may promote collaborative \npartnerships and replication at other locations, resulting in further watershed \nprotection, citizen engagement, and research benefits.  \n \nPublic Outreach.  The public stakeholder group is a large and diverse target audience \ncomprised of civic leaders, neighborhood associations, youth groups, community \norganizations, landowners, and producers.  Consequently, a diverse portfolio of \neducation and outreach approaches will be incorporated and developed to meet their \nneeds, as informed by the stakeholder survey.  Selected activities will be designed to \nincrease awareness and knowledge of watershed and water quality issues, mitigation \napproaches, socioeconomic and environmental benefits, and sustainability practices. \n \nOutreach to Educators.  Although there are positive gains to be made through outreach \nto individuals and small groups, employing a “train the trainer” model is decidedly more \nefficient. Therefore, outreach to those with education responsibilities will be a key \ncomponent of implementation of the outreach and education efforts associated with \nthe Catalpa Creek Watershed Plan.   \n \nTeachers in public and private schools, youth development (e.g., 4-H and FFA) leaders, \nand natural resources educators are tasked with improving learner knowledge; this is \noften best accomplished by showing real-world relevance of the content to the learner.  \nCurricula and educational activities centered on watershed stewardship provide an \nexcellent opportunity to satisfy multi-faceted, educational objectives.   \n \nOutreach to Conservation Organizations and Land Managers.  Natural resources \nagencies and entities such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Soil and \nWater Conservation Districts, Farm Service Agency, Farm Bureau, and Department of \nEnvironmental Quality interface with public and private land owners on a variety of \ntopics related to natural resource use.   Providing current, research-based information \non best management practices, incentive programs, and benefits of sound \nenvironmental stewardship improves and enhances adoption and implementation. \n13.3 PARTICIPANTS & AFFILIATIONS \nTable 13.3.1.

To pursue sustainability is to create and maintain the conditions under \nwhich humans and nature can exist in productive harmony to support present and future \ngenerations. Growing pressure on water resources – from population and economic \ngrowth, climate change, pollution, and other challenges – has major impacts on our \nsocial, economic, and environmental well-being. These challenges are compounded by \nour inability to balance human needs with the needs of the natural world. Healthy \necosystems and environments are necessary to the survival of humans and other \norganisms. \nThe United States is committed to sustainability, declaring it a national policy “to create \nand maintain conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive \nharmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic and other requirements of present \nand future generations.”    \n \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   114 \n \n14.2 ADDRESSING SUSTAINABILITY \n \n \nSustainable watershed management integrates ecologic, economic, and social \napplications that restore and protect habitat/ecosystem health, water quality, and water \nquantity through effective land management. This is most often accomplished through \nthe development and implementation of watershed-scale plans and projects designed to \nsustain and enhance watershed functions that affect the plant, animal, and human \ncommunities within a watershed. \nThis Catalpa Creek Watershed Restoration and Protection Project is designed to achieve  \nsustainability – in terms of habitat/ecosystem health, water quality, water quantity, and \nthe continuance of concerted, collaborative efforts to involve watershed stakeholders in \nthe restoration and protection activities as well as to attain the resources necessary for \nthe sustenance of the project. This will be addressed in various ways that are discussed \nbelow.  \nSustainability Index Concept.  What happens when the money runs out? In Mississippi, as \nin other states whose watershed management programs are dependent upon 319 NPS \nfunding, this is a challenging and perplexing issue. In its infancy, Mississippi’s Basin \nManagement Approach conceptualized using 319 NPS funding as “seed money” to attract \nother investment. This has been successful in some respects, such as the significant \namount of leveraging with NRCS programs and other resources to implement \nMississippi’s Nutrient Reduction Strategies. However, because of the need for 319 \nfunding support across the state, the limits on the length of its use for specific projects, \nand reliance on it as a leveraging tool, most often when 319-funded components of \nwatershed-based projects are completed, the projects largely fade away if the funding is \nnot renewed. Also, because 319 NPS funding has been used primarily for restoration, \nonce the water quality of a watershed is restored, funding to support follow-up \nprotection efforts as well as for protection of watersheds exhibiting good quality presents \na dilemma that has not yet been solved.  \nThe Mississippi Water Resources Research Institute (MWRRI) and the Social Sciences \nResearch Center (SSRC), both housed at MSU, have developed a concept to develop a \nSustainability Index (SI) that would have local and statewide utility in supporting \nwatershed-based restoration and protection projects. Through scientifically-developed \nsurvey methods, scalable surveys could be collaboratively developed with MDEQ and \nimplemented by SSRC to address key sustainability issues and identify and rank potential \nlocal support for implementation of a watershed-based restoration and/or protection \neffort. Additionally, mining of available information sources (e.g., enHance) will yield \nbeneficial information. Some of the key components/issues regarding sustainability at the \nlocal watershed level could be addressed through responses to the following survey \nquestions that would be integrated into the survey to understand stakeholder behaviors, \nperceptions, and beliefs (previously discussed). \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   115 \n \n Who are the potential local champions? Who are the influencers? \n Who can provide local support? What type of support? What businesses and local \norganizations could benefit from providing support? What types of benefits?  \n Who is already engaged in supporting environmental protection activities? What \ntype of support are they providing? \n What incentives exist for local stakeholder and business support? What incentives \ncould be developed to foster local stakeholder and business support for a \nwatershed-based project?  \n How can you keep local champions and business support “fresh” and engaged? \n What is the best way to inform and engage potential partners? How do they get \ntheir information?  \nThese and other questions will require analysis as well as development of a recruitment \nstrategy. In some cases, follow-up interviews could be arranged and conducted.  \nAt the state level, this approach could be used to identify and rank watersheds through \ndevelopment of a sustainability index which could be integrated into a statewide \nprioritization framework. The index could be scalable, from ranking sustainability at the \nstate wide, basin wide, or watershed wide scale. Also, the index would help with \ndetermining the likelihood of business support and incentives for sustained support at a \nlocal watershed level. Social indicators can assess the effectiveness of the index and show \nwhere modifications may be necessary. \nNeighborhood Water Watch/Watershed Sentinels.  Under consideration for this project \nis the establishment of a neighborhood water watch/watershed sentinel program built \nupon the concept of the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper (GA) Neighborhood Water Watch. It \nis designed to engage and educate the watershed community while working to eliminate \nbacteria pollution in the Chattahoochee River, a public health concern. The effort focuses \non inexpensive volunteer bacteria monitoring by local watershed stakeholders. The \nprogram has five goals.  \n1. Increase public awareness of water quality issues and local waterway \nconditions. \n2. Provide citizen groups with tools and training to protect their local waterways. \n3. Collect quality baseline data. \n4. Form new partnerships between citizen groups, non-profit organizations and \ngovernment agencies. \n5. Address and resolve poor water quality detected during monitoring. \n \nThe Catalpa Creek Watershed also has bacteria/pathogens concerns and monitoring \nneeds. Such a program could enhance stakeholder participation and create experiential \nlearning activities.  \n \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   116 \n \nMaintenance of Best Management Practices.  A key component of sustainability from \nthe context of water quality and habitat/ecosystem health is the effective maintenance of \nthe BMPs to restore and/or protect these resources. Contained in the work plan in \nSection 11 is the provision of MSU supporting the Oktibbeha County Soil & Water \nConservation District, MSWCC, and NRCS efforts with the field inspections and photo \ndocumentation of BMPs, and submission of standard maintenance agreements. \nAdditionally, a future revision to this plan will add a maintenance section to document \nthese activities.  \nMSU Office of Sustainability/Vision 2020.  In 2012, the Mississippi State University \nExecutive Council passed the \"Sustainability, Facilities Operation, Grounds, Materials, and \nTransportation\" policy. This policy sets standards and requirements for all building \ndevelopment, grounds management, transportation systems, and materials, following the \nsame frameworks established in MSU’s \nClimate Action Plan. MSU also \nestablished the Office of Sustainability \nto develop and implement \nmanagement, audit, retrofit, and new \nconstruction guidelines, policies, and \nprocedures. The Office of Sustainability \nhas four areas of focus: operations, \nmaterials, transportation, and grounds \n(Figure 14.2.1). Storm water, waste, \nlight and traffic pollution in addition to \nstandard grounds maintenance, parking \nlots, plantings, and hardscapes are part \nof the Office’s focus. Grounds \nincorporates both MSU’s local \nlandscape and the regional \nenvironment in order to set standards \nlocally that impact the greater ecological health of MSU’s surrounding environment.  \nVision 2020 is the development of a baselines, goals, and performance metrics to obtain \nand operate a sustainable campus with a 50% reduction in resource use and \nwaste/pollution production, a 50% increase in sustainable transit measures as well as \nrecycled activity, a 50% increase in sustainable curriculum and research activities, and a \n50% increase in community/university sustainable partnerships by the year 2020. These \ngoals were developed to serve as the basis for all campus planning activities. \nMSU also has a campus-wide recycling program for all papers, plastics, cardboards, and \nmetals; e-wastes; batteries; used engine, hydraulic, vacuum pump, lubricating, and \ncooking oils. \ngure 14.3 Four Major Areas of Focus of MSU’s \nOffice of Sustainability \nFigure 14.2.1. Four Major Areas of Focus of MSU’s Office of \nSustainability. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   117 \n \nWatershed D.R.E.A.M.S. Center.  Perhaps the greatest opportunities to foster sustainable \nwatershed management within the Catalpa Creek Watershed as well as the state and \nregional levels is the establishment of the Catalpa & Sand Creek Watershed D.R.E.A.M.S. \n(Demonstration, Research, Education, Application, Management and Sustainability) \nCenter. This project is described in Section 15.  \n15 CATALPA & SAND CREEK WATERSHED D.R.E.A.M.S. (DEMONSTRATION, \nRESEARCH, EDUCATION, APPLICATION, MANAGEMENT AND \nSUSTAINABILITY) CENTER \n15.1 VISION  \nDuring the January 13, 2015, exercise by the Catalpa Creek Project Steering Team not only \ndeveloped a vision for the restoration and protection project, but also a vision for a \nwatershed-based management demonstration learning\n\n center. This center, now referred \nby its acronym D.R.E.A.M.S. (for Demonstration, Research, Education, Application, \nManagement and Sustainability) Center will serve as a showcase for watershed \nmanagement in the State and Southeast through the watershed-based best management \npractices in the Catalpa Creek Watershed. This facility will be useful to state and federal \nagencies, water management districts, stakeholder and community service organizations, \nuniversity departments and programs, secondary education teachers and students, local \ngovernments, and others. Beyond complementing the Catalpa Creek Watershed \nRestoration & Protection Project, the Center will focus generally on water resources, \nwatersheds, and the ecosystem services they provide in a hands-on interactive way. The \ngoals of the center are to: \n Demonstrate a landscape approach to watershed management;  \n Demonstrate the implementation of Mississippi’s Uplands Nutrient Reduction \nStrategic Plan;  \n Demonstrate the implementation of a watershed-based pathogen reduction strategy;  \n Demonstrate the effectiveness of innovative and established sediment, nutrient, \npathogen and other Best Management Practices (BMPs); \n Advance research of innovative concepts and applications that address water \nresources and watershed management;   \n Provide for technology transfer of applications developed by MSU researchers to \nwater resources planners, managers, water users, and other stakeholders;  \n Educate water resource and watershed planners, managers, policy-makers, and other \nstakeholders about important watershed concepts; and  \n Demonstrate MSU’s capacity to effectively address a wide range of water resources \nand watershed issues occurring throughout the state and region.  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   118 \n \nAfter completion of this Water Resources Management Plan for the Catalpa Creek \nWatershed and the beginning of implementation activities, a companion effort will be \ninitiated to develop a Water Resources Management Plan for the adjacent Sand Creek \nWatershed which hosts MSU’s North Farm. Both watersheds and watershed restoration \nand protection plans will be leveraged with existing and planned MSU assets, such as \nProject W.E.T., the H.H. Leveck Animal Research Center, R.R. Foil Plant Science Research \nCenter, and Union Green to establish MSU’s Watershed D.R.E.A.M.S. Center.    \n15.2 CATALPA CREEK WATERSHED: A LANDSCAPE APPROACH \nWatersheds are rarely managed for just one purpose, such as erosion control or TMDL \nimplementation. Instead, research increasingly shows that watersheds serve many \nimportant functions and should be managed in a holistic fashion, including \nenvironmental, social and economic terms (Turner & Daily, 2008). Watersheds provide, \nfree of charge, many ecosystem services that would cost a community considerably if \nengineered separately: cleaning drinking water, filtering pollutants, cleaning air, serving \nas habitat for fisheries and other wildlife, cycling nutrients, mitigating temperatures, and \nrecreation. Healthy watersheds are also a cost-effective system for managing storm \nwater by preventing flooding, depositing sediments, treating runoff, and buffering \nnutrients (Dlugolecki, 2012).  \nBecause of increasing development at Mississippi State University and in the greater \nStarkville community, it is important that efforts are made now to restore and protect \nthe watersheds, by using smart growth practices and implementing low impact \ndevelopment practices that reduce watershed stress in the face of economic \ndevelopment.  Numerous benefits result from sound ecological design—using natural \nsystems patterns and processes. Creating healthy watersheds in this way has been \ndemonstrated to improve hydrology, water chemistry, hydromorphology, plant and \nanimal biota, and overall ecosystem services (Buijse, 2014).  \nA Case Study: PROJECT W.E.T., Dept. of Landscape Architecture, Mississippi State \nUniversity.  There is already an approved project on the Mississippi State University \ncampus for using ecological design for the establishment and management of a \nwatershed system. PROJECT W.E.T. (Wetland Education Theater) will be located at the \nintersection of Bully and Stone Boulevards (Figure 15.2.1). This 3-acre wetland education \narea designed will teach the public and the Mississippi State University community the \nvalues of wetland systems. \nProject W.E.T. is a collaborative effort between the College of Forest Resources and the \nDepartment of Landscape Architecture at Mississippi State University. Over 20 faculty \nand staff from 10 different departments contributed their expertise to the plan. Located \non open land east of Landscape Architecture and north of Thompson Hall, this effort \nendeavors to develop functional wetland ecosystems and associated upland \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   119 \n \ncommunities in the heart of MSU's campus. Connected by a flowing, serpentine walk \nand bridge network, numerous covered structures will dot the site, providing highly-\nvisible, interpretive displays for visitors. It is anticipated that Project W.E.T. will break \nground in 2016.  \n \nFigure 15.2.1. Project W.E.T. Location on the MSU Campus. \n \nFigure 15.2.2. Habitat Plan for Project W.E.T., Mississippi State University campus. \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   120 \n \nThe main designer and landscape architect for Project W.E.T., Robert Poore, PLA, of \nNative Habitats, Inc. in Flora, Mississippi used an ecological design process to inform the \ndesign and management for the new exhibit (Figure 15.2.2, Figure 15.2.3, Figure 15.2.4). \nHis visits to small, local wetland systems at the Sam Hamilton Noxubee National Wildlife \nRefuge and Tombigbee National Forest provided the precedence for the exhibit’s \nhabitats, hydrology, and interpretive elements. Researchers analyzed the exhibit site’s \nelevation, soils, aspect, and drainage. Analogues in the natural wetland communities \nwere then selected for exhibit inspiration and wetland function. With this approach, it is \nanticipated that visitors will develop a deeper understanding of wetlands by seeing their \nstructure and function and learning the components necessary for a healthy wetland.  \n \n \nFigure 15.2.3. Project W.E.T. master plan. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   121 \n \n \nFigure 15.2.4. Site Perspective of Project W.E.T. \nUsing a similar ecological design process, planners can efficiently design and implement \nthe Catalpa Creek Watershed Plan. Analogues found in area wetlands can help us \nunderstand hydrological, ecological, and environmental attributes needed the \nmitigation areas. By analyzing the soils, hydrology, plant communities, and physical \nattributes of local, natural sites, planners can provide ecological modules to guide the \ndesign/redevelopment of Catalpa Creek’s critical management zones. \n15.3 H.H. LEVECK ANIMAL RESEARCH CENTER (SOUTH FARM) \nThe eastern portion of MSU’s campus and its Leveck Animal Research Center are located \nin the headwaters of the Catalpa Creek Watershed. This presents numerous leveraging \nopportunities for the watershed project and the Watershed D.R.E.A.M.S. Center. The \n1,110+ acre H. H. Leveck Animal Research Center, commonly referred to as “South Farm,” \nprovides a very important land resource which supports departmental teaching and \nvarious research activities associated with Animal Science curriculum (Figure 15.3.1). The \ncenter is dedicated to livestock and forage production research, and is also used for \nresearch on innovative best management practices designed to mitigate pollution from \nlivestock operations. It provides the students of Animal and Dairy Sciences contact with \nmodern techniques in animal agriculture as well as the opportunity for practical work \nexperience. These experiments give the students insight into many technical challenges \nassociated with the animal production industry. \nThe largest percentage of acres on the center are dedicated to beef research and support \nof the base beef cattle herds. The second largest area on the center is the horse unit. The \nresearch and breeding program continues to grow along with the equine industry in the \nstate. The South Farm aquaculture research facility, is an 18-acre on-campus aquaculture \nfacility that provides opportunities to faculty, graduate students and undergraduates to \nconduct aquaculture related research. South Farm has close collaborative ties with the \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   122 \n \nUSDA-APHIS wildlife services unit as well as the Hill County Initiative through the USDA-\nARS. The South Farm also hosts NRCS’ Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative \ndemonstration area, the Poultry Science Research Unit, a bird facility, and an observatory \nmaintained and used by the Physics Department. \nThe Research Support Staff on the South Farm is responsible for land, labor, and \nequipment to aid research scientists in implementing their research projects. They are \nalso responsible for forage production grounds, water lines, perimeter fences and \nexteriors of buildings.   \n \nFigure 15.3.1. MSU South Farm. \n15.4 R.R. FOIL PLANT SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER \n The R. R. Foil Plant Science Research Center, known by many as North Farm, is comprised \nof approximately 750 acres. This facility includes 550 acres of tillable land for a variety of \nresearch projects in a diverse agricultural community. Some examples include: cotton, \nsoybeans, corn, sweet potatoes, grain sorghum, peanuts and many others. Along with \ntillable acreage, research is performed with turf, ornamentals and aquatic weeds/plants. \nThis facility furnishes the research scientists with necessary greenhouse environments, \nlaboratory needs and a variety of storage areas. The research support staff on this station \nis responsible for land assignments, labor, and equipment to aid researchers in \nimplementing their various protocols along with maintaining overall aesthetics of the \nentire facility. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   123 \n \n15.5 UNION GREEN DESIGN \nUnion Green is an award-winning site design to be used as a model for current green \ninfrastructure practices, displaying bio-retention cells, cisterns, pervious pavement, and a \nunique water conveyance system to efficiently and effectively manage storm water \nrunoff. The initial design plan centered on the 1.3 acre Union Green in the heart of \ncampus, however, the project is now planned for a site near Project W.E.T. To create a \nmulti-functional space, the team proposed a three-phase design. The first phase adds a \n1,000 gallon above-ground cistern, an aqueduct, and bioretention to the west side of the \nsite. The elevated aqueduct would provide visual water conveyance and irrigation, and \neducate passersby about storm water management. The design would manage the 95\nth\n \npercentile storm, and would reduce peak flows for the 2-year 24-hour storm below the \npre-development condition. This would reduce excessive flows downstream for all but \nthe most severe storm events. \n16 RESOURCE NEEDS, PROCUREMENT, AND LEVERAGING \nUltimately, the availability of resources will be the biggest factor in determining the success and \nsustainability of this project. Hence, a concerted effort is being made to identify and solicit \nfunding sources, recruit watershed stakeholder “champions,” and encourage local business \nsupport.  \n16.1 RESOURCE NEEDS  \nPreviously in this management plan, restoration, protection, education, monitoring, and \nother activities have been identified and the resource needs to implement these activities \nhave been estimated. These estimates represent an early “best guess” approach, based \nupon the best professional judgment of local conservationists. Using this approach, it is \nanticipated that at a minimum three-to-four years of implementation activities are \nneeded to restore the water quality and habitat/ecosystem health of the watershed. This \nwill be confirmed by monitoring activities. It is reasonable to assume that additional \nrestoration activities will be needed. Near-term activities will be to conduct baseline \nmonitoring, and prioritize sites in the headwaters and broad watershed for restoration. \nModeling may be used to inform BMP placement and guide expectations. Following \nrestoration, implementation of protection activities will be needed to sustain the \nprogress made in restoring the water quality and habitat/ecosystem health of the \nwatershed. These resource needs previously specified are compiled in Table 16.2.1.   \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   124 \n \nTable 16.1 Estimated Current Resource Needs  \nA.

The effort will involve \nmembers of the Steering Team and the Funding and Incentives Team. Traditional and \nnontraditional resources will be identified and pursued. The general process to be \nfollowed is listed below.  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   125 \n \n Resource identification/discovery;  \n Solicitation and procurement of resources;  \n Creation of incentives for local involvement and support; and  \n Recruitment of local government and the local business community.  \n \nResource Identification/Discovery.  Table 16.2.1 is being used as a first step for \nidentifying potential external resources to support this project. Subsequent steps will \ninclude reviewing a wide array of research, technical assistance, and educational funding \nopportunities as well. Efforts are also underway to identify internal MSU departmental or \nprogram-related funding opportunities and support. A representative of the MSU \nFoundation participates on the Funding and Incentives Team to provide guidance and \nsupport for efforts seeking resources from private sources.  \n \nNontraditional support will also be pursued. An example of nontraditional support that \nwill be pursued is MDEQ’s/EPA’s Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP) Program. \nUnder this program, alleged violators of regulatory requirements might be allowed to \npursue settlement agreements with MDEQ. As part of a settlement, an alleged violator \nmay voluntarily agree to undertake an environmentally beneficial project related to the \nviolation in exchange for mitigation of the penalty to be paid. Acceptable categories for \nthis program include public health, pollution prevention, pollution reduction, \nenvironmental restoration and protection, emergency planning and preparedness, \nassessments and audits, and environmental compliance promotion.  \nTable 16.2.1.

Members of the Funding and Incentives \nTeam will work with other functional team members and MSU faculty and administration \nto develop proposals, contracts and other instruments to address the resource needs of \nthis project. This will be an ongoing process.  \nCreation of Incentives for Local Involvement and Support.  Previously described in the \nSection 14 of this plan is an approach to identify local watershed “champions” and local \nbusinesses through implementation of a social science survey designed for multiple \napplications. Some of the key components/issues regarding sustainability at the local \nwatershed level could be addressed through responses to the following survey questions. \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   127 \n \n Who are the potential local champions? Who are the influencers? \n Who can provide local support? What type of support? What businesses and local \norganizations could benefit from providing support? What types of benefits?  \n Who is already engaged in supporting environmental protection activities? What \ntype of support are they providing? \n What incentives exist for local stakeholder and business support? What incentives \ncould be developed to foster local stakeholder and business support for a \nwatershed-based project?  \n How can you keep local champions and business support “fresh” and engaged?  \nThese and other questions will require analysis as well as development of an incentives \npackage and a recruitment strategy. This will be developed by the Funding and Incentives \nTeam and presented to the Steering Team.  \nRecruitment of the Local Business Community and Local Government.  Where positive \nsurvey responses are received, follow-up interviews could be arranged and conducted to \ndiscuss incentives (e.g., recognition, designations, awards, et al) and solicit support from \nthe local business community. Mining of available information sources that can yield \nbeneficial information (e.g., MDEQ’s enHance Program, Chamber of Commerce, et al) will \nalso be pursued to identify potential local support.  \nA concerted effort will also be made to involve local county and municipal government \nsupport. MSU has excellent relations with these local entities. In fact, several current or \nformer City of Starkville Alderman are already working on this project.   \n16.3 RESOURCE LEVERAGING  \n \nAs a matter of practice, we will pursue as many avenues as possible to leverage all \nresources. There are numerous resources that may be available to support this project. \nThis includes substantial MSU activities, programs, and assets as well as external \neducational programs, media, monitoring programs, and BMP cost-share programs from \nother sources.  \nMSU Activities, Programs, and Assets to Be Leveraged.  Table 16.3.1 lists some of the \nMSU activities, programs, assets, and services that will be leveraged with the Catalpa \nCreek Watershed Restoration and Protection Project and the Watershed D.R.E.A.M.S. \nCenter. Near-term plans are to estimate and track the costs of these activities and \nservices. \n  \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   128 \n \nTable 16.3.1.

Many factors are at play: resource availability’s impact on \nproject scale, knowledge gained as the plan is implemented, recognition of new needs and \nopportunities as the plan unfolds, and monitoring results filling gaps. Because of this, it is likely \nthat this plan will be revised and updated periodically. In fact, it is anticipated that the first plan \nrevision could occur sooner rather than later as more details are developed and resources \nbecome available for the establishment of the Watershed D.R.E.A.M.S. Center. For the first five \nyears this plan will be reviewed and revised, if necessary, annually. \n \n18 REFERENCES \nAresco, M. J. and F. C.

During this effort, MSU will work with the \nTennessee River/North Independent Streams/Tombigbee River Basin Team and will put \nforth its best effort to perform the tasks identified below within the given timetable.   \n1. In the event of a 319 NPS funding award from MDEQ to support implementation of \nthis Water Resources Management Plan for the Catalpa Creek Watershed, MSU shall \nwork with MDEQ to develop, execute, and implement a Sub-grant Agreement that \nspecifies the roles, tasks, requirements, and milestones of MSU. (Month 1)  \n \n2. MSU, in coordination with MDEQ and other partners, shall facilitate meetings and \ncoordinate activities of the functional teams and work groups created as a part of \nthis project to fully implement this plan. MSU shall in a timely manner notify MDEQ \nproject officer(s) of all project site locations, inspections, and/or public meetings so \nthat MDEQ project representatives may have the opportunity to attend. (Months 1 – \n42)  \n \n3. MSU shall work through its functional teams with the Oktibbeha County Soil & \nWater Conservation District, MSWCC, NRCS and MDEQ to inform landowners and \noperators within the watershed about the project and shall work to secure \ncommitments from priority area landowners and operators who are willing to \nparticipate in the project. Special emphasis will be given to small farms, limited \nresource farmers, and beginning farmers. (Months 1 – 24)  \n \n4. MSU, in coordination with MDEQ and other partners, shall develop and conduct a \npre-project survey designed to understand the behaviors, perceptions and beliefs of \nwatershed stakeholders as a basis for developing social indicators that could be used \nto help evaluate the success of the project, implementing effective education and \noutreach, identifying local watershed champions that could provide local leadership, \nand determine potential local economic and governmental interests and incentives \nthat could foster sustainable management of the watershed. (Months 1 – 3)  \n \n5. MSU shall work through its functional teams with the Oktibbeha County Soil & \nWater Conservation District, MSWCC, NRCS and MDEQ to determine through GIS \napplications and intensive site surveys the priority areas or sub-watersheds within \nthe watershed that are contributing significant pollutant loads for the purpose of \nselecting, siting, and planning for the implementation of appropriate best \nmanagement practices (BMPs) identified in this plan to mitigate pollution in the \nwatershed. All BMPs shall be installed in accordance with the guidelines developed \nin the latest edition of the NRCS Technical Field Manual, or other approved \nguidelines. (Months 1 – 24)  \n \n6. MSU, in cooperation with MDEQ and other monitoring partners, shall facilitate the \ncompletion and implementation of an effective and efficient plan to monitor \n\n \n \nWRMP for Red Bud – Catalpa Creek Watershed_Final   137 \n \nbaseline water quality conditions in the watershed and track changes in water \nquality over time resulting from the BMPS implemented through this project. \n(Completion: Months 1 – 2; Implementation: Months 3 – 42)  \n \n7. MSU shall hold a regional workshop on watershed management in conjunction with \nother collaborating universities, especially historically black land grant universities, \nand other educational institutions and stakeholder groups. Publish Proceedings of \nthe workshop within 12 months after the workshop is held. (Workshop: Months 1-\n12; Proceedings: Months 13-24) \n \n8. MSU shall coordinate with and support the Oktibbeha County Soil & Water \nConservation District, MSWCC, and NRCS with submission of blank copies of \nstandard maintenance agreements to MDEQ. (Months 13 – 36)  \n \n9. MSU shall assist MDEQ’s project officer(s) in conducting inspections during \nconstruction. (Months 6 – 36)  \n \n10. MSU shall coordinate with and support the Oktibbeha County Soil & Water \nConservation District, MSWCC, and NRCS in the collection of relevant GPS \ncoordinates of all installed BMPs and incorporate this information into a GIS format. \nAll geospatial data shall be collected in a manner consistent with the Federal \nGeographic Data Committee-endorsed standards. (Months 9 – 36)  \n \n11. MSU shall submit biannual reports not later than September 25\nth\n and March 25\nth\n of \neach year showing status of tasks and start/completion dates of each task. (Months \n1 – 42)  \n \n12. MSU shall assure that adequate photo documentation is taken before, during, and \nafter installation of the approved BMPs. (Months 1 – 42)  \n \n13. MSU, in coordination with MDEQ and other partners, shall develop and conduct a \npost-project survey designed to understand potential changes in the behaviors, \nperceptions and beliefs of watershed stakeholders resulting from implementation of \nthis plan evaluate the social indicators developed for the project. (Months 36 – 42)  \n \n14. MSU shall make project presentations as requested by MDEQ (Months 1 – 42)  \n \n15. MSU through its functional teams shall submit a final report to MDEQ to include \nmeasured, or estimated, nonpoint source pollutant load reduction or water quality \nimprovements, acreage affected, pre and post site conditions, GIS data, and social \nindicators developed and evaluated to determine project success. MSU shall make \nrevisions, if necessary, upon the request of MDEQ (Month 42).  ",
