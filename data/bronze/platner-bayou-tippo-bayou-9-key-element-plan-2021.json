According to the 2019 \nNational Land Cover Database (NLCD), the landuse within this watershed is comprised of \napproximately 67% cropland, 13% wetlands, 10% forestland, and 10% other (water, \nscrub/barren, pastureland and urban) (Figure 1).  This watershed is unique in the fact that part of \nit lies within the Bluff Hills ecoregion and the other part is in the Mississippi Alluvial Plains \notherwise referred to as the Mississippi Delta.  Only 14% of the watershed falls within the Bluff \nHills Region of the Yazoo Basin while the majority of the watershed, 86%, is located within the \nMississippi Delta.  The location of the watershed places the Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou \nwatershed into three different ecoregions.  The Bluff Hills ecoregion contains the eastern 4,379 \nacres of the watershed. The Northern Holocene Meander Belts makes up about 912 acres along \nthe western edge of the watershed and the central part of the watershed (25,925 acres) is in the \nNorthern Pleistocene Valley Trails ecoregion. The change in ecoregions from the Buff Hills to \nthe other two ecoregions can also be seen in Figure 1.  The changes in ecoregions corresponds \nwith drastic changes in landuse as the hilly upland area falls off into the flatter land commonly \nfound in the Mississippi and is used primarily for agricultural purposes.   \n \nThe water-use classification for all water bodies in this watershed, as established by Regulations \nfor Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters, is for Fish and Wildlife. \nWaters with this classification are intended for fishing and propagation of fish, aquatic life, and \nwildlife. Waters that that are classified as Fish and Wildlife should also be suitable for secondary \ncontact recreation, which is defined as incidental contact with water including wading and \noccasional swimming.  \n \nWaterbodies within the Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed have a long history with \nMississippi’s Section 303(d) List of Impaired Water Bodies. Beginning in 1996, Patterson Bayou \n(MS345E) and Tippo Bayou (MS346E) were included on the impaired waters list. In 2008, \nHubbard Creek (933711) was added to the states impaired waters list. Since that time, TMDLs \nhave been developed for Patterson Bayou and Tippo Bayou.  Hubbard Creek remains on the \nactive §303(d) list. \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n2 \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed Landuse Map \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n3 \n \nThere are several Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) reports for water bodies within the \nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed (HUC 080302050701).  Both Patterson Bayou and Tippo \nBayou are included in the regional sediment Total Maximum Daily Load Yazoo River Basin \nDelta Region for the Delta Region. The State of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, \nInterstate, and Coastal Waters regulation does not include a numerical water quality standard for \naquatic life protection due to sediment. The narrative standard for the protection of aquatic life is \nsufficient for justification of TMDL development but does not provide a quantifiable TMDL \ntarget. The target for this TMDL is based on reference sediment yields developed by the Channel \nand Watershed Processes Research Unit (CWPRU) at the National Sedimentation Laboratory \n(NSL).  This TMDL calls for an 80-85% reduction in sediment.   \n \nNonpoint loading of sediment in a water body results from the transport of the material into \nreceiving waters by several processes including mass wasting, head cutting, gullying, and sheet \nand rill erosion.  Sources of sediment come from improper agricultural and silvicultural practices \nas well as from a plethora of other improper land-use activities, e.g. construction, mining, \nchannel alterations.  \n \nPatterson Bayou has an additional TMDL for nutrients and dissolved oxygen: Total Maximum \nDaily Load for Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, and Organic Enrichment/Low Dissolved \nOxygen for Patterson Bayou.  Mississippi does not have water quality standards for allowable \nnutrient concentrations. MDEQ currently has a Nutrient Task Force (NTF) working on the \ndevelopment of criteria for nutrients.  The TMDL identified an annual concentration of 0.58 mg/l \nas an applicable target for TN and 0.09 mg/l for TP for water bodies located in the east side of \nthe Delta.  This TMDL calls for Total Phosphorus (TP) to be reduced by 97.16% and Total \nNitrogen (TN) to be reduced by 90.79%. \n \nTippo Bayou also has a TMDL nutrients and dissolved oxygen: Total Maximum Daily Load for \nTotal Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, and Organic Enrichment/Low Dissolved Oxygen for Tippo \nBayou .  The TMDL identified an annual concentration of 0.58 mg/l as an applicable target for \nTN and 0.09 mg/l for TP.  This TMDL calls for Total Phosphorus (TP) to be reduced by 97.3% \nand Total Nitrogen (TN) to be reduced by 91.2%.   \n \nThere are no facilities in the Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed with NPDES permits that \ninclude limits for Total Suspended Solids (TSS) which is used as an indicator of sediment \ncontributions from permitted activities.  Certain contaminants may be associated with sediment \nsuch as pesticides and nutrients. These contaminants were not addressed directly within these \nTMDLs. However, these contaminants would also be controlled by the same best management \npractices (BMPs) that control the sediment from nonpoint sources of pollution.  Non-point \nloading of nutrients and organic material in a water body results from the transport of the \npollutants into receiving waters by overland surface runoff, groundwater infiltration, and \natmospheric deposition. Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus is primarily transported in surface runoff \nwhen it has been sorbed by eroding sediment. \n \nFigure 2 shows all of the impaired segments and segments with TMDLs in the Platner Bayou-\nTippo Bayou Watershed. \n \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n4 \n \n \nFigure 2: Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed Impaired Segments and Monitoring Sites \nElement b: Expected Load Reduction \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n5 \n \n \nThe State of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters \n(MDEQ, 2021) regulation does not include a numerical water quality standard for aquatic life \nprotection due to sediment; however, a narrative standard for the protection of aquatic life was \ninterpreted to determine an applicable target for the sediment TMDL in the Platner Bayou-Tippo \nBayou Watershed.  The narrative standard states waters shall be free from materials attributable \nto municipal, industrial, agricultural, or other dischargers producing color, odor, taste, total \nsuspended solids, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the waters \ninjurious to public health, recreation, or to aquatic life and wildlife, or adversely affect the \npalatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated uses. The sediment \nTMDL which includes both Patterson Bayou (MS345E) and Tippo Bayou (MS346E) concluded \nthat sediment yields would need to be reduced by 80-85% in the watershed.  All sediment yield \nreductions were developed from suspended sediment concentration data measured at stable \nstreams in the same ecoregion(s).  The targets were developed to reflect stable stream conditions \nusing reference sediment yields.  These reference conditions were established by the USDA’s \nChannel and Watershed Processes Research Unit (CWPRU) at the National Sedimentation \nLaboratory (NSL). \n \nNonpoint loading of sediment in a water body results from the transport of material into \nreceiving waters by the processes of mass wasting, head cutting, gullying, and sheet and rill \nerosion.  Sources of sediment include agriculture, silviculture, rangeland, construction sites, \nroads, urban areas, mass wasting areas, gullies, surface mining, in-channel and instream sources, \nand historical landuse activities and channel alterations.   \n \nAt the time of nutrient TMDL development for both Patterson Bayou and Tippo Bayou, MDEQ \ndoes not have numeric nutrient criteria.  To develop the TN and TP targets a percentile approach \nwas used following EPA recommendations.  The Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus TMDL \nfor Patterson Bayou (MS345E) recommended Total Phosphorus (TP) needs to be reduced by \n97.16 % with a target annual concentration of 0.09 mg/L and a reduction of Total Nitrogen (TN) \nto be 90.79% with an annual target concentration of 0.58 mg/L.  The Total Nitrogen, Total \nPhosphorus, and Organic Enrichment/Low DO TMDL for Tippo Bayou (MS346E) calls for a \n97.3% reduction of Total Phosphorus with a target concentration of 0.09 mg/L and a reduction of \nTotal Nitrogen by 91.2% and a target concentration of 0.58 mg/L.  \n \nNon-point loading of nutrients and organic material in a water body results from the transport of \nthe pollutants into receiving waters by overland surface runoff, groundwater infiltration, and \natmospheric deposition. Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus is primarily transported in surface runoff \nwhen it has been sorbed by eroding sediment. \n \nThe NRCS has a list of approved BMPs to address nutrients and sedimentation.  This list will be \nused to identify candidate BMPs in Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou watershed.   \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n6 \n \nElement c: Proposed Management Measures \n \nCoordinating partners with MDEQ include the Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation \nCommission (MSWCC), the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and the local Soil \nand Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) throughout the state.  These SWCDs are typically \nhoused within USDA Service Centers co-located with NRCS offices.  These USDA Service \nCenters handle federal assistance programs offered through the Farm Bill.  As part of these \nservices, SWCD staff communicate regularly with the local landowners and operators within the \nwatershed as they work to support sign-ups for Farm Bill initiatives.   Staff from MSWCC and \nthe SWCD depend upon assistance from their NRCS partners in determining landowner interest \nin the watershed because they are on the farms and in the fields with the landowners, understand \nthe needs at the local level, and have knowledge of the amount of unfunded applications for \nfederal program assistance which meet Section 319 eligibility requirements.  Based on their \nanalysis, installation of the following BMPs would mitigate sediment and nutrient issues in the \nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou watershed helping the stream recover: fencing, watering facilities, \nponds, streambank and shoreline protection, dikes, critical area planting, grade stabilization \nstructures, forage and biomass planting, structures for water control, cover crops or any other \npractices to help reduce sedimentation and nutrient loading.  Factors considered for determining \nspecific locations for the placement of BMPs included the following attributes based upon best \nprofessional judgement of trained NRCS, SWCD, and MDEQ staff: \n \n1. Likely water quality benefits; \n2. Willing landowners; \n3. Implementation of the recommendations of the TMDLs (i.e., “It is recommended that \nwater bodies within [the watershed] be considered a priority for streambank and \nriparian buffer zone restoration and any sediment reduction BMPs, especially for road \ncrossings, agricultural activities, and construction activities); \n4. Ease of showing effectiveness of the BMP(s) through monitoring; and \n5. Shorter length of time for anticipated results (i.e., within the grant period). \n \nElement d: Technical and Financial Assistance \n \nAs part of any Section 319 funded project, MDEQ requires a 40% match in project areas.  This \nmatch may be in the form of actual dollars or may be provided as “in-kind” to project activities.  \nPartners in this project that may contribute match include MSWCC, Tallahatchie County Soil \nand Water Conservation District, NRCS, USGS (monitoring), and/or local landowners and \noperators.  For project implementation, administration, management, and watershed plan \nrevision, as well as hosting and facilitating team meetings, MDEQ plans to work under a \nmemorandum of agreement (MOA) with the MSWCC to implement this project.  Project \npartners provided the funding amounts used to estimate costs for BMP installation.  Provided \nbelow is summary of estimated costs for potential BMPs and overall project implementation: \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n7 \n \nCost Estimate: Full Project Implementation \nBMPs** Size/Amount \nEstimated \nCost \nGrade Stabilization Structure \n85 each @ $8,000 $680,000 \nHeavy Use Area Protection \n10,000 sq.ft. @ $3.93 $39,300 \nTank/Trough \n10 each @ $6,000 $60,000 \nCover Crops \n5,000 ac @ $73 $365,000 \nFencing \n1,040 ft. @ $4.50 $4,680 \nDikes \n136,000 ft. @ $1.90 $258,400 \nPond \n5 @ $6,250 $31,250 \nFencing \n20,000 ft. @ $4.50 $90,000 \nStructure for Water Control \n15 each @ $5,000 $75,000 \nForage and Biomass Planting \n300 ac. @ $211 $63,300 \nStreambank and Shoreline Protection \n2,500 ft. @ $166.87 $417,175 \nTechnical Assistance* N/A $45,000 \nEducation and Outreach* N/A $28,000 \nMonitoring*  N/A $25,760 \nProject Management, Implementation, \nCoordination, Plan Revision* \n  $135,000 \nTotal Estimated Cost \n  \n$2,317,865 \n \n* Denotes fields that are estimated upon three incremental funding cycles of the project  \n** Conservation Best Management Practices provide a 40% match at a minimum. \n \nDue  to  the  magnitude  of  this  project, the  project  will  need  to  be  funded  incrementally  using \nmultiple  funding  sources. In  order  to  fully  address  all  suggested  conservation  needs  in  the \nwatershed, this plan recommends funding be provided in 3 increments.  To maximize education \nand outreach  activities and monitoring efforts, MDEQ plans to leverage  with existing programs \nalready allocated for funding where possible. \n \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n8 \n \nBelow is the estimated budget for the second incremental funding (Phase 1) of this project: \n \nCost Estimate: Phase 1 Implementation \nBMPs* Size/Amount \nEstimated \nCost \nGrade Stabilization Structure \n15 each @ $8,000 $120,000 \nHeavy Use Area Protection \n5,000 sq.ft. @ \n$3.93 $19,650 \nTank/Trough \n6 each @ $6,000 $36,000 \nCover Crops \n700 ac @ $73 $51,100 \nFencing \n1,040 ft. @ $4.50 $4,680 \nStreambank and Shoreline \nProtection \n1,000 ft. @ \n$166.87 $166,870 \nTechnical Assistance N/A $15,000 \nEducation and Outreach N/A $14,000 \nMonitoring  N/A $12,880 \nProject Management, \nImplementation, Coordination, \nPlan Revision \n  $45,000 \nTotal Estimated Phase 1 Cost \n  \n$485,180 \n \n*Conservation Best Management Practices provide a 40% match at a minimum. * \n \nElement e: Information and Education \n \nThe MDEQ, in cooperation with numerous federal, state, and local stakeholders has developed \ndiversified information/education programs, best management practices manuals, literature, \nbooks, videos, and public service announcements that address pollutants from the seven (7) \nmajor landuse categories of Nonpoint Source Pollution: agriculture, construction, forestry, on-\nsite waste water disposal, surface mining, urban storm water runoff, and hydrologic \nmodification.  Audiences from pre-school to adults throughout the state are reached with a \nvariety of mature, well-designed programs each year. These programs, events, manuals and \nliterature can be used in the Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou watershed project by tailoring them to \naddress nonpoint sources of sedimentation and nutrients.  A positive approach is used to reach \nthe full diversity of people in the community with projects that foster a “sense of place”, a “sense \nof pride in community”, and a sense of the native plants, animals, and general ecology of their \nregion, as well as the history of the community and a sense of economics.  Stakeholders and \ncoordinators join together to participate in problem-solving, brainstorming, plan development, \ntraining workshops, festival event planning, soil and water conservation field days, tree boards, \nposter, art and writing projects and other activities that promote collaboration and ownership of \nthe watershed, as well as solutions to its problems.  The ultimate goal is to bring about behavior \nchanges and the use of “best management practices” that will improve water quality and the \noverall quality of life in the watershed.  Evaluation forms, pre-test/ post-test, surveys, and \nreporting of the number of people who attend workshops, trainings and events are among the \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n9 \n \nmethods used to measure the success of education/information programs.  A partial list of \nMDEQ’s programs that could be used in the Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou watershed are listed \nbelow: \n \n• Water Model Presentations - Enviroscapes and groundwater aquifer models distributed \nstatewide with training and related interactive lesson plans. \n• Teacher Workshops – train educators in proximity to the watershed about NPS pollution \nand provide materials and information that can be used in their classrooms. \n• Adopt A Stream - workshops and training venues for citizens, teachers, and students in \nthe Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed. \n•  Watershed Harmony Mobile Classroom - for ages kindergarten – adults with state and \nfederal public education objectives tailored for 4\nth\n and 5\nth\n grade students. \n•  “Train the Trainer” - workshops and materials for Soil and Water districts, Extension \nService, etc. \n• “Waste Pesticide Disposal Event” - The primary goal of this program is to help \nMississippi farmers and property owners minimize the environmental risks associated \nwith the disposal of waste-pesticide products by disposing of products in a safe and \nefficient manner. \n \nAs part of the education outreach efforts, the stakeholder group forming the Platner Bayou-Tippo \nBayou Watershed Implementation Team (WIT) will participate in a minimum of 3 face-to-face \nmeetings.  The purpose of these meetings is to provide updates on implementation activities, \neducation events and review and modify the watershed plan.  In concert with these WIT \nmeetings, and to incentivize stakeholder participation, project funding will be used to purchase \nfood and other refreshments for the WIT along with providing support for renting facilities in \nwhich to host those events.  In accordance with 41 CFR § 301-74.11, light refreshments, meals, \nand/or beverages are an allowable expense under CWA Section 319, provided a description of \nthe agenda, purpose, location, costs, etc., are outlined in an approved 319 grant workplan. The \npurpose of the meetings will be for updating the watershed plan, and hosting field days to \nshowcase the implemented BMPs for the public. At this time the exact number of participants \nand locations are not known therefore costs have been estimated for the purposes of this plan and \nwill be updated. \n \nElement f: Implementation Schedule \n \nSection 319 NPS funding will be used to support implementation of this watershed-based plan \nfor this HUC 12 sub-watershed.  MDEQ, along with support from the Watershed Implementation \nTeam and Project Manager (where applicable), will: \n \n1.

However, a narrative standard for the protection of aquatic life was interpreted to \ndetermine an applicable target for the Yazoo River Basin Delta Region TMDL. The narrative \nstandard states that waters shall be free from materials attributable to municipal, industrial, \nagricultural, or other dischargers producing color, odor, taste, total suspended solids, or other \nconditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the waters injurious to public health, \nrecreation, or to aquatic life and wildlife, or adversely affect the palatability of fish, aesthetic \nquality, or impair the waters for any designated uses.  In lieu of numeric criteria for sediment and \nnutrients, the monitoring will be conducted to collect data on parameters that are considered \nsurrogates for sediment (Total Suspended Solids, Total Suspended Sediment, turbidity) and \nnutrients along with conventional in-situ parameters generally measured to determine aquatic \nhealth (e.g. Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Temperature, Conductivity, Dissolved Solids) will also be \nobtained.  The following thresholds will be used to measure compliance applicable with water \nquality criteria and/or target thresholds:  \n \n \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n12 \n \nParameter Threshold \nDissolved Oxygen Daily Average of 5.0 mg/L; Instantaneous threshold of 4.0 mg/L \nDissolved Oxygen % \nSat ≥ 70% - ≤ 125% \npH 6.0-9.0 \nTemperature Not to exceed 90°F \nSpecific Conductance Less Than 1000 micromhos/cm \nDissolved Solids \nMonthly average less than 750 mg/L; instantaneous threshold less \nthan 1500 mg/L \nChemical Oxygen \nDemand 35 mg/L \nTotal Suspended \nSolids 65 mg/L \nTurbidity 75 NTU \nTotal Nitrogen \n0.58 mg/L annual concentration (numeric threshold established by \nTMDLs for Patterson Bayou and Tippo Bayou) \nTotal Phosphorus \n0.09 mg/L annual concentration (numeric threshold established by \nTMDLs for Patterson Bayou and Tippo Bayou) \n \nIn addition to chemical data, biological community data and in stream habitat surveys will be \ncollected over the course of the project to determine attainment of the Aquatic Life Designated \nUse.  These data are extremely helpful in identifying trends in water quality and should provide \ninformation to help determine if the implementation activities are resulting in water quality \nimprovements.      \n     \nIt should be noted that recovery time of a stream is variable and may extend beyond the \ntimeframe identified in the workplan.  At the end of the project, data will be analyzed to \ndetermine if the data indicate improvements to water quality in the Sherman Creek-Panola \nQuitman Floodway watershed.  In the event data indicate little or no positive change, a Stressor \nAnalysis will be conducted to determine if any new or additional stressors are preventing \nimprovements to water quality.  If any new stressors are identified, the Watershed \nImplementation Team will identify future actions/activities to address those stressors. \n \nElement i: Monitoring \n \nPrior to BMP installation, pre-implementation water quality chemical and biological monitoring \nwill be collected to serve as baseline data for the project along with any historical data available \non Tippo Bayou, Patterson Bayou, and Hubbard Creek. Water quality monitoring will include \nwater chemistry data (nutrients, suspended solids, oxygen demand, chlorides, etc.), in-situ field \nmeasurements for such parameters as dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, specific conductance, \nand turbidity, datalogger (sonde) deployment for continuous in-situ field measurement data as \nwell as biological community monitoring for benthic macroinvertebrates and algal/periphyton \nchlorophyll-a in support of Delta nutrient criteria development. A list of this historical water \n\nPlatner Bayou-Tippo Bayou Watershed GY 2021 \n13 \n \nquality monitoring in the Platner Bayou-Tippo Bayou watershed is provided in the table below \nand their sample locations are shown in Figures 1 and 2. \n \nStation \nID \nWater \nBody \nSample \nYear(s) \nCollecting \nAgency \nProject Water \nChem \nIn-\nSitu \nSonde Benthics \nand/or \nAlgal \nYZ406 Hubbard \nCreek \n2004, \n2014  \nUSGS, \nMDEQ \nDelta \nNutrient, \nDelta \nBluff \nHills \nNutrient \nX X \n \nX \n \nPost-BMP monitoring locations will be selected using best professional judgement and will be \ntargeted to reflect water quality downstream of BMP activity.

Post BMP monitoring will be conducted in a way that allows for comparison \nwith the pre-implementation data.  Because recovery periods of streams can be dependent on \ntype and amount of BMPs installed, more than 1 year of post BMP data may be needed to \nobserve a change in water quality.  In some cases, it may take 5 or more years to see full benefits \nof BMPs. All data collection efforts will be conducted using trained personnel following \nestablished Standard Operating Procedures and adhering to agency Quality Assurance protocols.   \n \n \n ",
