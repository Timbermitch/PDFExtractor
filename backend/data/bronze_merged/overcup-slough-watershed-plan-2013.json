The 20,846 acre Overcup Slough Watershed (HUC # 080302070301) is located \nin Coahoma County, Mississippi, in the Delta physiographic region, and Mississippi Alluvial Plain \nNorthern Holocene Meander Belts ecoregion. Geology in this area consists of mostly unconsolidated \ndeposits of sands, silts, and clays dating back as far as the Pleistocene (Stewart 2003).  The landscape is \ndominated mostly by ridge and swale topography, although portions of the watershed have been \nlandformed to facilitate agricultural irrigation and reduced erosion.  \nThe City of Clarksdale is located near the South Eastern portion of the watershed \n (Figure 2.2). Several smaller communities are scattered throughout the watershed including Sherard,  \nStovall, and Farrell. State Highways 61 and 1 \n\npass through the watershed. Cleveland and Tunica  \nare two larger municipalities within 40 miles of the watershed. \n \n \n \n2.2   Soils \nSoils in the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain physiographic region are primarily young \nsoils (inceptisols) formed on alluvium, and range from mildly acidic to mildly alkaline (Stewart 2003). \nSoils in the watershed are of the Dundee (moderately to somewhat poorly drained fine sandy loam to silty \nclay loam) and Forestdale (somewhat poorly to poorly drained silty clay loam) series. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  1 \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.1 Location of Overcup Slough Watershed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.3   Hydrology \n Overcup Slough (HUC #080302070301) begins in west central Coahoma County, northwest of \nClarksdale. Richies Bayou (headwaters of Overcup Slough) originates around Stovall, MS. Richies Bayou \nmerges with another tributary southeast of Farrell to form Overcup Slough. Overcup then merges with \nanother large tributary in the southern portion of the watershed and turns east eventually emptying into the \nBig Sunflower River. Non-storm flows in Delta streams decrease during the summer months due to low \nrainfall. However, in the Overcup Slough watershed, irrigation water often supplements summer non-\nstorm flows by providing a source of runoff throughout the growing season.  \n \n \n2.4   Land use \nMuch of the original ridge and swale landscape in Overcup Slough watershed has been \ndeveloped; fields have been land formed, and drainage infrastructure has been improved. A map \nof watershed land use is shown in Figure 2.3. While 83% (17,378 acres) of the watershed is \nin production agriculture, no particular crop is dominant. Corn, cotton, soybeans, and rice are all \ncommon. In addition to production agriculture, there are 1,660 acres of wetland, approximately 500 acres \nis fallow and the remainder is urban.  \n \n \n \n \n2.5   Socioeconomics \n \n \n2.5.1 Demographics \n \n Estimated July 2008 population for Coahoma County it was 27,272. The 2008 estimated \npopulation was around 3% less than the population reported in the 2000 census.\n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n(http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/sdc/estimates/2008/CO-EST2008-01-28.htm \n \n \n2-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.5.2 Economy \nThe Delta region of Mississippi where Overcup Slough is located is classified as \neconomically depressed. The estimated 2008 median household income for Coahoma County ($28,320) \nwas below the state median household income ($37,818), and were in the lowest 11% of the state.2  \nThe economy in the Overcup Slough watershed is dominated by agribusiness.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.2.

NPDES Point sources \n There are two permitted wastewater discharges in the watershed (enSearch, accessed). The \nPublicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) for the community of Farrell (MS0045187) and, Mascot \nPlanting Company, which is permitted to discharge domestic wastewater (MS0022225). \n \n \n \n2.6.1.1.2. NPDES Storm water \nThe Overcup Slough watershed is not subject to MS4 storm water permitting under the \nClean Water Act. Under state law, storm water permits are required for construction in the \nwatershed. \n2.6.1.1.3. Section 303(d) and TMDLs \nWater bodies in the Overcup Slough watershed were included on the Mississippi 2006 \nSection 303(d) List of Impaired Water Bodies (MDEQ 2007a). Overcup Slough, and Richies Bayou \nwere listed due to evaluated causes of sediment, organic enrichment/low dissolved oxygen, and nutrients \n(Figure 2.4). The Clean Water Act requires that total maximum daily load (TMDL) studies be completed \nfor all water bodies included on the 303(d) list. Table 2.1 summarizes the TMDLs addressing Overcup \nSlough water quality impairments that have been completed as of 2008 . Because these TMDLs have \nbeen completed, these water bodies do not appear on the  2010 303(d) list (MDEQ 2010). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  5 \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.3.

Navigable Waters \nSeveral sections of the Clean Water Act deal with controlling impacts to navigable \nwaters. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act controls the placement of dredge or fill materials into \nwetlands and other waters of the US. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires MDEQ to \ncertify that a project requiring a Section 10 (see 2.6.1.2) or Section 404 permit will not violate \nthe state water quality standards. These sections of the Clean Water Act require that impacts to \nqualifying waterbodies be avoided or minimized. Where impacts are unavoidable, mitigation \nmay be required. Qualifying waterbodies include wetlands and “Other Waters of the US”. The \nbasic definition for Other Waters of the US, for the purpose of Section 404, is any waterbody \nthat displays an ordinary high water mark (OHWM). This includes lakes and ponds that have a \nhydrological connection to a qualifying waterbody, and perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral \nstream channels which exhibit an OHWM. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nadministers the regulations associated with both of these sections. \nThe USACE commonly issues two types of permits under Section 404; Individual \nPermits and Nationwide Permits (NWPs). Individual Permits are required when 1) impacts to \nwetlands exceed 0.5 acre, and/or 2) greater than 300 linear feet of a qualifying waterbody is to be \nimpacted. This Individual Permit includes a period of public review, and processing generally \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  7\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntakes between 60 and 120 days. The processing time can be greater if public hearings or \nenvironmental statements are required, or if all required information on the permit application \nform is not provided. NWPs are general permits typically used when minor impacts are \nnecessary to wetlands (less than 0.5 acre) or a qualifying waterbody (any impacts less than \n300 linear feet). Processing time is generally less and no public review period is necessary. \nMitigation for both wetland losses or stream function and value losses may be required \nby the USACE for a project authorized under either an individual or nationwide permit. The \nextent of the mitigation is dependent upon the size, quality, and functionality of the wetland or \nwaterbody to be impacted. \n \n \n2.6.1.2 Rivers and Harbors Act \nSection 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act regulates activities that have the potential to \nobstruct navigation in waters of the US, including wetlands. \n \n \n2.6.1.3 Farm Bill \nUnder the Federal Food Security Act (Farm Bill), initially passed in 1985, all US farm \noperators are required to meet soil erosion control standards specified in the law. Compliance \nwith these standards is a prerequisite for participation in most federal farm programs. Subsequent \namendments to the Farm Bill have added programs that provide incentives to farm operators for \nenhancing water quality through such actions as taking highly erodible lands out of production, \nand restoring wetlands. One such program is the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds \nInitiative (MRBI). The MRBI is being implemented through NRCS programs funded by the \nFarm Bill, including the Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative, Wetlands Reserve \nEnhancement Program, and Conservation Innovation Grants. The Overcup Slough watershed is a \ntarget sub-watershed of the Sunflower River watershed for the MRBI. \n \n \n \n2.6.1.4 National Flood Insurance Program \nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a non-regulatory federal program, \nwhich is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, this \nprogram provides mechanisms that can be used to restrict development in floodplains, which can \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  8 \n \n \n \n\nUtility Water Source Population Served \nWater Quality \nViolations \nFarrell Utilities groundwater 246 coliform 2000, 2007 \nSherard Water \nAssociation \ngroundwater 147 \nTTHM: Oct 2007 \nthrough Mar 2009 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave beneficial effects on water quality. The NFIP supports development and enforcement of \nfloodplain management plans and ordinances. All of the unincorporated areas of Coahoma Counties \nparticipate in the NFIP, as well as the City of Clarksdale.\n3\n \n \n \n2.6.1.5 Safe Drinking Water Act \nAll drinking water systems serving 25 people or more are considered public drinking \nwater systems and are subject to EPA regulation through the Safe Drinking Water Act. Elements \nof the Safe Drinking Water Act include the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, \nDisinfection Byproducts Rule, and the requirement for Source Water Assessment and Protection. \nIn Mississippi, the Safe Drinking Water Act is administered by the Mississippi State Department \nof Health. The lists of public water utilities provided on the Mississippi State Department of \nHealth website indicate that there are four public water utilities serving the residents of the \nOvercup Slough watershed.\n4\n Information about these utilities and their compliance with Safe \nDrinking Water standards are summarized in Table 2.2 \n \n \n \nTable 2.2.  Public Drinking Water Utilities in Overcup Slough Watershed from \nthe EPA Safe Drinking Water Information System5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.6.2 State Regulations \n \n2.6.2.1 Water quality standards \nThe water use classifications are established by the State of Mississippi in the document \nState of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters \n(MDEQ, 2007b). The designated beneficial use for the listed segments is Fish and Wildlife \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n http://www.msema.org/insurance/floodplain.html, accessed  \n4\n http://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/30,0,76,256.html, accessed  \n \n \n \n2-  9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(MDEQ 2008a,b,c) The water quality standard applicable to the use of the water body and the \npollutant of concern is defined in the State of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, \nInterstate, and Coastal Waters (MDEQ, 2007b). Mississippi’s current standards contain a narrative \ncriteria that can be applied to nutrients which states “Waters shall be free from materials attributable \nto municipal, industrial, agricultural, or other discharges producing color, odor, taste, total \nsuspended or dissolved solids, sediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a \nnuisance, render the waters injurious to public health, recreation, or to aquatic life and wildlife, or \nadversely affect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated use \n(MDEQ, 2007b).” \nThe standard for dissolved oxygen states, “DO concentrations shall be maintained at a \ndaily average of not less than 5.0 mg/l with an instantaneous minimum of not less than 4.0 mg/l.” In \naddition, thUo ii92e State water quality standard regulations include a natural condition clause which will \nbe used to determine the appropriate DO for Overcup Slough under critical conditions. Natural conditions \nare defined as background water quality conditions due only to non-anthropogenic sources. The \ncriteria herein apply specifically with regard to substances attributed to sources (discharges, nonpoint \nsources, or instream activities) as opposed to natural phenomena. Waters may naturally have \ncharacteristics outside the limits established by these criteria. Therefore, naturally occurring \nconditions that fail to meet criteria should not be interpreted as violations of these criteria. \nSince no water quality data have been collected in this watershed, no violations of state water \nquality criteria have been documented. However, MDEQ has judged that conditions in the watershed \nare likely to result in violations of these water quality criteria. \n \n \n2.6.2.2 Highway Construction Runoff \nThe Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) is responsible for implementation \nof erosion and sediment control practices on highway construction. MDOT is required to apply to \nMDEQ for a Certificate of Permit Coverage for construction projects to be permitted through the \nstate construction storm water general permit. As of August 21, 2013, there are no active water \npermits for highway construction in the Overcup Slough watershed (MDEQ enSearch). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.6.2.3 On-site wastewater treatment regulations \nState regulations addressing on-site wastewater treatment systems are administered \nthrough the Mississippi State Department of Health. Regulations are in place to address \nsingle-family residence on-site wastewater treatment systems, as well as on-site systems serving \nrecreational vehicle campgrounds, developments, and multi-family dwellings. These regulations \nrequire approval and certification of all new installations of on-site wastewater treatment \nsystems, including replacement of old systems. Certification is not required for systems in use \nprior to enactment of the regulations, providing they meet criteria specified in the regulations.\n6\n \n \n \n \n2.6.2.4 Fish consumption advisories \nFish tissue sampling is conducted by MDEQ for the purpose of identifying potential \nhuman health threats. These data are used by a multi-agency task force to evaluate the need for \nfish consumption advisories in Mississippi. Overcup Slough is included in the Delta-wide \nconsumption advisory for toxaphene and DDT. This advisory recommends that people limit \nconsumption of carp, buffalo, gar, and catfish larger than 22 inches to no more than one meal \nevery two weeks (MSDH 2001). \n \n \n \n2.6.2.5 Water Withdrawals \nMississippi law, all wells drilled with a casing diameter of 6 inches or greater are \nrequired to have a water use permit. In addition, water use permits are required for surface water \nwithdrawals, and construction of water storage impoundments. Permits are good for 10 years. \nThe Yazoo Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District (YMD) is responsible for \nprocessing water use permits in the Delta, including the Overcup Slough watershed. Water use \npermits are issued by the MDEQ State Permit Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n http://www.msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/30,0,78.html, accessed  \n \n \n \n \n2-  11\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.7   Existing management \nProducers in this watershed have a history of recognizing environmental concerns and \nvoluntarily addressing them through assistance programs such as EQIP and CRP. Sediment \nconcerns have been addressed by ongoing efforts. Low flows in water bodies such as the upper \nSunflower River have prompted actions such as well fields and weirs. \nOvercup Slough is primarily used for agricultural drainage and as a source for irrigation \nwater. The NRCS sponsored some watershed protection and flood prevention work in the watershed \naround 2003 (CFR 68(10):2007) and Environmental Quality Incentives Program [EQIP] (7 CFR Part \n1466).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  12\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.0 RESOURCES AND CONDITION \n \n \n \n3.1   Water quality \nUSGS and MSU began water quality sampling in 2010 within the watershed. MSU began \nsampling at edge of field and near field locations in order to monitor water leaving agricultural fields. \nUSGS began sampling in tributaries farther downstream. These monitoring efforts have led to a greater \nunderstanding of water quality within the watershed and leaving crop fields. As noted in Section 2.6.1.1.3, \nwater bodies in this watershed have been identified by MDEQ as not having water quality adequate to \nsupport its designated uses. However, these determinations were based on evaluated assessments, not on \nwater quality data. \n \n \n \n3.2   Water quantity \n Water supply is a growing concern in the region. Ground water depletion in the Mississippi \nAlluvial Plain has resulted in lower flows in many streams, including the Sunflower River (MS Museum \nof Natural Science 2005). Groundwater is withdrawn for drinking and irrigating crops. \n \n \n \n3.3   Wildlife and Habitat \nThe  U.S .   Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  has  identified  three  endangered  species  that  may  occur  in  \nCoahoma  County.  These  include  the  Pallid  Sturgeon  (Found  In Mississippi  River),  Least  Tern  (Shore  \nBird), and Fat Pocket Book Mussel. Habitats that are identified as important for the species of concern \nand  that  occur  in  or  in  close  proximity  to  the  Overcup  Slough  watershed  include,  oxbow  lakes,  \nbottomland  hardwood  forests,  artificial  ponds,  ephemeral  ponds,  and  streams.  Overall,  streams  in  the  \nDelta are classified  as critically imperiled because of the widespread degradation of stream habitats in \nthis region. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3-  1\n\nPercentile \nSmall \nNon\n\n-flowing \nSmall \nFlowing \nSmall Flowing + Non-Flowing \n25 11 13 13 \n50 14 15 15 \n75 17 17 17 \nHarris Bayou Mouth 14 -- -- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.4   Evaluation of Overcup Slough Fish Community \nThis evaluation of the Harris Bayou (HUC 10) watershed that encompasses the Overcup Slough \nwatershed fish community is based on sampling performed by EDRC (Engineering Development and \nResearch Center, US Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg, MS). Sampling was performed as part of \nstream community monitoring conducted by ERDC to assess the condition of fish communities in MS \nDelta streams. The sampling data provided the basis for the development of an index of biotic integrity \nsensu Karr (1981). The index uses metrics that capture the variety of feeding types (e.g. insectivores, \npredators), habitat selection (e.g. preferring current vs. pools) and taxonomy (e.g. sunfish and minnows) \npresent in a sample of fish. Sampling was conducted with seines according to a standardized protocol. \nEach sampling site was assigned an IBI score based on the values of the population metrics. Streams \nwere categorized as large unregulated or small, and flowing or non-flowing. Higher IBI scores \nindicate a more diverse fish community. \nHarris Bayou was placed in the small non-flowing category. Fish sampling was \nconducted at a single location on June 6, 2006 and showed an IBI value of 14. This value is \ncompared with other streams in both the flowing and non-flowing categories in Table 3.1. The \nresults show that, at the time of sampling, the quality of the fish community could be described \nas “intermediate” among similar streams. The applicability of these results, which were obtained \nin 2006, would depend on whether significant changes in habitat and water quality have occurred \nbetween 2006 and the present. \n \n \nTable 3.1.

Low water levels, flows, and dissolved oxygen during late summer months limit \nthe existence of desirable fish species. Also, public access to Overcup Slough is very limited.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.0 STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS/ISSUES \n \n \nProducers living or farming in the Overcup Slough watershed identified watershed issues \n they would like addressed through a Watershed Implementation Plan. These included sediment, \nnutrients, pesticides, declining water table and stream flows, water management, loss of coastal \nmarsh, and financing. This plan will also address the water quality impairments identified in the \n2006 303(d) list for which TMDLs have been completed. These issues, and their causes and \nsources are discussed in greater detail below. \n \n \n \n4.1   Water Management \n  \n Water management issues include both flooding and drought. The stakeholders identified \nflooding as an issue in the Overcup Slough watershed, as well as the need for improved water use \nefficiency and storage capacity. \n \n \n \n4.1.1 Locations Where Water Management is an Issue \nStakeholders were concerned that irrigation water be managed better so that less is lost \ndownstream. Flooding was also raised as an issue, however, no specific locations were identified \nas particularly problematic. Given the flat topography and presence of poorly drained soils, it is \nlikely this is an issue throughout the watershed. \n \n \n \n4.1.2 Causes \nDuring storms, water backs up and causes flooding. During the growing season, rainfall \nand surface water are not adequate to support crops. \n \n \n \n4.1.3 Sources \nTerrain in the watershed is relatively flat, making it less likely to drain well during \nstorms. In addition, stakeholders have identified sedimentation as contributing to flooding by \nreducing the conveyance capacity of ditches and streams. Regional climate determines the \nnatural availability of water during the growing season. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.2   Water Level Declines \nGroundwater levels in the Overcup Slough watershed have declined to the point that \nproducers have to drill deeper wells to access the water. Regional estimates of groundwater level \nchange in the Delta indicate that between 1998 and 2008 the average groundwater level decline \nin the area of the Overcup Slough watershed ranged from zero to 0.9 foot per year (YMD 2008). \nStakeholders are also concerned about decreased water levels in the Sunflower River, used as a \nsource of irrigation water and recreation. \n \n \n \n4.2.1 Locations Where Water Level Declines are an Issue \nGroundwater levels are declining throughout the watershed (YMD 2008). Recharge of \nthe shallow aquifer occurs from the Sunflower River, other streams, lakes and impoundments \nthat incise the confining layer overlaying the aquifer (Renken 1998). The majority of recharge is \nfrom infiltration of rainfall, despite the fact that soils in the Delta tend to be poorly drained \n(Arthur 2001). \nDeclining water levels in the Sunflower River are also a concern of Overcup Slough \nstakeholders. \n \n \n \n4.2.2 Cause \nWater is being withdrawn from the aquifer faster than it is being recharged. Base flows in \nmost Delta streams naturally decrease during the summer months due to less rainfall. The decline \nin the Sunflower River water levels has occurred because the groundwater levels have declined \nbelow the level of the Sunflower River (Renken 1998). \n \n \n \n4.2.3 Sources \nIrrigation accounts for the majority of the ground and surface water withdrawals in the \nOvercup Slough watershed. As noted in Section 3.2, groundwater is also used to supply drinking \nwater in the watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.3   Sediment \nStakeholders noted that sedimentation in ditches and streams contributes to flooding. \nThey also expressed concern that the presence of Herbicide-resistant weeds in the watershed may \nresult in increased cultivation (i.e., decreased no-till practice), which could increase erosion and \nsediment loads. MDEQ has determined that there is a high probability that sediment loads in Richies \nBayou and Overcup Slough are at levels that interfere with fish and other wildlife.  High sediment loads \ncan affect aquatic life by causing reduced visibility (when the sediment is suspended in the water column) \nor by changing stream habitat when the sediment is deposited (e.g., covering spawning areas). The \nsediment TMDLs for these water bodies recommend that sediment loads to these water bodies be reduced, \nalthough the recommended reduction is not explicitly specified. \n \n \n \n4.3.1 Locations Where Sediment is an Issue \n \nStakeholders identified drainage ditches and streams as places where sedimentation is an \nissue. MDEQ identified Richies Bayou (near Sherard from headwaters to confluence with Overcup \nSlough) and Harris Bayou (near Beverly from headwaters at Richies Bayou to the Big Sunflower River  as \nareas where sediment was expected to be a water quality issue. \n \n \n \n4.3.2 Cause \nSediment is the pollutant causing sedimentation and turbidity issues in these water \nbodies. Sediment is created by erosion of soil particles from land surfaces in the watershed and \ndetachment of soil from the banks and beds of water bodies. Soils in the watershed tend to be \nfine grained, which could make them more susceptible to erosion. \n \n \n \n4.3.3 Sources \nOn the Mississippi 2006 303(d) list, nonpoint sources are listed as the sources of \nsediment causing the impairments in the listed water bodies in the Overcup Slough watershed. In \nthe sediment TMDL that addresses these impairments, a number of likely sediment sources were \nidentified (MDEQ 2008d). These included agriculture, construction sites, roads, urban areas, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmass wasting, gullies, channel instability, channel modification, and historical land use activities. \nLocations of gullies and other erosion “hot spots” in the Overcup Slough watershed will be \nidentified as part of the implementation of management activities described in this plan. The \nmajority of sediment loading to streams occurs during rain storms as a result of runoff and high \nvelocity flows (Meade et al. 1990). \n \n \n \n4.4   Nutrient Enrichment \nStakeholders identified nutrients in runoff as an issue of concern. Stakeholders also \nexpressed concern about the costs associated with variable-rate fertilizer applications (i.e., precision \nagriculture). MDEQ has determined that there is a high probability that nutrient c oncentrations in \nRichies Bayou and Overcup Slough are at levels that can create conditions harmful to fish and other \nwildlife. High nutrient concentrations can support unusually high growth of algae or other aquatic \nplants. When the algae die, their decomposition uses oxygen from the water, which can result in low \noxygen levels that are harmful to fish and other aquatic life. The TMDLs for these water bodies \nrecommend reductions of total phosphorus loads by about 95%, and reductions of total nitrogen loads \nby about 85% (see Table 2.1). \n \n \n \n4.4.1 Locations Where Nutrient Enrichment is an Issue \nStakeholders did not identify specific locations where nutrients are a water quality issue. \nThe following stream reaches were identified in the 2006 303(d) list as having impaired water \nquality due to nutrient enrichment: \n \n \n• Richies Bayou from the headwaters near Sherard, MS to the confluence with Overcup Slough; \n• Overcup Slough from the headwaters at Richies Bayou near Beverly, MS to the confluence with \nthe Sunflower River. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.4.2 Cause \nNitrogen and phosphorus are the pollutants that are suspected of causing eutrophic \nconditions in these water bodies with high productivity and low dissolved oxygen levels. Total \nnitrogen and total phosphorus are the species of these nutrients that were addressed in the \nTMDLs (MDEQ 2008a,b,c). \n \n \n \n4.4.3 Sources \nNutrient loads are contributed by point sources and nonpoint sources in the watershed. \n \n \n \n4.4.3.1 Point Sources \nTwo NPDES permitted point sources discharge to Overcup Slough or its tributaries. They \nare Farrell POTW (MS0045187), and Mascot Planting Company (MS0022225) (enSearch accessed ). \nBoth permits are for the discharge of treated domestic wastewater (i.e., treated sewage).  The NPDES \npermit for the Farrell POTW includes limits for ammonia thatwill go into effect in 2012. The NPDES \npermit for the Mascot Planting Company does not include limits for nutrients. Treated domestic \nwastewater often contains phosphorus and other nitrogen species (e.g., nitrate) (EPA 2009). \n \n \n \n4.4.3.2 Nonpoint Sources \nTotal nitrogen is a combination of the many forms of nitrogen found in the environment. \nInorganic nitrogen can be transported in particulate and dissolved phases in surface runoff. Dissolved \ninorganic nitrogen can enter groundwater through infiltration, and may enter a water body through \ngroundwater seepage or discharge. Finally, atmospheric gaseous nitrogen may enter a water body \nthrough diffusion, and dissolved and particulate nitrogen species can enter through atmospheric \ndeposition. \nPhosphorus is primarily transported in surface runoff when it has been sorbed to eroding \nsediment. Phosphorus may also be associated with fine-grained particulate matter in the atmosphere \nand can enter streams as a result of dry fallout and rainfall (EPA 1999). Phosphorus may also be \ncontained in the surface runoff due to fertilizers and animal excrement or watersheds with naturally \noccurring soils that are rich in phosphorus (Thomann and Mueller, 1987). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatersheds with a large number of failing septic tanks may also deliver significant loadings of \nphosphorus to a waterbody. Phosphorus levels are also high in groundwater in the Delta, so \nphosphorus in surface waters can also come from groundwater seepage or discharge. USGS has \nan ongoing sampling program to quantify the cause of phosphorus in groundwater. \nOn the Mississippi 2006 303(d) list, nonpoint sources are listed as the sources of nutrients \ncausing the impairments in Richies Bayou and Overcup Slough. In both nutrient TMDLs, cropland \nwas assumed to contribute the majority of the nutrient load to the water bodies (MDEQ 2008a,b,c). \nAs noted in Section 2.5, there are approximately 17,877 acres of cropland in the Overcup Slough \nwatershed. \n \n \n4.5   Organic Enrichment and Low DO \nThe presence of high levels of organic material in water bodies can reduce water oxygen \nlevels such that aquatic life cannot be supported. The TMDLs addressing these impairments state \nthat reducing nutrient loads is expected to reduce organic enrichment and low dissolved oxygen \nconditions (MDEQ 2008a,b,c). Therefore, no reduction is specified in the TMDLs for organic \nmaterial (TBODu). \n \n \n \n4.5.1 Locations Where Organic Enrichment and Low DO are Issues \nThe following stream reaches were identified in the 2006 303(d) list as impaired due to \norganic enrichment and low dissolved oxygen: \n \n \n• Richies Bayou from the headwaters near Sherard, MS to the confluence with \nOvercup Slough; \n• Overcup Slough from the headwaters at Richies Bayou near Beverly, MS to the \nconfluence with the Sunflower River. \n \n \n \n4.5.2 Cause \nThe TMDLs assumed that nutrient enrichment was the cause of the organic enrichment \nand low dissolved oxygen conditions (MDEQ 2008a,b,c). As described in Section 4.2, high \nnutrient concentrations in a water body can encourage the growth of aquatic plants, which \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  6\n\nDischarge Phase \nBODs Limits DO Limits \nAvg Max Min \nFarrell POTW \nI 45 mg/L 65 mg/L Report \nII 6 mg/L 9 mg/L 6 mg/L \nMascot Planting \nCompany \nNA 30 mg/L 40 mg/L NA \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbecomes organic material when it dies, and removes oxygen from the water as it decomposes. \nHigh levels of organic material decomposing in a water body deplete oxygen from the water and \nsuffocate aquatic life. \n \n \n \n4.5.3 Sources \nWhile nutrient enrichment is believed to be the primary cause of organic enrichment and \nlow dissolved oxygen conditions cited for the listed water bodies, there are potential sources of \norganic matter in the watershed that may also contribute to these conditions. They are discussed \nbelow. See Section 4.4.3 for a discussion of nutrient sources in the Overcup Slough watershed. \n \n \n \n4.5.3.1 Point Sources \nTwo NPDES permitted point sources discharge to Overcup Slough or its tributaries. They \nare Farrell POTW (MS0045187), and Mascot Planting Company (MS0022225) (enSearch accessed ). \nBoth permits are for the discharge of treated domestic wastewater (i.e.,treated sewage).  The NPDES \npermit for the Farrell POTW includes limits for oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen. The NPDES \npermit for the Mascot Planting Company also includes limits for oxygen demand (Table 4.1). While these \ntypes of discharges can deplete oxygen downstream of the discharge point, the effect is usually fairly \nlocalized. \n \n \nTable 4.1.   NPDES Permit Limits for Point Sources of Organic Enrichment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.5.3.2 Nonpoint Sources \nOrganic material, such as crop residue, leaves, and chaff, can be washed into the water \nbody from the surrounding land, and exert an oxygen demand as they decompose. Sources can \nalso include plants along the stream banks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.6   Pesticides \nStakeholders identified the potential for runoff to carry pesticides to ditches and streams \nas a concern. They also expressed concern that the presence of Herbicide-resistant weeds in the \nwatershed may lead to increased herbicide application. A fish consumption advisory is in effect \nfor long-lived pesticides in selected fish species that covers all Delta streams and lakes, including \nthose in the Overcup Slough watershed (see Section 2.6.2.4). Pesticide concentrations in soils, \nsurface water and groundwater have not been identified as a health concern. \n \n \n \n4.6.1 Locations Where Pesticides are an Issue \nLegacy pesticides in fish are an issue for all Delta water bodies, including Overcup Slough, \nits tributaries, and all other water bodies in the watershed. Stakeholders are concerned about the \neffects of current-use pesticides on wildlife that live in and use local ditches and streams. Herbicide-\nresistant weeds can occur in fields and lands around fields, including ditches. \n \n \n \n4.6.2 Causes \nDDT and Toxaphene are the pesticides named in the Delta-wide fish consumption \nadvisory. These pesticides degrade very slowly in the environment and are bioaccumulative, \nmeaning they accumulate in living tissue and can be passed on to other organisms, including \nhumans, through the food chain. Eventually, these pesticides can accumulate in certain fish \nspecies to the point that eating those fish can cause health problems in people. DDT and \nToxaphene have been measured in fish tissue throughout the Delta at levels that may harm \nhuman health. \n \n \n \n4.6.3 Sources \nStakeholders expressed concern about the potential for field applications of herbicides to \ncontribute pesticides to surface waters. As weeds become resistant to commonly-used herbicides, \napplication rates and frequency of herbicide applications can increase, which increases the potential for \nherbicides to enter surface waters. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDDT and Toxaphene are no longer used in the US. The use of DDT was banned in the \nUS in 1973, and use of Toxaphene was banned in 1982. Historically, however, DDT and \nToxaphene were commonly used on croplands in the Delta, including the 17,877 acres of \ncropland in the Overcup Slough watershed. Because it takes decades for these chemicals to deg\n\nrade, \nthey are still found in soils, sediments, and living organisms in the Delta. Recent measurements \nof concentrations of DDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue collected from the Delta indicate that \nconcentrations of these pesticides are decreasing (MDEQ 2001). This suggests that the residual \nDDT and Toxaphene is finally degrading. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  9\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5.0 RESTORATION AND PROTECTION GOALS \n \n \n \n5.1   Water Quality  \n \nThe restoration and protection goals for the Overcup Slough watershed are based, in part, on \nthe goal of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy; which is answering the following questions: \n \n1.     What percent reduction of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loading is possible? \n2.     What do the sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus load reductions cost? \n3.     What are the benefits of these load reductions for stakeholders? \n4.      What nutrient load reductions will protect Delta water quality and the Gulf of Mexico? \n \n \n5.2   Water Quantity \n \n  The restoration and protection goals for the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed are also based partly \non  the goals of the Mississippi Delta  Sustainable Water Resources Imitative, some of which \ninclude the following questions:  \n \n1.     How much groundwater recharge is possible in the watershed? \n2.      How much groundwater savings can be achieved with voluntary conservation measures? \n3.      How much groundwater savings can be achieved through the development and use of surface \n water resources in the watershed? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6.0 TARGETING AND PRIORITIZATION \n \n \n \nBMPs are being planned for implementation in the Overcup Slough watershed through several \n projects. The prioritization and targeting approaches used for these projects are described below. \n \n \n \n6.1   Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy \nNutrient loading in agricultural runoff varies by region, watershed, and individual field. \nThe nutrient cycle in an agricultural watershed is extremely complex with many inputs and \nvariables. To fully address the issue, a comprehensive approach must be used to ensure that all \nfactors are considered. As part of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy, the Site \nCharacterization Work Group was tasked with developing a strategy to prioritize agricultural \nsystems for nutrient reduction. \nUsing this strategy, systems within the Overcup Slough watershed were classified based on \nsoil type, cropping practices, and existing drainage infrastructure. Soils were classified as heavy \n(clays), medium (l oams) light (sandy loams), and mixed (clay, loam, and sandy loams found in \nclose proximity due to ridge and swale topography). Cropping practices were initially classified \nas irrigated or dry land, and then by crop type - soybeans, rice/soybean rotation, c  otton, or \ncorn. Drainage infrastructure was classified as developed or undeveloped. Developed land \ntypically consists of leveled or precision graded fields with pipes, pads, and tailwater ditches, or \nridge and swale land that has been shaped to facilitate furrow irrigation. Undeveloped land \nincludes areas with significant ridge and swale and/or that are subject to frequent flooding. These \nareas are not developed because the development cost exceeds potential benefits. \n Project sites within the Overcup Slough watershed will be selected for implementation of \nnutrient reduction BMP's (figure 6.1) These proposed sites are characteristic of systems that are \nrepresentative of the agricultural landscape throughout the Overcup Slough watershed. . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     6-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6.2   Mississippi River Basin Initiative - Cooperative Conservation Partnership \nInitiative \nCatchments with active or planned water quality monitoring will be given priority to \nreceive funds under the Mississippi River Basin Initiative – Cooperative Conservation \nPartnership Initiative (MRBI-CCPI) program. Producers must submit applications for funding to \nthe Coahoma C ounty NRCS office. \n \n \n \n6.3   Mississippi River Basin Initiative- Wetland Reserve Enhanced Program \nAreas within the Overcup Slough watershed will be prioritized for wetland restoration based \non gaps in waterfowl and wildlife habitat, existence of Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) contracts and  \nproducer willingness to participate in WRP. Ranking criteria for high priority restoration and \nenhancement projects, developed by DW and MDWFP, include factors such as location, riparian \nbuffers, water availability, proximity to other waterfowl habitat, and connectivity with surrounding \nhabitat. The Forest Breeding-Bird Decision Support Model results will also be considered as part of the \nprioritization process. In consultation with local NRCS staff, these ranking criteria will be used to help \nprioritize sites for WRP contracts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6-  2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        Figure 6.1 Overcup Slough Potential BMP Opportunities \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6-  3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6.4    Harris Bayou Drainage District Projects \nThe Harris Bayou Drainage District (HBDD) conducts annual maintenance primarily in the \nwaterway and floodway of Overcup Slough. Sediment and trash accumulation are the primary problems \nwithin the drainage district ditches. These problems lead to poor drainage and flooding in portions of the \nwatershed. HBDD has ongoing projects to address these concerns but lack the financial means to \ncontinually address trouble spots.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n        \n      \n6-  4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.0 MANAGEMENT \n \n \nThere are two underlying management principles of this WIP: ecosystem-based \nmanagement and adaptive management. The goals and objectives of this plan reflect these \nprinciples. Each of these management principles is briefly described below, followed by \nwatershed management actions that are planned for the near future to work toward the vision for \nOvercup Slough. Goals related to other existing or potential concerns in this watershed will be \naddressed in future implementation plans. \n \n \n \n7.1   Ecosystem-Based Management \nAn ecosystem-based approach is being used for watershed management in the Overcup   \nSlough watershed. Overcup Slough and its watershed represent the ecosystem management unit. \nAlthough bayous and lakes are typically considered the ecosystem, water bodies and their \nwatershed are inexorably coupled. Land use and land cover activities in the watershed directly or \nindirectly affect the water body. Sediment and nutrient loadings from the watershed drive many \naquatic ecosystem processes, including both desirable and undesirable changes in the water \nbody. The ecosystem, however, is characterized not only by its environmental attributes, but also \nby its socioeconomic attributes. Humans are part of, not apart from, aquatic ecosystems. \nWatershed management is fundamentally a social activity (Thornton and Creager 2001). \nThe benefits that accrue from reduced sediment and nutrient loadings to water bodies in \nthe Overcup Slough watershed are not just in terms of increased water clarity, reduced \nsedimentation, increased water quantity, reduced flooding, reduced algal blooms, a more \nproductive sport fishery, and greater recreational and aesthetic values. The agricultural \ncommunity also benefits from reduced sediment and nutrient loadings. For example, Pimentel et al. \n(1995) estimated that each ton of soil lost to erosion was worth about $6.75 per year to the \nfarmer ($5.00 per ton for lost nutrients, and $1.75 per ton for lost soil and water capacity). The \nDelta sediment TMDL estimates that at least 0.007 tons per acre per day of sediment is lost from \nDelta watersheds. Based on this loss rate, just over approximately 44,000 tons of soil are lost \nfrom the Overcup Slough watershed each year (17,378 acres x 0.007 x 365), and the minimum \nestimate of dollars lost from the watershed is about $297,000 per year (44,000 x $6.75). \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese estimates are very conservative because they are based on yield from the watershed, not loss from \nthe fields (field losses are higher than delivery to the waterbody). \n \n \n \n7.2   Adaptive Management Process \nIn addition to ecosystem-based management, an adaptive management process is being \nused for watershed management in the Overcup Slough watershed. Adaptive management is \n“learning by doing” and has become the recommended approach for ecosystem and natural \nresources management, including watershed management (Christensen et al. 1996; Holling 1978; \nJackson et al. 2001). Adaptive management has helped shift management from the concept that \nthere is a “balance of nature” to a more realistic concept that ecosystems are dynamic, non- \nequilibrium systems. The environment is continually changing – climate, development, \nagricultural practices, demographics, and societal values. Adaptive management is the only \nfeasible approach for moving toward sustainable water resources (Coleman 1998). \nAdaptive management, or learning by doing, means that periodic assessments must be \nmade to determine if results-based criteria are being attained and if the water bodies and \nwatershed are moving toward the desired vision for Overcup Slough and its watershed. The \nschedule for these periodic assessments and revision of the watershed management plan is \ndiscussed in Chapters 9 and 10. The rotating basin approach used by MDEQ is part of this \nperiodic assessment process. \n \n \n7.3   Planned activities \nThere are two key factors in this watershed that dictate which BMPs will be successful, \nirrigation and development. With development comes an increased financial investment by the \nlandowner. As land cost increases, landowner willingness to take land out of production to \nimplement BMPs decreases. This scenario calls for larger BMPs to be implemented in \nundeveloped areas that will treat runoff from upstream, developed areas. The less developed \nareas of the watershed are characterized by ridge and swale topography and there are more \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nopportunities for BMP implementation. Low-lying swales are suitable for treatment wetlands, \nwhile unimproved drainage ditches are prime candidates for low grade weirs, tail water recovery \nsystems, and other BMPs. \nIrrigation, particularly of rice, introduces an additional factor into the nutrient equation. \nNon-storm flows in most Delta streams naturally decrease during the summer months due to less \nrainfall. Irrigation water supplements these non-storm flows and often provides a constant source \nof runoff throughout the growing season. Although increased non-storm flows benefit many \naspects of stream health and water quality, it also reduces the ability of some BMPs to trap \nnutrients. For example, multiple low grade weirs are designed to trap and pool runoff, allowing \nbiological transformations to occur. With a steady non-storm flow the utility of these in-stream \nBMPs can be diminished. To effectively treat this type of runoff, BMPs should be capable of \ntreating or reusing large volumes of water. Therefore, for areas of the watershed characterized by \nboth development and irrigation, the primary BMPs will be tail water recovery systems, on farm \nwater storage reservoirs, and treatment wetlands. \n Given these considerations, the management practices currently targeted for the Overcup Slough \nwatershed include: \n \n• Nutrient and sediment BMPs, \n• Enroll marginal agricultural lands in wetland restoration programs, \n• Water management projects \n• Water quantity projects \n \n \n  \n7.3.1 Nutrient and Sediment BMPs \n \n Overcup Slough has been targeted for monitoring and installation of BMPs to reduce nutrient and \nsediment loads in cropland runoff. Specific nutrient and sediment BMPs that will be installed include:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n• Low-grade weirs, \n• Irrigation tailwater recovery systems, \n• Irrigation land leveling, \n• Underground irrigation pipeline, \n• Grade stabilization structures, \n• Two stage ditches, \n• Grassed waterways, \n• Dropped inlet structures, \n• Input management, and \n• Conservation easements. \n \n \nThese BMPs are discussed below. \n \n \n \n7.3.1.1 Low-grade Weirs \nInstallation of low-grade weirs in agricultural drainage ditches can improve water quality \nthrough removal of sediment and nutrients. The weirs slow flow during storm events and allow \nsediment to be deposited. In addition, holding water in the ditches behind the weirs creates \nenvironments that encourage biogeochemical transformation of nutrients, as well as contribute to \ngroundwater recharge (Kroger et al 2008a). One study in the Delta determined that low-grade \nweirs reduced annual phosphorus loads from cropland runoff by over 40% (Kroger et al. 2008). \nLow-grade weirs will be installed in ditches t   hroughout the watershed as funding allows through various \ncost share programs. (Figure 7.1). Table 7.1 provides additional information about installation of low-\ngrade weirs in the  Overcup Slough watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7.1.

The pad (a dike) routes flow through the pipe to provide an non-erodible \nroute for runoff as an alternative to unlined ditches or gullies. This practice has been classified \nby the Mississippi NRCS as having the potential to decrease sediment loads slightly to significantly.\n6\n  \nThis practice is not expected to significantly affect nutrient loads, except for phosphorus associated with \nsediment loads.\n7\n Pad and pipe systems have already been installed in Overcup Slough by some \nproducers in the watershed. However, there is potential for installation in additional locations throughout \nthe Overcup Slough watershed (Figure 7.1). These systems could be designed and installed by the \nlandowner, with assistance from Delta F.A.R.M or NRCS. Financial assistance for installation and \nmaintenance of these systems may be provided by through the EPA Section 319 grant funds, NRCS cost \nshare programs, or privately funded by the landowner or producer. See Table 7.2 for details of the plans \nfor installing these systems in the Overcup Slough catchment. \n \n \n7.3.1.3 Irrigation Tailwater Recovery Systems \nTailwater recovery systems collect irrigation runoff water for reuse. This makes for more \nefficient use of irrigation water. Holding runoff water, such as in a collection pond, allows \nsediment to settle out, and creates environments that encourage biogeochemical transformation \nof nutrients, as well as contribute to groundwater recharge. In addition to water use management \nand water quality improvement, tailwater recovery ponds can benefit several of the species of \nconcern identified in Section 3.3. Tailwater recovery systems are planned for the watershed and will be \ninstalled where suitable. (Figure 7.2). The systems will be designed to recover drainage from cropland in \nthe watershed. Systems may be designed and installed by the landowner with assistance from NRCS and \nDelta F.A.R.M.  Financial assistance for installation of systems may be available from NRCS programs \nand/or EPA 319 grant funds.

Land \nleveling is an eligible practice for the NRCS, MRBI-CCPI and EQIP programs. See Table 7.4 for  \ndetails of the plans for implementing this practice in the Overcup Slough watershed. \n \n \n7.3.1.5 Underground Irrigation Pipeline \nThis practice involves installing low pressure, underground plastic pipeline for the \nconveyance of water for irrigation. Use of underground pipe can reduce erosion and water loss, \nand is a necessary component of other practices such as land leveling and tailwater recovery.  \nInstallation of underground irrigation pipe is an eligible practice for the NRCS, MRBI-CCPI and EQIP \nprograms. Based on historical averages, it is estimated that approximately 20,000 feet of low pressure, \nunderground, plastic pipe will be installed for irrigation water in the Overcup Slough watershed.

Grassed waterways are eligible practices for the MRBI-CCPI and EQIP program, and may  \nbeinstalled at potential locations in the watershed. See Table 7.6 for additional information on the \nplans for installation of grassed waterways in the Overcup Slough watershed. \n \n \n \n7.3.1.8 Two-stage Ditches \nConstructing or modifying agricultural drainage ditches to include a small channel to \ncarry effective discharge and benches to act as floodplains during higher flows. This type of \nconstruction can increase the stability of the ditch, reduce maintenance, and improve ecological \nfunction (NEH, 2007). See Table 7.7 for additional information on the plans for installation of \n two-stage ditches in the Overcup Slough watershed. \n \n \n \n7.3.1.9 Conservation Easements \nEnrolling land in conservation programs can reduce erosion and runoff of sediment and \nnutrients. These lands can reduce erosion through stabilizing soil. Conservation lands can also \nact as filters to remove sediment and nutrients in runoff. Conservation programs generally \nprovide some kind of financial incentive or compensation in return for removing the land from \ncultivation, such as rental payments, cost-share for restoration work, or tax credits. The USDA \nmanages several programs for land conservation in Mississippi, including the Conservation \nReserve Program, Conservation Stewardship Program, and Wildlife Habitat Enhancement \nProgram. The Mississippi Fish and Wildlife Foundation also manage a conservation easement \nprogram, as does the Mississippi Land Trust and Ducks Unlimited and Delta Wildlife \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  14\n\n \n \nT\nable 7.6 \nImplement In\n-\nfield Sediment Management Practices\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  15 \n \n \n \n \n\nTable 7.7\n \nDesign, Construct, and Maintain Two\n-\nStage Ditches\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n 7-  16 \n   \n    \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.3.1.10 Input Management \n             Precision agriculture refers to one technique for managing crop inputs and yields using \nspatially referenced monitoring of field nutrient content, soil quality, and crop yield to more precisely \napply fertilizers and pesticides using computer controlled equipment (Hudson and Hite 2001). Precision \nagriculture is expected to reduce the amount of inputs producers use, reducing their production costs,  \nand runoff and infiltration of fertilizer nutrients and pesticide chemicals. \n             There is currently concern among Delta producers about the high start-up costs of precision \nagriculture, and the uncertainty about whether the technique actually increases producer profits. There is \nalso uncertainty among producers about how to implement the techniques, and if it is even needed in the \nDelta. This technique was developed in the upper Midwest, which has very different soils and nutrient \ncycling than the Delta. Table 7.8 contains  additional information. \n \n \n \n7.3.2 Enroll Lands in Wetland Reserve Program \n Natural and constructed wetlands have been shown to improve water quality through removal of \nsediment and nutrients. Slower flow through the wetlands allows sediments to be deposited. Nutrients are \nused by wetland plants, and sorbed by wetland soils. The wet environment encourages biogeochemical \ntransformation of nutrients. In addition, wetlands contribute to groundwater recharge . \n Overcup Slough watershed is a target watershed under the MRBI Wetland Reserve Enhancement \nProgram (WREP). Approximately 7,905 acres of wetlands currently exist in the Overcup Slough \nwatershed (Figure 2.3). There are already a few wetland easements in the watershed.  Financial assistance \nfor design, installation, and maintenance of restored wetlands will be available from the NRCS through \nthe WREP.  See Table 7.9 for additional information about wetland restoration activities planned for \nOvercup Slough watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  17                                                      \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.3.3 Wildlife Management \nProjects may be implemented in the Overcup Slough watershed with the purpose of \nimproving and extending habitat for wildlife, primarily birds. These include restoration and \nmanagement of wetlands through the Wetland Reserve Program, and shallow water development \nand management. Restored wetlands can provide wintering habitat, migratory stop-over sites, \nlate summer/fall foraging sites, and breeding/nesting habitat for a number of waterfowl, forest, \nand migratory bird species. Shallow water development and management involves inundating \nfields during the winter to provide habitat for wildlife, including native and migrating waterfowl, \nmigrating shorebirds, amphibians, and fish. As noted in Section 7.3.2, wetland restoration and \nmanagement activities in Overcup Slough are eligible for assistance under the MRBI WREP. \nShallow water development in Overcup Slough watershed is eligible for assistance under the NRCS \nEQIP and MRBI-CCPI programs. See Table 7.10 for additional information about shallow water \ndevelopment planned for Overcup Slough watershed. \nOther management practices also have the potential to improve or extend habitat for \nwildlife. Tailwater recovery ponds (Section 7.3.1.3) and on-farm storage ponds (Section 7.3.4.2) \ncan provide habitat for waterfowl and amphibians. \n \n \n \n7.3.4 Water Management Projects \nWater management activities anticipated for Overcup Slough include in-channel storage, \ntailwater recovery systems, on-farm storage, and irrigation water management.

Development of off-channel water storage is an eligible \npractice under the MRBI-CCPI, AWEP and EQIP programs. Landowners will design and install off-\nchannel water storage with assistance from NRCS and Delta F.A.R.M. Priority locations for off-channel \nwater storage will be determined based on program prioritization criteria (Section 6.2). See Table 7.11 \nfor additional information on installation of off-channel storage in the Overcup Slough watershed. \n \n \n \n7.3.4.2 Irrigation Water Management \n Irrigation water management consists of practices to track and control the volume, \nfrequency, and application rate of irrigation water in a planned and efficient manner. Irrigation \nwater management may be implemented in the Overcup Slough watershed through the MRBI CCPI, \nEQIP program. This may include implementation of the NRCS PHAUCET Irrigation Control Program. \nThis program helps producers design flat poly pipe furrow irrigation systems by identifying the \nappropriate hole sizes to punch in the pipe based on variables such as the well pump rate, field slope, \nrow lengths, and size of poly pipe (YMD 2009). This design assistance is expected to reduce water \nusage. Feedback from producers who have used PHAUCET has all been positive (YMD 2009).

These stakeholders were also \napprised of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy, and the associated planning in the Overcup Slough \nwatershed. \n \n \n \n8.2.2 Nutrient and Sediment BMPs \nThe data gathered from the monitoring associated with BMP installations in the Overcup Slough \nwatershed will be used to inform producers in the area, and the BMP sites will be included on informative \ntours. Stovall Farms lies in the Overcup Slough watershed and currently serves as a demonstration farm \nwhere BMPs are showcased during the numerous farm tours that are held each year. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.2.3 PHAUCET \n Mississippi State University, Delta F.A.R.M., NRCS and the YMD Water Management District \nwork to inform producers in the watershed about the PHAUCET program, its benefits and success, and \nhow to implement \nit. \n \n \n \n8.2.4 WRP Enrollment \nThe most effective outreach efforts are those that work one on one with individual \nlandowners, which is the process that will be used by both DW and NRCS in implementing \nthe WRP. NRCS will work with individual landowners first, to enroll land in WRP \nand draw up contracts for wetland easements. Once the contracts are signed, DW and NRCS will \ninclude the landowners in designing and constructing the WRP project, to ensure compatibility \nwith farming practices, and provide insight and information on how wetland functions benefit the \nlandowner. Ancillary benefits the landowner receives by having the WRP project on their \nproperty will be described and documented for use in future DW outreach and education. \nSustaining both the wetland functions and management activities over time will be \nsignificantly enhanced with three years of individual landowner outreach on wetland \nmanagement. After three years, the wetlands will be established and close to being self- \nsustaining. Further, after 3 years of individual consultation and encouragement, landowner \nmanagement activities are expected to become part of their routine farming practices. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8-  2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.3   Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy \n Ongoing activities associated with Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy are expected to contribute to \nthe awareness, education, and outreach goals of this plan. DNRS work groups routinely meet to discuss \nmonitoring, best management practices, water management, input management, etc.  Outcomes from these \nmeetings are incorporated into education/outreach materials which are disseminated to producers and the \ngeneral public through multiple outlets. \n \n \n8.4   Schedule \nActivities geared toward increasing awareness, outreach, and education will occur \nthroughout the process of contracting, designing, installing, maintaining, and documenting \nmanagement practices in the Overcup Slough watershed. A schedule for awareness, outreach, and \neducation activities described above will be developed as funding sources are secured for plan \nimplementation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.5   Budget \nAwareness, outreach, and education activities planned in Overcup Slough watershed will be \nfunded through grants and agency operations budgets.

Current efforts by MDEQ, \nUSGS, and MSU are monitoring flow, sediment, N, and P, and other constituents during both base flow \nand storm flow, prior to, and after, construction and implementation of conservation management \npractices to determine the resulting percent reduction in sediment, N, and P at the multiple spatial tiers.  \nHowever, funding for these efforts is set to expire in 2014. See Figure 7.1 for monitoring locations. \n \n9.1.2 Habitat \n WRP Easement properties in the watershed are monitored on an annual basis by NRCS or a \ntechnical service provider such as Delta Wildlife.  Site conditions are documented and reported to NRCS \nwho maintains the records for each easement property. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9.1.3 Water Levels \n \nGround water levels in Overcup Slough watershed are routinely monitored at selected wells \nby YMD. YMD surveys water levels in 550 wells throughout the Delta every year in the spring \nand fall (YMD 2008). There are no USGS continuous ground water monitoring wells located in \nthe Overcup Slough watershed, although there are two wells located near Clarksdale.\n8\n \nSurface water levels do not appear to be routinely monitored at any water body in the \nOvercup Slough watershed. Water levels in the Sunflower River are monitored by a USGS gage \ndownstream of Overcup Slough at Sunflower.\n9\n \n \n \n \n9.1.4 Water Use Survey \n \nYMD conducts an annual water use survey for the five major crop types in the Delta – \ncorn, cotton, soybeans, rice, and catfish. Between 100 and 150 sites are surveyed each year. \nIrrigation water volumes are e\n\nstimated based on pump flow rate and monthly electricity usage. \n \n \n \n \n9.1.5 Schedule \nThe schedule for monitoring activities well be developed as funding sources are made available. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ms/nwis/gw \n9\n http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ms/nwis/dv/?site_no=07288500&amp;referred_module=sw \n \n \n \n \n9-  2\n\nMonitoring Activity Budget Funding Source \nWater quality \n  \n \n \nEPA/MDEQ/USGS \nWetland habitat Agency Budgets NRCS \nGround water levels Agency Budget YMD \nWater use Agency Budget YMD \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9.1.6 Budget \nBudget information for monitoring activities is summarized in Table 9.1. \n \nTable 9.1.

Restoration of wetlands \nalso has a target of increasing the area available for groundwater recharge in the Overcup Slough \nwatershed by 3 acres. \n \n \n \n9.3   Assessment \nImplementation milestones and schedules have been developed for the management \nactions and education and outreach activities described in this plan. For implementation to be \nconsidered successful, all activity milestones must be met on time. The Team will meet quarterly \nto review progress on achieving the milestones and make needed adjustments to the schedule. \nEach Team member serves as the chair for one of the major management categories, such as \nsewerage, sediment and nutrient loading, etc. There is a subcommittee associated with each of \nthese categories to ensure that the management actions are implemented. \nIn addition, the success of the implementation of this plan in achieving the management \ntargets specified in Section 9.2, will be evaluated no later than 2016. This will be accomplished \nby the Watershed Implementation Team, or its designee(s), compiling and renewing available \nmonitoring data (Section 9.1) and comparing results to the targets. A short report will be \nprepared by the evaluators, summarizing the results of their review. This information will be \nprovided to all interested stakeholders and implementation participants in preparation for \nrevising the Overcup Slough Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). \n \n \n \n9.3.1 Plan \nSpecific management action schedules toward achieving the vision for the Overcup Slough \nwatershed are described in Chapter 7.0 and summarized in Table 7.12. If the schedules are not \nbeing met, the causes behind the failure to meet the goals will be determined, and actions will be \ntaken. Specific management action goals and/or expectations are described in Chapter 7.0. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9-  5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9.3.2 Education and Outreach \nSpecific goals and/or expectations for education and outreach activities are described in \nChapter 8.0. If the activity goals were not met, the causes behind the failure to meet the goals \nwill be determined. In addition, the plan activities will be evaluated with regard to information \nand knowledge about the watershed and its waterbodies that has been gained since the existing \nplan was developed, as well as any relevant physical changes in the watershed or changes in \npolicy affecting the watershed. Implementation of the activities will be reevaluated in light of all \nof this information on a quarterly basis, as discussed above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9-  6 \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n10.1 Overall WIP Budget \n \n \n \n \nTable 10.1 Watershed Implementation Plan Budget Summary \nActivity NRCS EPA 319 Producer Other Total \nBMPs  $          6,479,218   $          3,649,870   $          3,737,746   $                   -     $  13,866,834  \nMonitoring  $                          -     $                90,000   $                          -     $          90,000   $        180,000  \nOutreach  $                30,000   $                45,000   $                          -     $          30,000   $        105,000  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  10-1 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11.0 PLAN REVISION \n \n \n \nDependent on approval and funding, the Watershed Implementation Team will prepare a \n revised WIP, incorporating the changes requested by the reviewers and reconciling any conflicting \ncomments or requests for change. \nThe WIP will be submitted to the Watershed Implementation Team and all others \nwho submitted comments.
