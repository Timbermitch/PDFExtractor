The watershed is located in the Delta physiographic region, \n in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain Northern Holocene Meander Belts ecoregion. Geology in this area  \nconsists of mostly unconsolidated deposits of sands, silts, and clays dating back as far as the Pleistocene \n(Stewart 2003). \n Only one municipality exists in the watershed, the City of Shaw (Figure 2.1). Several smaller \ncommunities are scattered throughout the watershed including Choctaw and Fraizer. State Highways 61,  \n278, 442, and 448 pass through the watershed. Cleveland and Indianola  are two larger municipalities in  \nclose proximity (i.e., within 10 miles). \n \n \n \n2.2    Soils \n \nSoils in the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain physiographic region are primarily young \nsoils (inceptisols) formed on alluvium, and range from mildly acidic to mildly alkaline \n(Stewart 2003). The 20,039 acre watershed is diverse, ranging from frequently flooded areas \nwith heavy clay soils to well drained “cotton ground” with sandy loam soils. Alligator \n(poorly drained clay), Dundee (moderately to somewhat poorly drained fine sandy loam to silty \nclay loam), and Forestdale (somewhat poorly to poorly drained silty clay loam) soils are \npredominant throughout the watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.1. Middle Porter Bayou Watershed, Mississippi \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.3    Hydrology \n \nThe tributaries of Middle Porter Bayou vary from roadside ditches and drainage canals to  \nUpper Porter Bayou proper which transitions to Middle Porter Bayou at Shaw, MS. Traveling  \ndownstream, the bayou meanders through parts of Bolivar and Sunflower Counties in a large  \n“horseshoe” fashion. Certain portions of the bayou are wide with gently sloping banks defined by  \ncypress trees, while other portions are extremely narrow with high, steep banks. Eventually, Middle  \nPorter Bayou transitions to Lower Porter Bayou which then empties in to the Sunflower River north  \nof Indianola, MS. Non-storm flows in Delta streams naturally decrease during summer months due to  \nlow rainfall. However, in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed, irrigation water often supplements  \nsummer non-storm flows by providing a constant source of runoff throughout the growing season. \nThe watershed is characterized by poor drainage. The slow, meandering nature of the \nbayou has resulted in the accumulation of sediments and dense vegetation, both of which \nnegatively impact drainage. \n \n \n \n2.4    Land Use \n \nA map of watershed land use is shown in Figure 2.2. Production agriculture comprises about 89% \n(18,804 acres) of the w atershed. Soybeans are the dominant crop although; corn, cotton, and rice are all \ncommon. In addition to production agriculture, there are several hundred acres of open water mostly \ncomprised of Porter Bayou. There are also about three thousand acres of wetlands. The city of Shaw is the \nonly area of urban development within the watershed. \n \n \n \n2.5    Socioeconomics \n \n \n2.5.1    Demographics \n \n           According to the 2010 census, the population for Bolivar County was 34,145, and 29,450 for \n Sunflower County\n1\n. In Both counties the 2010 population was down from the 2008 estimated population. \n \n \n \n \n_________________________________________ \n1\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml \n \n \n \n2-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.5.2    Economy \n \nShaw, is the principal town within the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. There are a few small  \nbusiness within the town but the principal industry in the watershed is production agriculture. In  \naddition to row crop agriculture, catfish farming is an important contributor to the economy of  \nSunflower County, and occurs in the Porter Bayou watershed (MSU 2009). The Delta region of  \nMississippi where Porter Bayou is located is classified as economically depressed. The estimated 2008  \nmedian household income for Bolivar County ($28,779) and Sunflower County ($28,266) were both  \nbelow the state median household income ($37,818), and were in the lowest 11% of the state\n2\n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.2.

NPDES Point Sources \nThere is one NPDES permitted wastewater discharge that discharges in the Porter Bayou \nwatershed. The Shaw Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) discharges in to Porter Bayou \n(permit # MS0024953)(enSearch, accessed June 2010). The Shaw POTW has a design flow \ncapacity of 0.36 MGD. \n \n \n \n \n2.6.1.1.2. NPDES Stormwater \nThe Middle Porter Bayou Watershed does not appear to be subject to MS4 storm water \npermitting under the Clean Water Act. Construction activities disturbing an area greater than \n1 acre are subject to NPDES stormwater regulations. \n \n \n \n2.6.1.1.3. 303(d) and TMDLs \nPorter Bayou was placed on the Mississippi 2006 Section 303(d) List of Impaired Water \nBodies (MDEQ 2007). Porter Bayou was listed due to evaluated causes of sediment/siltation, \norganic enrichment/low dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and total toxics (Figure 2.3). The Clean \nWater Act requires that total maximum daily load (TMDL) studies be completed for all water \nbodies included on the 303(d) list. Table 2.1 summarizes the TMDLs addressing Porter Bayou \nwater quality impairments that have been completed as of June 2010. Because these TMDLs \nhave been completed, Porter Bayou does not appear on the  2010 303(d) list (MDEQ 2010). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.3.

TMDLs for Porter Bayou \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.6.1.1.4. Navigable Waters \nSeveral sections of the Clean Water Act deal with controlling impacts to navigable \nwaters. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act controls the placement of dredge or fills materials into \nwetlands and other waters of the US. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires MDEQ to \ncertify that a project requiring a Section 10 (see 2.6.1.2) or Section 404 permit will not violate \nthe state water quality standards. These sections of the Clean Water Act require that impacts to \nqualifying waterbodies be avoided or minimized. Where impacts are unavoidable, mitigation \nmay be required. Qualifying waterbodies include wetlands and “Other Waters of the US”. The \nbasic definition for Other Waters of the US, for the purpose of Section 404, is any waterbody \nthat displays an ordinary high water mark (OHWM). This includes lakes and ponds that have a \nhydrological connection to a qualifying waterbody, and perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral \nstream channels which exhibit an OHWM. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nadministers the regulations associated with both of these sections. \nThe USACE issues two types of permits under Section 404; Individual Permits and \nNationwide Permits (NWPs). Individual Permits are required when 1) impacts to wetlands \nexceed 0.5 acre, and/or 2) greater than 300 linear feet of a qualifying waterbody is to be \nimpacted. This Individual Permit includes a period of public review, and processing generally \ntakes between 60 and 120 days. The processing time can be greater if public hearings or \nenvironmental statements are required, or if all required information on the permit application \nform is not provided. NWPs are general permits typically used when minor impacts are \nnecessary to wetlands (less than 0.5 acre) or a qualifying waterbody (any impacts less than \n300 linear feet). Processing time is generally less and no public review period is necessary. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMitigation for both wetland losses or stream function and value losses may be required \nby the USACE for a project authorized under either an individual or nationwide permit. The \nextent of the mitigation is dependent upon the size, quality, and functionality of the wetland or \nwaterbody to be impacted. \n \n \n \n2.6.1.2 Rivers and Harbors Act \n \nSection 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act regulates activities that have the potential to \nobstruct navigation in waters of the US, including wetlands. \n \n \n2.6.1.3 Farm Bill \n \nUnder the Federal Food Security Act (Farm Bill), initially passed in 1985, all US farm \noperators are required to follow soil and wetland conservation guidelines specified in the law \n(i.e., Sodbuster and Swampbuster programs). Compliance with these guideline is a prerequisite \nfor participation in most federal farm programs. Subsequent amendments to the Farm Bill have \nadded programs that provide incentives to farm operators for enhancing water quality through \nsuch actions as taking highly erodible lands out of production, and restoring wetlands. One such \nprogram is the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative (MRBI). The MRBI is \nbeing implemented through NRCS programs funded by the Farm Bill, including the Cooperative \nConservation Partnership Initiative, Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program, and Conservation \nInnovation Grants. The Middle Porter Bayou Watershed is a target sub-watershed of the Sunflower \nRiver watershed for the MRBI. \n \n \n \n2.6.1.4 National Flood Insurance Program \n \nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a non-regulatory federal program, \nwhich is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, this \nprogram provides mechanisms that can be used to restrict development in floodplains, which can \nhave beneficial effects on water quality. The NFIP supports development and enforcement of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfloodplain management plans and ordinances. All of the unincorporated areas of Bolivar and \nSunflower Counties participate in the NFIP, as well as the City of Shaw\n3\n. \n \n \n2.6.1.5 Safe Drinking Water Act \n \nAll drinking water systems serving 25 people or more are considered public drinking \nwater systems and are subject to EPA regulation through the Safe Drinking Water Act. Elements \nof the Safe Drinking Water Act include the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, Disinfection \nByproducts Rule, and the requirement for Source Water Assessment and Protection. In Mississippi,  \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act is administered by the Mississippi State Department of Health. The lists  \nof public water utilities provided on the Mississippi State Department of Health website indicate that  \nthere is one public water utility serving the residents of the Porter Bayou watershed – the Town of  \nShaw\n4\n. According to the EPA Safe Drinking Water Information System, the Shaw utility water source  \nis groundwater, it serves 2,319 people, and the only drinking water quality standard violation was for  \nfecal coliforms in 2002\n5\n. \n \n \n \n2.6.2    State \n2.6.2.1 Water Quality Standards \n \nThe water use classifications are established by the State of Mississippi in the document \nState of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters (MDEQ, \n2007). The designated beneficial use for Middle Porter Bayou is Fish and Wildlife (MDEQ 2008).                 \nThe water quality standard applicable to the use of the water body and the pollutant of concern is \n defined in the State of Mississippi Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters \n(MDEQ,2007). Mississippi’s current standards contain a narrative criteria that can be applied to nutrients \nwhich states “Waters shall be free from materials attributable to municipal, industrial, agricultural, \nor other discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, sediment, \nturbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the waters injurious to \npublic health, recreation, or to aquatic life and wildlife, or adversely affect the palatability of fish, \naesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated use (MDEQ, 2007).” \n \n \n \n3 http://www.msema.org/insurance/floodplain.html \n4 http://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/30,0,76,256.html \n5 http://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/sdw_form_v2.create_page?state_abbr=MS \n \n \n2-  9\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe standard for dissolved oxygen states, “DO concentrations shall be maintained at a \ndaily average of not less than 5.0 mg/l with an instantaneous minimum of not less than 4.0 mg/l.” In \naddition, the State water quality standard regulations include a natural condition clause which was \nused in the TMDL to determine the appropriate DO for Porter Bayou under critical conditions. \nNatural conditions are defined as background water quality conditions due only to non-anthropogenic \nsources. The DO numeric criteria apply specifically with regard to substances attributed to sources \n(discharges, nonpoint sources, or instream activities) as opposed to natural phenomena. Waters may \nnaturally have characteristics outside the limits established by these criteria. Therefore, naturally \noccurring conditions that fail to meet criteria should not be interpreted as violations of these criteria \n(MDEQ 2007). \n \n \n2.6.2.2 Highway Construction Runoff \n \nThe Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) is responsible for implementation \nof erosion and sediment control practices on highway construction. MDOT is required to apply to \nMDEQ for a Certificate of Permit Coverage for construction projects to be permitted through the \nstate construction storm water general permit. As of August 9, 2013, there are no active water \npermits for highway construction in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed (MDEQ enSearch) \n \n \n \n2.6.2.3 On-Site Wastewater Treatment Regulations \n \nState regulations addressing on-site wastewater treatment systems are administered \nthrough the Mississippi State Department of Health. Regulations are in place to address single- \nfamily residence on-site wastewater treatment systems, as well as on-site systems serving \nrecreational vehicle campgrounds, developments, and multi-family dwellings. These regulations \nrequire approval and certification of all new installations of on-site wastewater treatment \nsystems, including replacement of old systems. Certification is not required for systems in use \nprior to enactment of the regulations, providing they meet criteria specified in the regulations.\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________________________________ \n6\n http://www.msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/30,0,78.html \n \n \n \n2-  10\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.6.2.4 Fish Consumption Advisories \n \nFish tissue sampling is conducted by MDEQ for the purpose of identifying potential \nhuman health threats. These data are used by a multi-agency task force to evaluate the need for \nfish consumption advisories in Mississippi. Porter Bayou is included in the Delta-wide \nconsumption advisory for toxaphene and DDT. This advisory recommends that people limit \nconsumption of carp, buffalo, gar, and catfish larger than 22 inches to no more than one meal \nevery two weeks (MSDH 2001). \n \n \n \n2.6.2.5 Water Withdrawals \n \nUnder Mississippi law, all wells drilled with a casing diameter of 6 inches or greater are \nrequired to have a water use permit. In addition, water use permits are required for surface water \nwithdrawals, and construction of water storage impoundments. Permits are good for 10 years. \nThe Yazoo Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District (YMD) is responsible for \nprocessing water use permits in the Delta, including the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. Water use \npermits are issued by the MDEQ State Permit Board. Stakeholders are concerned about requirements \nto meter groundwater withdrawals because of future implications. \n \n \n \n \n2.7    Existing Management \n \nNumerous drainage improvement efforts have been made over the years, and intense \nefforts are ongoing, including; 1) Stream Bank Restoration, and 2) Alligator Weed Control and \nEradication. Numerous sediment reducing BMPs have been voluntarily implemented throughout the \nwatershed. Sediment reducing measures are also an integral part of the above projects. \nThe NRCS has sponsored watershed protection and flood prevention work in the \nwatershed starting in 2003 under the authority of (CFR 68(10): 2007 and Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program [EQIP] 7 CFR Part 1466). Middle Porter Bayou is primarily used for agricultural \ndrainage and as a source for irrigation water. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2-  11\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.0 RESOURCES AND CONDITION \n \n3.1    Water Quality \n \nUSGS and MSU began water quality sampli\n\nng in 2010 within the watershed. MSU began \nsampling at edge of field and near field locations( tier 1) in order to monitor water leaving \nagricultural fields. USGS began sampling in tributaries farther downstream and within Porter \nBayou itself (tier 2). These monitoring efforts have led to a greater understanding of water quality \nwithin the bayou and leaving crop fields. As noted in Section 2.6.1.1.3, Middle Porter Bayou has \nbeen identified by MDEQ as not having water quality adequate to support its designated uses \n(listed in Section 2.6.2.1). However, this water quality assessment was an evaluated assessment, \nnot based on water quality data.  \n \n3.2    Water Quantity \n \nWater supply is a growing concern in the region. Ground water use in the \nMississippi Alluvial Plain has resulted in lower flows in many streams, including the Sunflower \nRiver (MS Museum of Natural Science 2005). The Middle Porter Bayou Watershed is near the area of \ngreatest groundwater decline in the Delta (YMD 2008). In the watershed, ground water is \nwithdrawn for drinking water and to irrigate crops. \n \n \n3.3    Wildlife and Habitat \nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service has identified seven endangered or threatened species that may \noccur in or around the Porter Bayou Watershed. These species include; Fat Pocket Book mussels, \nRabbit’s Foot mussels, Sheepnose mussel, Least Tern, Pallid Stugeon (Occurs in Mississippi River), and \nPondberry.  Efforts to protect or enhance the habitats of the aforementioned species will be a high \npriority during the execution of the watershed plan. While the three mussels listed as endangered or \nthreatened are normally found in larger riverine ecosystems restoration of streams in Porter Bayou may \nbenefit these mussels. Least Terns will benefit greatly from shallow water management in wetlands and \nagricultural fields. These shallow water areas provide ideal feeding location for these shore birds. Pallid \nSturgeon will benefit due to the fact that water leaving Porter Bayou and entering the Sunflower River \nand eventually the MS River will be carrying less sediments and nutrients. Pondberry is an important \nwetland species. With on-going and future projects Pondberry habitat may be increased or enhanced.  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n3-  1 \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.4    Evaluation of Porter Bayou Fish Community \n \nThis evaluation of the Porter Bayou fish community is based on sampling performed by \nERDC (Engineering Research and Development Center, US Army Corps of Engineers, \nVicksburg, MS). Sampling was performed as part of stream community monitoring conducted by \nERDC to assess the condition of fish communities in MS Delta streams. The sampling data \nprovided the basis for the development of an index of biotic integrity sensu Karr (1981). The \nindex uses metrics that capture the variety of feeding types (e.g. insectivores, predators), habitat \nselection (e.g. preferring current vs. pools) and taxonomy (e.g. sunfish and minnows) present in \na sample of fish. Sampling was conducted with seines according to a standardized protocol. Each \nsampling site was assigned an IBI score based on the values of the population metrics. Streams \nwere categorized as large unregulated or small, and flowing or non-flowing. Higher IBI scores \nindicate a more diverse fish community. \nTwo Porter Bayou sampling locations were placed in the small flowing category while 3 \nlocations were placed in the flowing category. Sampling was conducted at all 5 locations on \nOctober 2 and 3, 1996 and showed IBI values ranging from 11 to 15 and 9 to 13 for the \nnon-flowing and flowing categories, respectively. These values are compared with other streams \nin both the flowing and non-flowing categories in Table 3.1. The results show that, at the time of \nsampling, the quality of the Porter Bayou fish communities could be described as generally in the \nlower quartile among similar streams. The applicability of these results, which were obtained \nin 1996, would depend on whether significant changes in habitat and water quality have occurred \nbetween 1996 and the present. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3-  2\n\n \nSmall \nNon-flowing \nSmall \nFlowing \nSmall Flowing + Non-Flowing \nPercentile \n25 11 13 13 \n50 14 15 15 \n75 17 17 17 \n Porter Bayou \nHwy 448 11 --  \nMiket Rd 15 --  \nBritt Rd. -- 10  \nIndianola -- 13  \nOlivehale -- 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 3.1.

The issues identified by these \nstakeholders included water management, sediment, nutrients, invasive aquatic plants, declining \ngroundwater levels, herbicide-resistant weeds. \n \n \n4.1    Water Management \n \nWater management issues include both flooding and water shortages. The stakeholders \nidentified flooding as a priority concern in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. They also identified a \nneed for improved water use efficiency and storage capacity. The potential effects of improvements,  \nor lack thereof,  may impact flooding on other land parcels was also a stakeholder concern. \n \n \n \n4.1.1    Locations where Water Management is an Issue \nStakeholders stated that flooding is an issue throughout the watershed. Insufficient flow \ncapacity in the Middle Porter Bayou channel upstream of Shaw was identified by stakeholders as a \nparticular area of concern. \n \n \n \n4.1.2    Causes \nDuring storms, water backs up and causes flooding. During the growing season, rainfall \nand surface water are not adequate to support crops. \n \n \n \n4.1.3    Sources \nTerrain in the watershed is relatively flat, making it less likely to drain well during \nstorms. In addition, the dominant soil types in the watershed are characterized by poor drainage. \nStakeholders identified sedimentation as contributing to flooding by reducing the conveyance \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncapacity of ditches and streams. Beaver dams were also identified by stakeholders as \ncontributing to flooding in the watershed. Regional climate determines the natural availability of \nwater during the growing season. \n \n \n4.2    Water Level Declines \n \nThe Middle Porter Bayou Watershed is near the area of greatest groundwater decline in the Delta \n(YMD 2008). Regional estimates of groundwater level change in the Delta indicate that between \n1998 and 2008 the average groundwater level change in the area of the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed \nwas between 0.4 and 0.9 foot per year (YMD 2008). \n \n \n \n4.2.1    Locations where Water Level  Declines are an Issue \nGroundwater levels are declining throughout the watershed (YMD 2008). \n \n \n \n4.2.2    Cause \nWater is being withdrawn from the Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer faster than it is \nbeing recharged. Base flows in most Delta streams naturally decrease during the summer months \ndue to less rainfall. \n \n \n \n4.2.3    Sources \nIrrigation accounts for the majority of the ground and surface water withdrawals in the \nMiddle Porter Bayou Watershed. As noted in Section 2.6.1.5, groundwater is also used to supply drinking \nwater in the watershed. \n \n \n \n4.3    Sediment \n \nStakeholders noted that sedimentation in ditches and streams contributes to flooding by \nreducing storage and flow conveyance capacity. There is a clear understanding among producers \nthat sedimentation directly results in reduced drainage. Stakeholders identified channel maintenance as a \ncontinual problem. The presence of Herbicide-resistant weeds in the watershed may result in increased \ncultivation (i.e., decreased no-till practice), which could increase erosion and sediment loads. MDEQ has \ndetermined that there is a high probability that sediment loads in Porter Bayou are at such levels that they \n \n \n4-  2 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterfere with fish and other wildlife. High sediment loads can affect aquatic life by causing reduced \n visibility (when the sediment issuspended in the water column) or by changing stream habitat when the \nsediment is deposited (e.g., covering spawning areas). The sediment TMDL recommended that sediment \nloads be reduced, although the recommended percent reduction was not specified. \n \n \n4.3.1    Locations where Sediment is an Issue \nMDEQ has identified the entire stretch of Middle Porter Bayou as not supporting its  \ndesignated use of aquatic life support due to sediment. Producers and other stakeholders believe  \nerosion and sedimentation is an issue throughout the watershed. \n \n \n \n4.3.2    Cause \nSediment is the pollutant causing sedimentation and turbidity issues in Porter Bayou. \nSediment is caused by erosion of soil particles from land use activities in the watershed and \ndetachment of soil from the banks and beds of the bayou. Soils in the watershed tend to be fine \ngrained, which could make them more susceptible to erosion. \n \n \n \n4.3.3    Sources \nOn the Mississippi 2006 303(d) list, nonpoint sources are listed as the sources of \nsediment causing the impairment in Middle Porter Bayou. In the sediment TMDL that addresses this \nimpairment, a number of likely sediment sources were identified. These included agriculture, \nconstruction sites, roads, urban areas, mass wasting, gullies, channel instability, channel \nmodification, and historical land use activities. The stakeholders have identified unstable banks and  \ntopsoil erosion as a significant source of sediment in Middle Porter Bayou. \n \n \n4.4    Nutrient Enrichment \n \nStakeholders identified nutrients in runoff as an issue of concern. Stakeholders also \nexpressed concern about the costs associated with variable-rate fertilizer applications \n(i.e., precision agriculture). MDEQ has determined that there is a high probability that nutrient \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcentrations in Middle Porter Bayou are at levels that can create conditions harmful to fish and other \nwildlife. High nutrient concentrations can support unusually high growth of algae or other \naquatic plants. When the algae die, their decomposition uses oxygen from the water, which can \nresult in low oxygen levels that are harmful to fish and other aquatic life. The TMDL for Porter \nBayou recommends reduction of total phosphorus loads by around 95%, and reductions of total \nnitrogen loads by about 84% (MDEQ 2008). \n \n \n \n4.4.1    Locations where Nutrient Enrichment is an Issue \nMDEQ has identified the entire stretch of Middle Porter Bayou as not supporting its  \ndesignated use of aquatic life support due to nutrient enrichment. \n \n \n \n4.4.2    Cause \nNitrogen and phosphorus are the pollutants that are suspected of causing eutrophic \nconditions in these water bodies with high productivity and low dissolved oxygen levels. Total \nnitrogen and total phosphorus are the nutrients addressed in the TMDL (MDEQ 2008). \n \n \n \n4.4.3    Source \nNutrient loads are contributed by point sources and nonpoint sources in the watershed. \n \n \n \n4.4.3.1 Point Source \n \nThe Shaw POTW (MS0024953) permit is for the discharge of treated domestic \nwastewater (i.e., sewage). The NPDES permit for the Shaw POTW includes limits for ammonia, \ntotal nitrogen, and total phosphorus that will go into effect in 2013 at the latest. These limits are \nsummarized in Table 4.1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  4\n\nParameter \nMaximum monthly \naverage load \n(lb/day) \nMaximum daily \nload \n(lb/day) \nMaximum monthly \naverage \nconcentration \n(mg/L) \nMaximum daily \nconcentration \n(mg/L) \nAmmonia N 7.5 11.2 2.48 3.72 \nTotal nitrogen 34.5 69.0 na na \nTotal phosphorus 15.6 31.2 na na \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 4.1. Nutrient Limits in the NPDES permit for the Shaw POTW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.4.3.2 Nonpoint Sources \n \nThe Middle Porter Bayou Watershed WASP model indicated that the water quality impairment is \ndue to nutrients from nonpoint sources. In the nutrient TMDL for Middle Porter Bayou, cropland was \nassumed to be the greatest source of total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads (MDEQ 2008). In \naddition, the majority of nutrient loading to streams typically comes from storm water runoff. As noted in \nSection 2.5, there are approximately 18,804 acres of cropland in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. \nTotal nitrogen is a combination of many forms of nitrogen found in the environment. \nInorganic nitrogen can be transported in particulate and dissolved phases in surface runoff. \nDissolved inorganic nitrogen can be transported in groundwater and may enter a water body \nfrom groundwater infiltration. Finally, atmospheric gaseous nitrogen may enter a water body \nfrom\n atmospheric deposition (MDEQ 2008). \nPhosphorus is primarily transported in surface runoff when it has been sorbed by eroding \nsediment. Phosphorus may also be associated with fine-grained particulate matter in the \natmosphere and can enter streams as a result of dry fallout and rainfall (EPA 1999). Phosphorus \ncontained in the surface runoff due to fertilizers and animal excrement or watersheds with \nnaturally occurring soils that are rich in phosphorus (Thomann and Mueller, 1987). Watersheds \nwith a large number of failing septic tanks may also deliver significant loadings of phosphorus to \na water body (MDEQ 2008). Water in the Mississippi Alluvial Aquifer (located under Porter \nBayou watershed) is known to have a relatively high concentration of phosphorus. Therefore \nphosphorus can also enter surface waters from ground water seeps or discharges. USGS has an \non-going sampling program to quantify phosphorus in groundwater in the Delta. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.5    Organic Enrichment and Low DO \n \nThe presence of high levels of organic material in water bodies can reduce water oxygen \nlevels such that aquatic life cannot be supported. The TMDL addressing this impairment states \nthat reducing nutrient loads is expected to reduce organic enrichment and low dissolved oxygen \nconditions (MDEQ 2008). Therefore, no reduction is specified in the TMDL for organic material \n(TBODu). \n \n \n \n4.5.1    Locations where Organic Enrichment and Low DO are Issues \nMDEQ has identified Porter Bayou from the headwaters near Indianola to the confluence \nwith the Sunflower River as not supporting its designated use of aquatic life support due to \norganic enrichment and low dissolved oxygen. \n \n \n \n4.5.2    Cause \nThe nutrient TMDL assumed that nutrient enrichment was the cause of the organic \nenrichment and low dissolved oxygen conditions. As described in Section 4.2, high nutrient \nconcentrations in a water body can encourage the growth of aquatic plants, which can encourage \nthe growth of aquatic animals, all of which becomes organic material when it dies, and removes \noxygen from the water as it decomposes. High levels of organic material decomposing in a water \nbody deplete oxygen from the water and suffocate aquatic life. \n \n \n \n4.5.3    Sources \nWhile nutrient enrichment is believed to be the primary cause of organic enrichment and \nlow dissolved oxygen conditions cited for Porter Bayou, there are potential sources of organic \nmaterial in the watershed that may also contribute to these conditions. They are discussed below. \nSee Section 4.4.3 for a discussion of nutrient sources in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. \n \n \n \n4.5.3.1 Point Sources \n \nThe Shaw POTW (MS0024953) permit is for the discharge of treated domestic \nwastewater (i.e., sewage).

Oxygen-related NPDES Permit Limits for Shaw POTW \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.5.3.2 Nonpoint Sources \n \nOrganic material, such as crop residue, leaves, and chaff, can be washed into the water \nbody from the surrounding land, and exert an oxygen demand as they decompose. Sources can \nalso include plants along the stream banks. \n \n \n \n \n4.6    Pesticides \n \nA fish consumption advisory is in effect for long-lived pesticides in selected fish species \nthat covers all Delta streams and lakes, including those in the Porter Bayou watershed (see \nSection 2.6.2.4). Pesticide concentrations in soils, surface water or groundwater have not been \nidentified as a health concern. \nStakeholders identified herbicide-resistant weeds as an issue in the watershed. New \nherbicide combinations are being developed to control these weeds. \n \n \n \n4.6.1    Locations where Pesticides are an Issue \nLegacy pesticides in fish are an issue for all Delta water bodies, including Porter Bayou \nand all other water bodies in the watershed. Herbicide-resistant weeds occur throughout the \nwatershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.6.2    Causes \nDDT and Toxaphene are the pesticides named in the Delta-wide fish consumption \nadvisory. These pesticides degrade very slowly in the environment and are bioaccumulative, \nmeaning they accumulate in living tissue and can be passed on to other organisms, including \nhumans, through the food chain. Eventually, these pesticides can accumulate in ce\n\nrtain fish \nspecies to the point that eating those fish can cause health problems in people. DDT and \nToxaphene have been measured in fish tissue throughout the Delta at levels that may harm \nhuman health. \n \n \n \n4.6.3    Sources \nDDT and Toxaphene are no longer used in the US. The use of DDT was banned in the \nUS in 1973, and use of Toxaphene was banned in 1982. Historically, however, DDT and \nToxaphene were commonly used on croplands in the Delta, including the 18,804 acres of \ncropland in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. Because it takes decades for these chemicals to degrade, \nthey are still found in soils, sediments, and living organisms in the Delta. Recent measurements of \nconcentrations of DDT and Toxaphene in fish tissue collected from the Delta indicate that concentrations \nof these pesticides are decreasing (MDEQ 2001). This suggests that the residual DDT and Toxaphene is \nfinally degrading. \nProlonged extensive use of certain non-selective herbicides in the watershed has resulted in \nnatural selection for herbicide resistance in weeds. Farm equipment may facilitate transfer of \nresistant weed seeds among fields. \n \n \n \n4.7    Aquatic Weeds \n \n        Stakeholders identified alligator weed as a problem in the watershed, primarily due to reductions in    \ndrainage capacity and loss of habitat diversity Alligator weed is the object of an on-going New Porter \nBayou Drainage District eradication program. \n \n4.7.1    Locations \n \nAlligator weed is present throughout Middle Porter Bayou, however the heaviest infestations are  \nfound within approximately 10 miles upstream and 10 miles downstream of Shaw, Ms.  \n \n \n \n4-  8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   4.7.2 Causes \n Stream sedimentation has resulted in shallow water conditions thourghout Porter Bayou. \nDuring the growing season, shallow, warm water with loose sediments beneath is an excellent \nmedium for the establishment and growth of alligator weed. High growth rates exhibited by the \nplant give it a competitive advantage against native vegetation which has resulted in dense mats \nof monotypic alligator weed throughout the waterway. \n \n   4.7.3 Sources  \nWhile the exact source is difficult to determine, alligator weed is a non-native invasive \nplant that was likely introduced to the watershed through animal or water transfer.  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-  9\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5.0 RESTORATION AND PROTECTION GOALS \n \n \n5.1 Water Quality  \n \nThe restoration and protection goals for the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed are based, in part, on \nthe goal of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy; which is answering the following questions: \n \n            \n1.     What percent reduction of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loading is possible? \n2.     What do the sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus load reductions cost? \n3.     What are the benefits of these load reductions for stakeholders? \n4.      What nutrient load reductions will protect Delta water quality and the Gulf of Mexico?  \n \n \n5.2 Water Quantity  \n \nThe restoration and protection goals for the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed are also based partly on  \nthe goals of the Mississippi Delta  Sustainable Water Resources Initiative, some of which include the \nfollowing questions:  \n \n1.     How much groundwater recharge is possible in the watershed? \n2.      How much groundwater savings can be achieved with voluntary conservation measures? \n3.      How much groundwater savings can be achieved through the development and use of surface \n water resources in the watershed? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5-  1 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n       \n    6.0 TARGETING AND PRIORITIZATION \n \n 6.1 Introduction  \n \n BMPs are currently being implemented through a number of federal and state programs as well \nas by private landowners. Currently, the NRCS Environmental Quality Incentive Programs (EQIP) \nprovides financial and technical assistance for BMP implementation in the Middle Porter Bayou \nWatershed and throughout the Mississippi Delta. EQIP funds BMPs such as, tailwater recovery and \non-farm storage reservoirs, irrigation land-leveling, pipes, underground irrigation line, flow meters and \nothers. Other USDA programs that are putting best management practices on the ground include: \nAWEP, CCPI, MRBI, CSP, and WHIP. All of these USDA programs help land owners plan and \nimplement conservation practices that address natural resource concerns to help save energy, improve \nsoil, water, plant, air, animal and related resources on agricultural lands and non-industrial private \nforest land. Additionally, 319 project efforts are on-going through implementation of the Delta \nNutrient Reduction Strategy (DNRS).  Middle Porter Bayou was chosen as a watershed in which to \nimplement the DNRS, therefore and existing framework of BMPs and monitoring efforts are already \nin place.  \n Additional BMP needs were identified through a process that integrates technology with “boots \non the ground”.  The first step in the process involved gathering all relevant spatial information that \ncould be used to identify problems and underlying causes.  This information included soil maps, \nLIDAR and digital elevation models, NASS crop data, and aerial/satellite imagery. The spatial layers \nwere projected in ESRI-ArcMap within the confines of the 12 digit HUC watershed boundary (as \ndrafted by USGS), then each field was evaluated based on criteria defined by the Delta Nutrient \nReduction Strategy (DNRS 2009).  BMP needs were identified and spatially referenced.  The next step \nin the process was to physically inspect BMP sites as a means of ground truthing.  Producers were \nidentified and contacted to request permission for a visual assessment.  This assessment was used to \nfurther refine and project actual BMP needs.   Despite these efforts, site survey and design will still be \nrequired for many sites prior to implementation.  These efforts are costly and beyond the scope of \nthese preliminary projections. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 6-  1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6.2    Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy \n \n \nNutrient loading in agricultural effluent varies by region, watershed, and individual field. \nThe nutrient cycle in an agricultural watershed is an extremely complex system with many inputs \nand variables. To fully address the issue, a comprehensive approach must be used to ensure that \nall factors are considered. As part of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy, the Site \nCharacterization Work Group was tasked with developing a strategy to prioritize agricultural \nsystems for nutrient reduction. \nUsing this strategy, systems within the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed were classified based  \non soil type, cropping practices, and existing drainage infrastructure. Soils can be described as heavy \n(clays), medium (loams) light (sandy loams), and mixed (clay, loam, and sandy loams found in close \nproximity due to ridge and swale topography). Cropping practices were initially classified as irrigated \nor dry land, then by soybeans, rice/soybean rotation, cotton, or corn. Drainage infrastructure can be \nclassified as developed or undeveloped. Developed land typically consists of leveled or precision \ngraded fields with pipes, pads, and tailwater ditches, or ridge and swale land that has been shaped to \nfacilitate furrow irrigation. Undeveloped land includes areas with significant ridge and swale and/or \nsubject to frequent flooding. These areas are not \ndeveloped because the development cost exceeds potential benefits. \nProject sites within the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed will be selected for implementation of \nnutrient reduction BMPs (Figure 6.1). These proposed sites are characteristic of systems that are  \nrepresentative of the agricultural landscape throughout the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6-  2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6.3   Mississippi River Basin Initiative Cooperative Conservation Partnership \nInitiative \n \nCatchments with active or planned water quality monitoring will be given priority to \nreceive funds to implement BMPs under the Mississippi River Basin Initiative Cooperation \nConservation Partnership Initiative (MRBI-CCPI) program. Producers must submit applications \nfor funding to the appropriate NRCS county office. \n \n \n \n \n6.4    Mississippi River Basin Initiative Wetland Reserve Enhancement Program \n \nAreas within the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed will be prioritized for wetland restoration based \non gaps in waterfowl and wildlife habitat, existence of Wetland reserve Program (WRP) \ncontracts, and producer willingness to participate in WRP. Ranking criteria for high priority \nrestoration and enhancement projects, developed by DW and NRCS, include factors such as \nlocation, riparian buffers, water availability, proximity to other waterfowl habitat, and \nconnectivity with surrounding habitat. The Forest Breeding-Bird Decision Support Model results \nwill also be considered as part of the prioritization process. In consultation with local NRCS \nstaff, these ranking criteria will be used to help prioritize sites that would benefit from additional \nmanagement. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.1.

Alligator weed is selectively managed against to promote the \nre-growth of native marginal wetland plants such as smartweed. While the floodway is primarily \ndominated by a cypress/tupelo canopy, the NPBDD manages the understory vegetation for desirable \nherbaceous wetland plants, which provides significant improvements to water quality in the watershed.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6-  5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.0 MANAGEMENT \n \nThere are two underlying management principles of this WIP: ecosystem-based management and \nadaptive management. The goals and objectives of this plan reflect these principles. Each of these \nmanagement principles are briefly described below, followed by watershed management actions that \nare planned for the near future to work toward the vision for Middle Porter Bayou. Goals related to \nother existing or potential concerns in this watershed will be addressed in future implementation \nplans. \n \n \n \n7.1    Ecosystem-Based Management \n \nAn ecosystem-based approach is being used for watershed management in the Porter \nBayou watershed. Middle Porter Bayou and its watershed represent the ecosystem management unit. \nAlthough bayous and lakes are typically considered the ecosystem, water bodies and their \nwatershed are inexorably coupled. Land use and land cover activities in the watershed directly or \nindirectly affect the water body. Sediment and nutrient loadings from the watershed drive many \naquatic ecosystem processes, including both desirable and undesirable changes in the water \nbody. The ecosystem, however, is characterized not only by its environmental attributes, but also \nby its socioeconomic attributes. Humans are part of, not apart from, aquatic ecosystems. \nWatershed management is fundamentally a social activity (Thornton and Creager 2001). \n The benefits that accrue from reduced sediment and nutrient loadings to Middle Porter Bayou \nare not just in terms of increased water clarity, reduced sedimentation, reduced algal blooms, a more \nproductive sport fishery, and greater recreational and aesthetic values. The agricultural \ncommunity also benefits from reduced sediment and nutrient loadings. For example, Pimentel et \nal. (1995) estimated that each ton of sediment lost was worth about $6.75 per year to the farmer \n($5.00 per ton for lost nutrients, and $1.75 per ton for lost soil and water capacity). The Delta \nsediment TMDL estimates that at least 0.007 tons per acre per day of sediment is lost. Based on \nthis loss rate, just over approximately 48,180 tons of soil are lost from the Porter Bayou \nwatershed each year (18,804 acres x 0.007 x 365), and the minimum estimate of dollars lost from \nthe watershed is about $272,715 per year. This is equivalent to approximately $240,900 in lost \nnutrients from the watershed and approximately $31,815 in lost sediment and water capacity. \n \n \n \n \n7-  1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.2    Adaptive Management Process \n \nIn addition to ecosystem-based management, an adaptive management process is being \nused for watershed management in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. Adaptive management is \n“learning by doing” and has become the recommended approach for ecosystem and natural \nresources management, including watershed management (Christensen et al. 1996; Holling 1978; \nJackson et al. 2001). Adaptive management has helped shift management from the concept that \nthere is a “balance of nature” to a more realistic concept that ecosystems are dynamic, \nnon-equilibrium systems. The environment is continually changing climate, development, \nagricultural practices, demographics, and societal values. Adaptive management is the only \nfeasible approach for moving toward sustainable water resources (Coleman 1998). \nAdaptive management, or learning by doing, means that periodic assessments must be \nmade to determine if results-based criteria are being attained and if the water bodies and \nwatershed are moving toward the desired vision for Middle Porter Bayou and its watershed. The \nschedule for these periodic assessments and revision of the watershed management plan is \ndiscussed in Chapters 9 and 10. The rotating basin approach used by MDEQ is part of this \nperiodic assessment process. \n \n \n \n \n7.3    Planned activities \n \nThere are two key factors in this watershed that dictate which BMPs will be successful, \nirrigation and development. With development comes an increased financial investment by the \nlandowner. As land cost increases, landowner willingness to take land out of production to \nimplement BMPs decreases. This scenario calls for larger BMPs to be implemented in \nundeveloped areas that will treat runoff from upstream, developed areas. The less developed \nareas of the watershed are characterized by ridge and swale topography and there are more \nopportunities for BMP implementation. Low-lying swales are suitable for treatment wetlands, while \nunimproved drainage ditches are prime candidates for low grade weirs, tail water recovery \nsystems, and other BMPs. \nIrrigation, particularly of rice, introduces an additional factor into the nutrient equation. \nBase flows in most Delta streams naturally decrease during the summer months due to less \n \n \n \n7-  2\n\n \n \n \n \nrainfall. Irrigation water supplements these base flows and often provides a constant source of \nrunoff throughout the growing season. Although increased base flows benefit many aspects of \nstream health and water quality, it also reduces the ability of some BMPs to trap nutrients. For \nexample, multiple low grade weirs are designed to trap and pool runoff allowing biological \ntransformations to occur. With a steady base flow the utility of these in-stream BMPs is greatly \ndiminished. To effectively treat this type of runoff we must focus on BMPs capable of treating or \nreusing large volumes of water. Therefore, for areas of the watershed characterized by both \ndevelopment and irrigation, tail water recovery systems, on-farm storage reservoirs, and \ntreatment wetlands the primary BMPs will be the limited nutrient data and estimated existing \necoregion concentrations indicate reductions of nutrients can be accomplished with installation \nof best management practices (MDEQ 2008). \nGiven these considerations, the management practices currently targeted for the Middle Porter \nBayou watershed include: \n \n \n• Nutrient and sediment BMPs, \n• Enroll marginal lands in wetland restoration programs, \n• Water management projects, \n• Wildlife management, \n• Point source management, \n• Riparian buffer restoration, and \n• Alligator weed control.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n7-  3 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7.3.1    Nutrient and Sediment BMPs \nMiddle Porter Bayou has been targeted for monitoring and installation of BMPs to reduce \n nutrient and sediment loads in cropland runoff. Specific nutrient and sediment BMPs (Figure 7.1) \n that may be installed in the watershed include: \n \n• Low-grade weirs, \n• Pads and pipes, \n• Irrigation tailwater recovery systems, \n• Irrigation water conveyance pipe, \n• Irrigation land leveling, \n• Water control structures, \n• Two stage ditches, \n• Grassed waterways, \n• Riparian buffers, \n• Input management, and \n• Conservation easements. \n \n \n \nThese BMPs are discussed below. \n \n \n \n7.3.1.1 Low-grade Weirs \n \nInstallation of low-grade weirs in agricultural drainage ditches can improve water quality \nthrough removal of sediment and nutrients. The weirs slow flow during storm events and allow \nsediment to be deposited. In addition, holding water in the ditches behind the weirs creates \nenvironments that encourage biogeochemical transformation of nutrients, and may contribute to \ngroundwater recharge (Kroger et al 2008\na\n). One study in the Delta determined that low-grade \nweirs reduced annual phosphorus loads from cropland runoff by over 40% (Kroger et al. 2008\nb\n). \n   Low-grade weirs will be installed in ditches throughout the watershed as funding allows  \n  through various cost share programs such as EQIP and 319 prograns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  4 \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7.1.

The pad (a dike) routes flow through the pipe to provide an non-erodible \nroute for runoff as an alternative to unlined ditches or gullies. This practice has been classified \nby the Mississippi NRCS as having the potential to decrease sediment loads slightly to significantly.\n7\n  \nThis practice is not expected to significantly affect nutrient loads, except for phosphorus associated  \nwith sediment loads.\n8\n Pad and pipe systems have already been installed in Middle Porter Bayou by  \nsome producers in the watershed. However, there is potential for installation in additional locations \nthroughout the watershed (Figure 7.1). These systems could be designed and installed by the landowner, \nwith assistance from Delta F.A.R.M or NRCS. Financial assistance for installation and maintenance of \nthese systems may be provided by through the EPA and MDEQ Section 319 grant funds, NRCS cost \nshare programs, or privately funded by the landowner or producer. See Table 7.2 for details of the plans \nfor installing these systems. \n \n \n \n7.3.1.3 Irrigation Tailwater Recovery \n \n   Tailwater recovery systems collect irrigation runoff water for reuse. This makes for more \nefficient use of irrigation water. Holding runoff water, such as in a collection pond, allows sediment  \nto settle out, and creates environments that encourage biogeochemical transformation of nutrients, as  \nwell as contribute to groundwater recharge. In addition to water use management and water quality \nimprovement, tailwater recovery ponds can benefit several of the species of concern identified in  \nSection 3.3. Tailwater recovery systems are planned for the watershed and will be installed where \nsuitable. The systems will be designed to recover drainage from cropland in the watershed. Systems may \nbe designed and installed by the landowner with assistance from NRCS and Delta F.A.R.M.  Financial \nassistance for installation of systems may be available from NRCS programs and/or EPA 319 grant \nfunds.

Use of underground pipe can reduce erosion and water loss, \nand improve irrigation water management. Installation of underground irrigation pipe is an \neligible practice for the MRBI CCPI program.  See Table 7.4 for details of the plans for installing \n underground irrigation pipe in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. \n \n \n7.3.1.5 Irrigation Land Leveling \n \nThis practice involves modifying the shape of the land to planned grades that permit \nuniform and efficient application of irrigation water, reduce erosion and water logging, and provide  \nfor adequate drainage.

These lands can reduce erosion through stabilizing soil. Conservation lands can also \nact as filters to remove sediment and nutrients in runoff. Conservation programs generally \nprovide some kind of financial incentive or compensation in return for removing the land from \ncultivation, such as rental payments, cost-share for restoration work, or tax credits. The USDA \nmanages several programs for land conservation in Mississippi, including the Conservation \nReserve Program, and Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Program. The Mississippi Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation also manages a conservation easement program, as do the Mississippi Land Trust and \nDucks Unlimited and Delta Wildlife. \n \n \n7.3.1.9 Riparian Buffers \n \nRiparian buffers help reduce bank erosion, provide and improve wildlife habitat, \nand trap sediment and nutrients from overland runoff to the waterway. Riparian buffers \nalso serve as filter strips removing sediments from agricultural runoff entering the bayou \nthrough overland flow. The NPBDD Stream Bank Restoration Project involves the \nmulching and grinding of woody underbrush along the banks of Porter Bayou. Native \nwarm season grasses have been planted in high topographic areas as a means of bank \nstabilization and herbaceous wetland plants are being managed for in the floodway. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  15\n\n \n \nT\nable 7.7.

Precision agriculture is expected to reduce the amount of inputs \nproducers use, reducing their production costs, and runoff and infiltration of fertilizer \nnutrients and pesticide chemicals. \n   There is currently concern among Delta producers about the high start-up costs of \nprecision agriculture, and the uncertainty about whether the technique actually increases \nproducer profits. There is also uncertainty among producers about how to implement the \ntechniques, and if it is even needed in the Delta. This technique was developed in the upper \nMidwest, which has very different soils and nutrient cycling than the Delta. Table 7.8 contains  \nadditional information. \n \n \n \n7.3.2    Enroll Lands in Wetland Reserve Program \nNatural and constructed wetlands have been shown to improve water quality through \nremoval of sediment and nutrients. Slow flow through the wetlands allows sediments to be \ndeposited. Nutrients are used by wetland plants, and the wet environment encourages \nbiogeochemical transformation of nutrients. In addition, wetlands can be places of groundwater \nrecharge. \nMiddle Porter Bayou Watershed is a target watershed under the MRBI Wetland Reserve \nEnhancement Program (WREP). Approximately 2,092 acres of wetlands currently exist in the \nMiddle Porter Bayou Watershed (Figure 2.2). There are already a few wetland easements in the \nwatershed. Delta Wildlife and Mississippi NRCS will assist with design of constructed wetlands.  \nSee Table 7.9 for additional information about wetland restoration and construction activities planned  \nfor Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  17\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.3.3   Wildlife Management \nProjects will be implemented in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed with the purpose of \nimproving and extending habitat for wildlife, primarily birds. These include restoration, creation, \nand management of wetlands through the Wetland Reserve Program and WREP, and shallow \nwater development and management. Restored and constructed wetlands can provide wintering \nhabitat, migratory stop-over sites, late summer/fall foraging sites, and breeding/nesting habitat \nfor a number of waterfowl, forest, and migratory bird species. Shallow water development and \nmanagement involves inundating fields during the winter to provide habitat for wildlife, \nincluding native and migrating waterfowl, migrating shorebirds, amphibians, and fish. As noted \nin Section 7.3.2, wetland restoration, construction, and management activities in Middle Porter Bayou \nare eligible for assistance under the MRBI. See Table 7.10 for additional information about \nshallow water development planned for Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. \nOther management practices also have the potential to improve or extend habitat for \nwildlife. Tailwater recovery ponds (Section 7.3.1.3) and off-channel storage ponds \n(Section 7.3.5.2) can provide habitat for waterfowl and amphibians. Riparian buffers \n(Section 7.3.1.9) can improve fisheries of the associated waterway, and provide habitat for \nterrestrial wildlife, including birds. \n \n \n \n \n7.3.4   Alligator Weed Control \n \n The existing NPBDD eradication program will be continued as adequate funds are available. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  18 \n\nTable 7\n.8.

Development of off-channel water storage is an eligible \npractice under the MRBI-CCPI, AWEP and EQIP programs. Landowners will design and install off-\nchannel water storage with assistance from NRCS and Delta F.A.R.M. Priority locations for off-channel \nwater storage will be determined based on program prioritization criteria (Section 6.2).

Irrigation \nwater management will be implemented in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed through the \nMRBI CCPI and EQIP program. This may include implementation of the NRCS PHAUCET \nIrrigation Control Program, flow meters, engine timers, and soil moisture monitors. PHAUCET \nhelps producers design flat poly pipe furrow irrigation systems by identifying the appropriate \nhole sizes to punch in the pipe based on variables such as the well pump rate, field slope, row \nlengths, and size of poly pipe (YMD 2009). This design assistance is expected to reduce water \nusage. Feedback from producers who have used PHAUCET has all been positive (YMD 2009). \nSee Table 7.12 for additional information on planned implementation Irrigation Water \nManagement in Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. \n \n \n \n7.3.6    Point Source Management \nThe Shaw POTW will be required to achieve NPDES permit limits for ammonia in its \neffluent by May 2013. As a condition of its NPDES permit, the Shaw POTW was required to \nsubmit an engineering report to MDEQ describing how the facility would come into compliance \nwith the appropriate ammonia limit, by May 2011. Compliance with nutrient permit limits by small . \nPOTWs is expected to be a wide-spread issue in the Delta.  \n \n \n \n \n7.4    Schedule \n \n   A schedule management practice implementation will be developed as funding sources are  \n  secured for plan implementation.

The total budget for all BMPs identified $12,900,100. Note \nthat these estimates are preliminary and may change. Table 7.14 references available programs for \npotential conservation funding.  \n \n \n7.6 Development of Cost Estimates \n   BMP cost estimates were based on averaged actual BMP costs as documented \nthrough past 319 projects and NRCS program contracts. For example, the total project costs of \neight on-farm storage reservoirs were averaged to develop a cost per ac/ft of storage. This cost \nper ac/ft was multiplied times the projected number of ac/feet planned in the watershed. The \nsame approach was utilized for all other BMPs. Total BMP cost was then proportionally \nassigned to funding program or producer based on past experience of integrating the different \nfunding mechanisms in a watershed project. For example, two-stage ditches are not an \napproved EQIP practice in Mississippi, therefore implementation is funded primarily through \n319 while producers are responsible for long term maintenance; land leveling is generally paid \nfor by the producer, NRCS will pay for the pad and 319 will cover the pipe. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-  26\n\n      \n               \n \n                      \n           \n                     \n \n                          \n  \n          \n             \n  \n \n                          \n                     \n             \n \n \n                          \n                           \n \n \n                             \n                             \n  \n                      \n          \n  \n \n                      \n                     \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 7.13.

These stakeholders were also apprised of the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy, and the associated \nwork \nplanned in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed. \n \n8.2.2    Nutrient and Sediment BMPs \nThe data gathered from the monitoring associated with BMP installations in Middle \nPorter Bayou Watershed will be used to inform producers in the area, and the BMP sites will be \nincluded on informative tours for Delta farmers. USGS and MSU will provide data reports to \nDelta F.A.R.M., and Delta F.A.R.M. will disseminate the relevant information to its members. \nAs priority sites are identified for nutrient and sediment BMPs, personnel from Delta F.A.R.M., \nDelta Wildlife, or NRCS will contact producers working land in those catchments to discuss \ninstalling and maintaining BMPs. \n \n8.2.3   PHAUCET \nDelta F.A.R.M. will work with NRCS and partners to educate producers in Porter \nBayou watershed about the PHAUCET program, its benefits and success, and how to implement \nit. \n \n \n \n \n \n8-  3\n\n \n \n \n \n8.2.4    WRP Enrollment \n   The most effective outreach efforts are those that work one on one with individual \nlandowners, which is the process that will be used by both DW and NRCS in implementing \nthe WRP. NRCS will work with individual landowners first, to enroll land in WRP \nand draw up contracts for wetland easements. Once the contracts are signed, DW and NRCS will \ninclude the landowners in designing and constructing the WRP project, to ensure compatibility \nwith farming practices, and provide insight and information on how wetland functions benefit the \nlandowner. Ancillary benefits the landowner receives by having the WRP project on their \nproperty will be described and documented for use in future DW outreach and education. \n   Sustaining both the wetland functions and management activities over time will be \nsignificantly enhanced with three years of individual landowner outreach on wetland \nmanagement. After three years, the wetlands will be established and close to being self- \nsustaining. Further, after 3 years of individual consultation and encouragement, landowner \nmanagement activities are expected to become part of their routine farming practices. \n 8.2.5 Farm Tours \n Farm tours are an important means of educating producers and increasing awareness of \nconservation efforts. Tours will be hosted by Delta F.A.R.M. who will coordinate with project partners to \nensure the desired message is adequately presented. These tours give producers, regulators, educators, and \neven the general public an opportunity to see firsthand how conservation is applied and successful on the \nagricultural landscape of the Mississippi Delta. \n \n8.3   Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy \n \n Ongoing activities implemented through the Delta Nutrient Reduction Strategy are expected to \ncontribute to the awareness, education, and outreach goals of this plan. DNRS work groups routinely meet \nto discuss monitoring, best management practices, water management, input management, etc.  Outcomes \nfrom these meetings are incorporated into education/outreach materials which are disseminated to \nproducers and the general public through multiple outlets. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEducation, Outreach Activity Budget Funding Sources \nBMP Outreach $60,000 \n \nEPA/NRCS \nPHAUCET outreach $15,000 MSU/Delta F.A.R.M. \nNutrient Reduction strategy \n \n$30,000 \nEPA/MDEQ/Delta F.A.R.M. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.4    Schedule \n \nActivities geared toward increasing awareness, outreach, and education will occur \nthroughout the process of contracting, designing, installing, maintaining, and documenting \nmanagement practices in the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed.

Current efforts  \nby MDEQ, USGS, and MSU are monitoring flow, sediment, N, and P, and other constituents during  \nboth base flow and storm flow, prior to, and after, construction and implementation of conservation \nmanagement practices to determine the resulting percent reduction in sediment, N, and P at the multiple  \nspatial tiers.  However, funding for these efforts is set to expire in 2014. See Figure 7.1 for monitoring \nlocations. \n \n \n \n9.1.2    Habitat \n WRP Easement properties in the watershed are monitored by NRCS or a technical service \n provider such as Delta Wildlife.

YMD surveys water levels in 550 wells throughout the Delta every year in the spring \nand fall (YMD 2008). There are no USGS continuous ground water monitoring wells located in \nthe Middle Porter Bayou Watershed.\n9 \nSurface water levels do not appear to be routinely monitored at any water body in the \nMiddle Porter Bayou Watershed. Water levels in the Sunflower River are monitored by a USGS gage \nupstream of Middle Porter Bayou, at Sunflower.10 \n \n \n \n9.1.4    Water Use Survey \nYMD conducts an annual water use survey for the five major crop types in the Delta – \ncorn, cotton, soybeans, rice, and catfish. Between 100 and 150 sites are surveyed each year. \nIrrigation water volumes are estimated based on pump flow rate and monthly electricity usage. \n \n \n \n9.1.5    Schedule \n  The schedule for monitoring activities well be developed as funding sources are made available. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________________________________ \n9\n http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ms/nwis/gw \n10 http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ms/nwis/dv/?site_no=07288500&amp;referred_module=sw \n \n \n \n9-  2\n\nMonitoring Activity Budget Funding Source \nWater quality (tier 2) \n$180,000 (3 years) \nEPA/DEQ/USGS \nWater quality (tier 1) $105,000 (3 years) EPA/DEQ/MSU \nWetland habitat agency budgets NRCS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9.1.6    Budget \nBudget information for monitoring activities is summarized in Table 9.2. \n \n \n  Table 9.1.

The nutrient TMDL completed for Porter Bayou used preliminary annual average \nconcentration targets of 1.05 mg/l for TN and 0.16 mg/l for TP (MDEQ 2008).\n The management \ntargets for this plan are 40% reduction of TN load to Middle Porter Bayou, and 50% reduction of the                \nTP load to Middle Porter Bayou. \n \n \n9.2.2    Sediment \nSimon et al (2000) developed acceptable ranges of sediment loadings at the effective \ndischarge of Mississippi water bodies from suspended sediment concentration (SSC) data \nmeasured at stable streams in the same ecoregion. The effective discharge is the discharge which \nmoves the most sediment, or is the channel-forming flow. The target range for the water bodies \nwithin the Yazoo River basin (which includes Middle Porter Bayou) is 0.0014 to 0.0045 tons per acre \nper day at the effective discharge.  \n \n \n9.2.3 Groundwater \n \nFor activities focused on reducing groundwater use, the management target is to reduce \ngroundwater use by 40 acre-feet per year at the site of implementation. Restoration of wetlands \nalso has a target of increasing the area available for groundwater recharge in the Middle Porter Bayou \nwatershed by 3 ac/ft. \n \n9.3    Assessment \n \nImplementation milestones and schedules have been developed for the management \nactions and education and outreach activities described in this plan. For implementation to be \nconsidered successful, all activity milestones must be met on time. The team will meet quarterly \nto review progress on achieving the milestones and make needed adjustments to the schedule. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9-  4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach team member serves as the chair for one of the major management categories, such as \nsewerage, sediment and nutrient loading, etc. There is a subcommittee associated with each of \nthese categories to ensure that the management actions are implemented. \nIn addition, the success of the implementation of this plan in achieving the management \ntargets specified in Section 9.2, will be evaluated no later than 2015. This will be accomplished \nby the Watershed Implementation Team, or its designee(s), compiling and renewing available \nmonitoring data (Section 9.1) and comparing results to the targets. A short report will be \nprepared by the evaluators, summarizing the results of their review. This information will be \nprovided to all interested stakeholders and implementation participants in preparation for \nrevising the Middle Porter Bayou Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). \n \n \n \n9.3.1    Plan \nSpecific management action schedules toward achieving the vision for the Middle Porter Bayou \nwatershed are described in Chapter 7.0 and summarized in Table 7.14. If the schedules are not \nbeing met, the causes behind the failure to meet the goals will be determined, and actions will be \ntaken. Specific management action goals and/or expectations are described in Chapter 7.0. \n \n \n \n9.3.2    Education and outreach \nSpecific goals and/or expectations for education and outreach activities are described in \nChapter 8.0. If the activity goals were not met, the causes behind the failure to meet the goals \nwill be determined. In addition, the plan activities will be evaluated with regard to information \nand knowledge about the watershed and its water bodies that has been gained since the existing \nplan was developed, as well as any relevant physical changes in the watershed or changes in \npolicy affecting the watershed. Implementation of the activities will be reevaluated in light of all \nof this information on a quarterly basis, as discussed above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9-  5 \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n                                                                      10.0 OVERALL BUDGET \n \nTable 10.1 Watershed Implementation Plan Budget \nActivity NRCS EPA 319 Producer Other Total \nBMPs \n $  4,627,175  $  4,104,800  $  4,258,125   $           -    \n $  12,900,100 \nMonitoring \n $                 -     $        195,000   $                 -     $  90,000  \n $     285,000  \nOutreach \n $        30,000   $        45,000   $                 -     $  30,000  \n $     105,000  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n            10-1 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11.0 PLAN REVISION \n \n   Dependent on approval and funding, the Watershed Implementation Team will prepare a \n revised WIP, incorporating the changes requested by the reviewers and reconciling any conflicting \ncomments or requests for change. \n   The WIP will be submitted to the Watershed Implementation Team and all others \nwho submitted comments.
