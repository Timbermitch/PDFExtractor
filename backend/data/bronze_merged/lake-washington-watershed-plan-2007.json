However, \nLake Washington has been plagued by water quality problems for decades, some of which \naffected the sport fishery (i.e., pesticides and low dissolved oxygen (DO)). In 1996, Lake \nWashington was placed on the Mississippi list of impaired waters under the Clean Water Act. \nIn 2004, a Lake Washington Watershed Implementation Team (Team) was formed to address the \nwater quality issues in Lake Washington and its watershed. The Team includes local landowners \nand representatives from state and county agencies. The Team consulted with Lake Washington \nstakeholders to determine their concerns about Lake Washington and then developed this plan of \nactivities to address a number of these stakeholder concerns along with regulatory water quality \nproblems. \nPlans for addressing the following concerns about Lake Washington are described in this \nWatershed Implementation Plan: \n \n1. Lake Washington fishery health, \n2. Damage to shoreline cypress forest from large flocks of roosting cormorants, \n3. Raw sewage in Lake Washington, \n4.         Nuisance         alligators,         \n5. Non-attainment of applicable state water quality standards, \n6. High levels of nutrients in Lake Washington, and \n7.         Fish         kills.         \n \nOther concerns will be addressed in later revisions to the Watershed Implementation \nPlan. Table ES.1 summarizes the activities planned to address the concerns above. \n \n\nTable ES.1 Summary of management \naction schedules and milestones. \n \nManagement \nAction \nMilestones \nSchedule \nResponsibility \nDate Achieved \nRegional sewer \nsystem \n1.

oxbow lake that provides a pleasant and safe place to live, fish, \nboat, and swim. Its natural shoreline has a healthy cypress forest and low intensity development. \nIt contains a healthy, balanced sport fishery that attracts non-local anglers who contribute to the \nlocal economy. Lake Washington is free from the occurrence of bank erosion, nuisance algal \nblooms and aquatic plants, fish kills, and sewerage. Lake Washington, and all waterbodies in the \nwatershed, meet state water quality standards. Management of agricultural, recreational, \nresidential, business, and other interests in the watershed complement each other and contribute \nto economic sustainability and improved quality of life in the watershed. \n \n1.2      Mission      Statement      \nThe mission of the Lake Washington Watershed Implementation Team and this \nImplementation Plan is to improve and maintain Lake Washington as a beautiful resource \nthrough better environmental stewardship, including conservation and restoration practices to \nensure that the forestry, water quality, and water quantity in the watershed are balanced. \n \n1.3 Lake Washington Watershed Implementation Team \nTable 1.1 lists the members of the Lake Washington Watershed Implementation Team, \nalong with their affiliations and contact information. \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n1-2 \nTable 1.1.

Its watershed is approximately 29,500 acres (Figure 2.1). \nThe watershed is located in the Mississippi Alluvial Plains ecoregion, and is underlain by \nMississippi River Alluvium (Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) 2000). \nNative vegetation in the watershed is bottomland hardwood forest consisting of oak, gum, \ncottonwood, and cypress (MARIS online mapping accessed July 15, 2004). The topography of \nthe watershed is relatively flat, with a maximum elevation variation of about 30 ft. There are \nthree major soil associations present in the watershed (see Table 2.1, Figure 2.2). \n \nTable 2.1. Major soil associations in Lake Washington watershed. \n \nSoil Association \nArea \n(acres) \nCharacteristics \n(USDA 1958) \nCommerce-Robinsonville-Crevasse           6,284           \nThis association consists of nearly level soils \nformed on Mississippi River alluvium with drainage \nproperties that range from somewhat poorly drained \nto excessively drained. Where these soils are \nsomewhat poorly to well drained, they are among \nthe best in the county for agriculture.  \nSharkey-Tunica-Dundee                             6,086                             \nThis association consists of level to sloping soils \nthat formed on fine-textured Mississippi River \nalluvium and slack-water sediments. The soil \ndrainage properties range from poorly drained \nclayey soils to moderately well drained. Those areas \nwith slightly higher elevation or moderate drainage \nare well suited to agricultural use. \nDundee-Askew-Sharkey                            12,782                            \nThis association consists of level to nearly level \nsoils that formed on fine-textured Mississippi River \nalluvium and slack-water sediments. The soil \ndrainage properties range from poorly drained \nclayey soils to moderately well drained. Those areas \nwith moderate drainage are well suited to \nagricultural use. \n \n\n \n \n \n2-2 \nFigure 2.1. Lake Washington watershed. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n2-3 \nFigure 2.2. Soil associations and location within the watershed. \n \n \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n2-4 \n2.2      Land      Use      \nIn 2001 land use in the watershed was primarily agricultural, with 69% of the watershed \nin crop production, and 16% in wetlands (Figure 2.3). Corn has replaced cotton as the major crop \nin the watershed. Other crops cultivated in the watershed include soybeans, sorghum, snap beans, \nsmall grains, rice, wheat, and sunflowers (Tetra Tech 2003). The areas of land uses are \nsummarized in Table 2.2 and shown on Figure 2.3. There are no public lands in the watershed. \nThe catfish ponds that existed in 1993 have been converted to cropland. Other land use \nchanges that are occurring in the watershed include conversion of pasture as the local \ncommunities are expanding, and redevelopment of lakeshore lots on Lake Washington. \n \nTable 2.2.

The eastern border \nof the watershed is a Mississippi River levee, so there is no longer a direct hydrologic connection \nbetween the Mississippi River and the watershed (Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, \nand Parks (MDWFP) 2005a). The watershed is a complex network of natural levees, ditches, \nslackwater areas, and shallow depressions that p\n\narallel the meander belt of the old Mississippi \nRiver channel (FTN Associates, Ltd. (FTN) 1991). Wetlands are associated with many water \nfeatures in the watershed (see Figure 2.3).\n\n \n \n \n2-5 \nFigure 2.3. Lake Washington watershed land use and land cover. \n \n \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n2-6 \nLake Washington is the largest waterbody in the watershed (Table 2.3). It receives \ndrainage from a number of ditches, including several connected to Lake Britton and Lake \nJackson, located west of Lake Washington in the watershed (Figure 2.3). Water from Lake \nWashington drains to Washington Bayou, a tributary of Steele Bayou. At the outlet to \nWashington Bayou is a low head dam that elevates Lake Washington water level 4 ft. The \nwatershed is underlain by the Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer. Groundwater from this aquifer \nis used by watershed inhabitants (Tetra Tech 2003). \n \nTable 2.3. Morphometric characteristics of Lake Washington. \n \nParameter Lake Washington \nVolume                                                         2.13                                                         x                                                         10\n7 \nm\n3 \n(17,266 ac-ft) \nSurface Area 1,188 ha (2,935 acres) \nMean Depth 1.8 m (5.9 ft) \nMaximum Depth 6 m (19.7 ft) \nResidence Time 150 days \n \n2.4      Socioeconomics      \nThe Lake Washington watershed is primarily a rural area (Tetra Tech 2003, \nhttp://www.census.gov\n). We estimate that approximately 400 people lived in this watershed in \n2000 (based on Census 2000 census block data for Washington and Issaquena counties). The \ntowns of Chatham, Glen Allan, and Erwin are in the Lake Washington watershed. Other \ncommunities in the watershed include Foote, Leota, Byrne City, and Alhambra \n(http://www.mapquest.com; accessed April 14, 2006). The watershed is located less than \n20 miles from Greenville and could be influenced by growth in that community. Median \nhousehold income in the Lake Washington watershed in 1999 was around $25,000. \nApproximately 28% to 36% of the population in the watershed had income below the poverty \nlevel in 1999 (http://www.census.gov\n). \nLake Washington contributes to the area economy primarily through recreation. \nRecreational visitors contribute to the local economy through spending for lodging, food, \nsporting goods (there are four bait and tackle shops in the watershed), and boats (there are six \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n2-7 \nprivate boat ramps open to the public for a fee and one marina). The lake is known for its sport \nfishing. A study conducted by MDWFP found that the lake draws anglers from over 400 miles \naway (http://www.outfitters.org/fishing/lakes/washington.pdf\n). Crop and livestock agriculture \nand aquaculture in the watershed also contribute to the area economy. \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n3-1 \n3.0 STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS \n \nLake Washington stakeholders include people who live in the watershed year-round, \nincluding both property owners and renters. Some stakeholders live on the lakeshore. Other \nstakeholders include vacation property owners who have primary residences outside of the Lake \nWashington watershed, local farmers (those who own land and those who don’t), absentee \nfarmland owners, and local business owners. In addition, there are a significant number of \nstakeholders who don’t own land or businesses in the watershed but visit Lake Washington for \nrecreational purposes (e.g., fishing). The majority of all of these stakeholders value Lake \nWashington for its recreational opportunities (fishing, boating, swimming, and hunting) and \naesthetics. Land-based interests in the watershed include farming and hunting. \nIn 2003, the Lake Washington Property Owners Association began working with MDEQ, \ncounty government, and other agencies and organizations to address their concerns about the \ncondition of Lake Washington. Issues identified by stakeholders are summarized in Table 3.1 \nand discussed below. \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n3-2 \nTable 3.1.

During July 2004, the Mississippi State \nDepartment of Health (MSDH) conducted a field survey to identify onsite wastewater systems \n(i.e., septic systems) that might be malfunctioning. At the same time, MDEQ conducted an \nintensive water quality survey to check fecal coliform bacteria levels. MSDH did identify three \nmalfunctioning onsite wastewater systems during the field survey. The MDEQ water quality \nsurvey did not find fecal coliform levels above the water quality standard. Overall, this work was \ninconclusive in identifying the source of sewage observed by lakeshore property owners. The \nLake Washington watershed team is working toward eliminating wastewater discharges to Lake \nWashington by promoting sewering of the lakeshore properties. In the meantime, lakeshore \nproperty values are increasing and redevelopment of lakeshore camps, which often have \nquestionable wastewater treatment systems, is expected. Since all new construction requires \ninstallation of wastewater treatment systems that meet MSDH health codes, redevelopment of \nthe camps would reduce the likelihood of a discharge of improperly treated sewage to Lake \nWashington from shore properties. \n \n3.2      Sediment      \nLake Washington is a turbid lake. The median Secchi disk depth (a measure of water \nclarity) during the 2002-2004 MDEQ nutrient monitoring study on Lake Washington was \n0.3 meter (about 1 ft). High turbidities in Lake Washington are believed to be the result of high \nloads of sediment being washed into the lake from the watershed, from bank erosion and \nslumping, and from head-cutting of streams and ditches from failing road culverts. Turbidity and \nhigh sediment loads can be problematic for fish and other aquatic organisms, as well as anglers, \ncan result in premature “aging” (i.e., filling-in) of lakes, and can affect the aesthetic appeal of the \nlake. \nDuring 1991 and 1992, a Section 319 project was facilitated by MDEQ’s Nonpoint \nSource Pollution Program that was designed to demonstrate and assess non-structural and \nstructural practices to reduce sediment and nutrient concentrations in Lake Washington. The \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n3-4 \nproject focused primarily on non-structural methods (no-till cotton, soybeans, and corn; \nreduced-till cotton, soybeans, and corn; and winter cover crops), but included installation of \ngrade stabilization structures. These practices did make a measurable difference in the sediment \nloading to Lake Washington. When economic incentives for these practices were discontinued \nhowever, some of them were not maintained, and became less effective \n(http://www.epa.gov/gmpo/lmrsbc/meetsum_lakewa_oct03.html\n). \nIn 1996 and 2004, waterbodies in the Lake Washington watershed were classified as \nimpaired due to high turbidity levels and sediment loads and included on the Mississippi 303(d) \nlist of impaired waterbodies (see Section 5.4.2). Total maximum daily load (TMDLs) studies \naddressing the 1996 303(d) listings were completed for those waterbodies in 2003 (see \nSection 5.4.3 for detailed summaries of these TMDLs). Those TMDLs set goals for reducing \ninputs of sediment to waterbodies in the watershed (Tetra Tech 2003). The Clean Water Act \nrequires that management activities to achieve these goals be implemented in the Lake \nWashington watershed. \n \n3.3 Nutrients and Low Dissolved Oxygen/Organic Enrichment \nHistorical problems with nuisance algal blooms at Lake Washington are believed to be \nthe result of high nutrient concentrations in the lake. In turn, these algal blooms cause low \ndissolved oxygen (DO) conditions when they die and decompose. When the DO levels become \nlow enough, fish kills can occur. \nFilter strips, grassed waterways, and dropped inlet structures were installed in the Lake \nWashington watershed with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 319 \nfunds in the late 1980s and early 1990s to reduce sediment and nutrient concentrations in Lake \nWashington (see Section 2.3.2). Results of a follow-up study in 1996 showed that excessive algal \nblooms continued to present problems in Lake Washington, and that conditions in the lake were \nessentially the same as those observed in the 1991 study, with no improvements in chlorophyll a, \nSecchi readings, or nutrient concentrations. Recent monitoring results have also indicated high \nnutrient levels and low DO levels \n(http://www.epa.gov/gmpo/lmrsbc/meetsum_lakewa_oct03.html\n). \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n3-5 \nLake Washington has been classified as the second most eutrophic lake in Mississippi \n(eutrophic condition is linked to nutrient levels). In 1996 and 2004, waterbodies in the Lake \nWashington watershed were classified as impaired due to high nutrient levels, low DO levels, \nand organic enrichment, and were included on the Mississippi 303(d) list of impaired \nwaterbodies (see Section 4.5.2). TMDL studies addressing the 1996 listings were completed \nin 2003 (see Section 4.5.3 for detailed summaries of these TMDLs). The TMDLs set goals for \nreducing inputs of nutrients and organic materials (i.e., oxygen demand) to waterbodies in the \nwatershed (Tetra Tech 2003). The Clean Water Act requires that management activities to \nachieve these goals be implemented in the Lake Washington watershed. \nIn recent years, cormorant populations in the watershed have increased dramatically from \na few hundred to over 13,000 (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife \nServices aerial survey). This increase has been attributed to the development of catfish ponds in \nthe region. Cormorants roosting around the lake have also contributed to cypress tree damage \nand increased nutrient concentrations through their droppings. \nIn 2003 a nutrient showcase project was initiated for Lake Washington under the Action \nPlan for Reducing, Mitigating, and Controlling Hypoxia in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. The \nproject involves: \n \n• Identification and assessment of sources of nitrogen loads in the watershed, \n• Identification of widely available, cost-effective best management \npractices (BMPs) appropriate for the nitrogen sources in the watershed, and \n• Assessment of site-specific nutrient load reductions resulting from \nimplementation of one or more of the identified BMPs \n(http://www.epa.gov/gmpo/lmrsbc/meetsum_lakewa_oct03.html\n). \n \n3.4      Fishery      Condition      \nIn recent years stakeholders have commented that fewer bass and crappie were being \ncaught in Lake Washington than previously. Reduced likelihood of catching bass and crappie in \nLake Washington could make the lake less appealing to recreational anglers, reducing the \nnumber of visitors and potentially negatively impacting the local economy. MDWFP fish \nsurveys on Lake Washington indicate that gamefish populations have been declining since \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n3-6 \nabout 1999 and that the catfish, drum, and shad populations have increased (MDWFP 2005a). \nThe MDWFP assessment was that the fishery had become unbalanced (Garry Lucas, MDWFP, \npersonal communication February 14, 2006). \nThere is no consensus on the cause of this imbalance. Some stakeholders believe that \nover-fishing is the cause and have proposed eliminating commercial fish harvesting, and \nprohibiting the use of some fishing gear, such as yo-yos. Researchers at MDWFP suspect that \ncatfish are impacting the survival of gamefish fry and believe the best course is to continue to \nencourage catfish harvest (MDWFP 2005a). \nMDWFP has developed a management plan for Lake Washington, and has already \ninstituted several measures geared toward reducing catfish and shad and increasing crappie and \nbass in Lake Washington. A program that offered prizes from a local store for catching tagged \ncatfish during 2005 was geared toward promoting increased catfish harvest on Lake Washington. \nIncreasing the size restriction for crappie caught on the lake in 2005 was geared toward \nincreasing the crappie in the lake, as are regulations recently adopted to more closely control \nyo-yo fishing for crappie on Lake Washington. MDWFP also has an active bass stocking \nprogram at Lake Washington. With a new north Mississippi hatchery, there should soon be the \nability to also stock crappie. They also stock hybrid striped bass at Lake Washington to help \ncontrol shad (MDWFP 2005a). \nThere is concern that large flocks of migratory cormorants and white pelicans that are \npresent on Lake Washington during the fall and winter could be contributing to the reduced sport \nfishery. Cormorants reportedly consume approximately 0.5 pound of fish per day, per bird, while \npelicans reportedly consume approximately 2 pounds of fish per day, per bird. Prior to 2005, \ncormorant flocks of over 10,000 birds were commonly measured on Lake Washington during the \nwinter. \n \n3.5 Pesticides in Fish \nAll of the waterbodies in the Mississippi Delta, including those in the Lake Washington \nwatershed, were placed under a fish consumption advisory for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane \n(DDT) and toxaphene in carp, buffalo, gar, and catfish larger than 22 inches in 2001. TMDLs \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n3-7 \naddressing pesticide contamination of fish in the Yazoo River Basin (which included the Lake \nWashington watershed) were completed in 2003 and 2005 (see Section 4.5.3 for detailed \nsummaries of these TMDLs). These TMDLs noted that DDT and toxaphene are no longer in use, \nso it isn’t really possible to further reduce loadings of these pollutants, but that fish tissue DDT \nand toxaphene levels exhibited decreasing trends in the Mississippi Delta, suggesting that \nbanning these pesticides has had the desired effect and the natural systems are recovering \n(Figure 3.1). Therefore, the TMDLs recommend monitoring of fish tissue pesticide \nconcentrations until the fish consumption advisories can be canceled (MDEQ 2003, 2005b). \nMDWFP and Wildlife Conservation monitor pesticide levels in fish in Lake Washington \n(MDEQ 2003). In addition, Delta State University personnel are currently analyzing fish tissue \npesticide concentrations in Lake Washington. \n \n3.6      Fish      Kills      \nHistorically, fish kills have occurred almost annually at Lake Washington \n(MDWFP 2005a). The most recent major fish kill occurred in 2004. These fish kills likely were \nthe result of low DO levels that occurred after algal blooms. Implementing the nutrient reduction \ngoals identified in the nutrient TMDL discussed above is expected to reduce the occurrence of \nalgal blooms and associated fish kills in Lake Washington. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n3-8 \nFigure 3.1. Historical trends in fish tissue pesticide residues for toxaphene and DDT. \n \n \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n3-9 \n3.7 Destruction of Lakeshore Forests \nThe cypress forest surrounding Lake Washington is the largest stand of bald cypress in \nthe Delta. This unique natural feature of the watershed is threatened by cormorants and lakeshore \nproperty owners. \nWhile cormorants are native to the area, the population exploded when catfish farming \nwas introduced to the Mississippi Delta. Cormorants exploited the catfish ponds as an easy food \nsource, and their numbers increased dramatically. The large migratory population of cormorants \non Lake Washington has caused visible damage to the l\n\nakeshore cypress forest (USDA Wildlife \nservices estimates that during the fall and winter of 2000, approximately 13,000 cormorants were \nroosting on Lake Washington). The droppings produced by this large population of birds have \nkilled cypress trees along the lakeshore. Starting in the fall of 2000, lakeshore landowners, \nUSDA Wildlife Services, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and MDWFP have been working to \ndiscourage the cormorants from roosting at Lake Washington. This effort, which has been fairly \nsuccessful, is centered on a program that uses pyrotechnics launched from boats and lakeshore \npiers to frighten the birds off the lake when they congregate in large flocks. \nThere is some concern that migratory flocks of pelicans that use Lake Washington could \nalso eventually become large enough to significantly contribute to nutrient problems and \npossibly affect the lake fishery. \n \n3.8 Lake Water Level \nLake Washington is subject to significant evaporation during the summer months, \nresulting in lowering of the lake water level. At times and in places, Lake Washington becomes \nshallow enough that it is difficult to use boat ramps, with exposed stumps creating additional \nboating hazards. Water level fluctuations also promote bank erosion and slumping. Lake \nWashington does have a control structure at its outlet, which is operated by Washington County. \nSeveral possibilities for raising summer lake levels have been suggested, but no course of action \nhas been decided. It is possible that the spillway elevation could be raised in conjunction with \nrepairs to the outlet conduits that are being planned (the outlet conduits have rusted and are in \nneed of repair). \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n3-10 \n3.9 Aquifer Water Levels \nThe majority of drinking, irrigation, and agriculture water use in this watershed is \nsupplied by groundwater from the alluvial aquifer (MDEQ 2000). Heavy agricultural \ngroundwater usage has resulted in the lowering of the groundwater table throughout the Yazoo \nRiver Basin (MDEQ 2000). The Yazoo Mississippi Delta (YMD) Joint Water Management \nDistrict conducts groundwater level surveys in the Yazoo River Basin in the spring and fall, \nwhich include monitoring wells near the Lake Washington watershed. According to the most \nrecent survey report (YMD 2005), between 2003 and 2004, fall groundwater levels in the Lake \nWashington watershed increased 1.0 to 1.5 ft, while spring groundwater levels decreased \nbetween 0.5 and 1.0 ft. This report also indicates that over the last 10 years spring water levels in \nthe watershed have dropped over 2.5 ft, while fall water levels have declined somewhere \nbetween 0.0 and 1.0 ft (YMD 2005). Water conservation BMPs have been implemented by some \nfarmers in the watershed. \n \n3.10    Aquatic    Vegetation    \nCutgrass has moved into shallow areas. While cutgrass helps stabilize the shoreline, it \ndecreases the ability for fishers to fish in shallow waters. In addition, cutgrass can become so \ninvasive, it eliminates other shoreline plant species. Water hyacinth, although not currently \npresent in Lake Washington, does pose a threat. It is abundant in Steel Bayou at the outlet of \nWashington Bayou. \n \n3.11    Alligators    \nAlligators have reached nuisance levels in some areas of Lake Washington. In at least \none instance, there is some indication that the dumping of fish processing waste from a \ncommercial fishing operation is attracting alligators. \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n4-1 \n4.0 WATER RESOURCES \n \n4.1      Historical      Management      \n4.1.1   History of the Lake Washington Watershed Implementation Plan \nWater quality concerns at Lake Washington were raised at least as early as the 1970s, \nwhen Lake Washington was closed to commercial fishing due to pesticide contamination of fish \nin the lake. Several fish kills and algal blooms have been documented at Lake Washington since \nthe mid 1980s. Lake studies in the 1990s attributed these problems to high nutrient levels in Lake \nWashington from runoff from agricultural land in the watershed. During the period from 1991 to \n1992, MDEQ worked with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to implement \nagricultural management practices to reduce nutrient inputs to Lake Washington. A 1996 study \nof Lake Washington, after implementation of the management practices, did not find any \nindication that these practices had reduced nutrient levels in the lake. That same year, Lake \nWashington and two of its tributaries were identified as having impaired water quality and were \nslated for TMDL studies. \nIn 1998, MDEQ implemented the Basin Management Approach (BMA) to water quality \nto carry out the mandates of the Clean Water Act. The intention of BMA was to bring together \nstate, federal, and local agencies to improve and maintain the quality of Mississippi’s water \nresources on a basin scale through comprehensive, long-range water quality planning and \nmanagement strategies. The nine major river watersheds in Mississippi were combined into five \nbasin groups that form the basis for the BMA (Figure 4.1). The BMA is based on a 5-year \nmanagement cycle, with each year dedicated to a different management activity in each basin \ngroup (Figure 4.2). \n \n\n \n \n \n4-2 \nFigure 4.1. MDEQ Basin Management Approach. \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n4-3 \nFigure 4.2. Mississippi basin management cycle. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLake Washington is located in the Yazoo Basin Group, or Basin Group II, which began \nBMA activities in 1999. A basin management plan was developed for Basin Group II in 2004 by \nthe Yazoo Basin Team. Table 4.1 lists the agencies and groups involved in Basin Group II. \n \nTable 4.1. Yazoo Basin (Basin Group II) Team Members. \n \nNatural Resources Conservation Service Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission \nU.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Mississippi State Department of Health \nDelta F.A.R.M. \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District \nU.S. Geological Survey \nYazoo Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District \nMississippi Farm Bureau \nThe Nature Conservancy \nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality \n• Field Services Division \n• Office of Land and Water Resources \n• Total Maximum Daily Load Program \n• Nonpoint Source Program \n• State Revolving Fund \n• Drinking Water Systems Improvements \nRevolving Loan Program \nMississippi Farm Services Agency \nMississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks \nU.S. Department of Agriculture \n Cooperative Extension Service \nDucks Unlimited \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n4-4 \nAs part of the Basin Group II management planning activities of 2004, 15 watersheds \nwithin Basin Group II were identified as priority watersheds for development of watershed \nmanagement plans and implementation of restoration activities. Lake Washington watershed was \none of these priority watersheds. A ranking system was used to select watersheds for \nimplementation. \nThe first step in the ranking process was to calculate prioritization scores for waterbodies. \nIn this first round of ranking, only waterbodies for which TMDLs had been completed were \nprioritized. The prioritization score was based on evaluation of the water quality data available \nfor the waterbody, the method used to develop the TMDL, and the resource value of the \nwaterbody based on its designated uses and the presence of threatened or endangered species. \nThe waterbody scores were then aggregated into watershed scores. Eight-digit hydrologic unit \ncodes were used to define watersheds in the Delta portion of the basin group, and 10-digit \nhydrologic unit codes were used to define watersheds in the Bluff Hills (MDEQ 2004). \nThe second step in the ranking process was to calculate a targeting score for each \nwatershed. The targeting score was based on 1) evaluation of local and agency support for \nrestoration projects in the watershed; 2) restoration and conservation projects that were active, \nplanned, or had been completed in the watershed; and 3) the value of waterbodies in the \nwatershed with regard to quality of life issues such as recreation and aesthetics (MDEQ 2004). \nThe prioritization scores and targeting scores for the watersheds were combined in the \nfinal ranking score. At a Basin Team meeting in July 2004, the team designated approximately \n15 of the highest ranked watersheds as high priority watersheds for restoration and development \nof Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs). \nAgencies and groups involved in the Basin Group II Team committed to target these \npriority watersheds for restoration and management activities and funding. Representatives of \nthese groups also committed to serve on Watershed Implementation Teams for each priority \nwatershed, to develop goals for the watersheds with local stakeholder inputs, develop \ncomprehensive plans for activities to achieve the watershed goals, coordinate implementation of \nactivities in these watersheds, and track progress toward the watershed goals. The intention of \nthe BMA is that watershed restoration through Watershed Implementation Teams and Plans be \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n4-5 \nlocally driven. Members of the Lake Washington implementation team involved in developing \nthe 2006 Lake Washington Implementation Plan are listed in Table 1.1. \nJust prior to the year the Basin Group II Team was involved in their management \nplanning, Lake Washington became a focus of federal and local interest. In 2003 a nutrient \nshowcase project was initiated for Lake Washington under the federal Action Plan for Reducing, \nMitigating, and Controlling Hypoxia in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (http://www.epa.gov/gmpo\n \n/lmrsbc). During this same period, at the local level, the Lake Washington Property Owners \nAssociation contacted MDEQ about water quality concerns, sewage discharge to Lake \nWashington, and cormorant and commercial fishing issue at Lake Washington. In addition, \nin 2003, the Washington County Board of Supervisors also contacted MDEQ about sewage \ndischarge at Lake Washington. Local and federal interest in Lake Washington restoration \ncontributed to the ranking of the Lake Washington watershed as a priority watershed by the \nBasin Group II Management Team. \n \n4.2      Water      Quantity      \nThe majority of drinking, irrigation, and agricultural water use in this watershed is \nsupplied by groundwater from the Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer (MDEQ 2000). There is \nonly one farm that uses water from Lake Washington to supply part of its irrigation water needs. \nThe high carbonate levels in the groundwater makes it marginally suitable for drinking water, but \nsuitable for agricultural uses. Nutrient levels in the groundwater are low, and nitrate levels are \nbelow the USEPA drinking water standard (Tetra Tech 2003). Heavy agricultural groundwater \nusage has resulted in the lowering of water levels in aquifers throughout the Yazoo River Basin \n(MDEQ 2000). Long-term recorded water levels in alluvial aquifer monitoring wells in the Lake \nWashington watershed do not exhibit downward trends (http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov\n). \nSemi-annual water level surveys conducted and analyzed by YMD Joint Water Management \nDistrict, however, indicated a long-term decline in spring groundwater levels of approximately \n2.5 ft in the Lake Washington watershed (YMD 2005). \nWashington County manages the low head dam that regulates water levels in Lake \nWashington. Water is released from two drain culverts in the dam to control lake water levels. \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n4-6 \nThe culverts are used primarily to lower the lake level during high water conditions resulting \nfrom heavy rains (MDWFP 2005a). Lake Washington is subject to significant evaporation in the \nsummer months, which increases the number of shallow areas in the lake. These shallow areas \nare subject to more wind mixing and wave action, which can increase water column temperatures \nand cause bottom sediments to be suspended in the water column, increasing turbidity and \nreleasing nutrients and other chemicals stored in sediments. \n \n4.3      Water      Conservation      \nGroundwater conservation BMPs have been implemented by some farmers in the \nwatershed. \n \n4.4      Wildlife      Resources      \nThe Mississippi Natural Heritage Inventory (http://www.mdwfp.com/museum/html/\n \nresearch/nhp.html) indicates that one federally listed endangered species, Florida panther (Puma \nconcolor coryi), and one federally listed threatened species, Louisiana black bear (Ursus \namericanus luteolus), could be present in Washington County. These species have been \nidentified as species of greatest conservation need in Mississippi (MDWFP 2005b). The Natural \nHeritage Inventory also lists six animal and 12 plant species of “special concern” for Washington \nand Issaquena counties that could potentially be present in the Lake Washington watershed \n(Tables 4.2 and 4.3). In addition, American white pelicans, which have been identified as a \nspecies of greatest conservation need in Mississippi (MDWFP 2005b), are seen in the Lake \nWashington watershed during their migrations through the area (Figure 4.3). \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n4-7 \nTable 4.2.

The American white \npelicans mentioned above are one such species. Cormorants are another migratory species that \nuse Lake Washington. Cormorants roost at Lake Washington in such large numbers that they are \nviewed as a nuisance by locals (see Section 2.3.6). Several species of ducks, including mallards, \nalso use Lake Washington. During the December 2005 waterfowl survey, the Lake Washington \nwatershed was characterized as an area of low duck density (http://www.mdwfp.com/Level2/\n \nWildlife/hunting_waterfowl_survey.asp\n, http://www.mdwfp.com/Level2/Wildlife/ \nregion_waterfowl_reports.asp). \nLake Washington is known for its crappie, bluegill, and catfish fisheries. However, in \nrecent years, these fisheries have been declining, and recreational anglers have been catching \nfewer of these fish. At the same time, the catfish and shad populations seem to be increasing, \nleading researchers to conclude that the fishery has become unbalanced. In addition, there is a \nhistory of fish kills occurring at Lake Washington. The most recent one occurred in \nAugust 2004. Lake Washington and other surface waters in the watershed have been under a fish \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n4-10 \nconsumption advisory for DDT and toxaphene in carp, buffalo, gar, and catfish larger than \n22 inches since 2001 (MDEQ 2003). \n \n4.5      Water      Quality      \n4.5.1   Standards   \nThe \n\ndesignated use class for surface waters in the Lake Washington watershed, as stated \nin the Mississippi water quality regulations, is Fish and Wildlife Support.

Table 4.4. lists the numeric water quality criteria \napplicable to Lake Washington watershed surface waters (MDEQ 2002). \nMississippi’s water quality standard for sediment is narrative and reads as follows: \n“Waters shall be free from materials attributed to municipal, industrial, agricultural or other \ndischarges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, sediment, turbidity, \nor other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render the waters injurious to public \nhealth, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or adversely affect the palatability of fish, \naesthetic quality, or impair the waters for any designated use” (MDEQ 2002). \n \nTable 4.4.

However, several water quality studies have been conducted on the lake \n(e.g., FTN 1991, MDEQ 1996, Tetra Tech 2003). There have been concerns related to Lake \nWashington water quality for over 30 years. The lake was closed to commercial fishing in the \n1970s due to pesticide contamination. Several fish kills occurred in 1986 and one occurred in \nAugust 2004. In 1990 a toxic algal bloom occurred that caused the death of several domestic \nanimals (MDEQ 1996). Clean Lake studies in 1991 and 1996 documented excessive algal \nblooms. While issues related to pesticides, nutrients, and organic enrichment in the lake have \nbecome less in recent years, recent monitoring results have indicated high nutrient levels and low \nDO levels (http://www.epa.gov/gmpo/lmrsbc/meetsum_lakewa_oct03.html\n). \nDuring 2002 to 2004, Lake Washington was sampled as part of MDEQ’s Lakes and \nReservoirs Nutrient Criteria Development Project.

TMDLs addressing these impairments were completed in 2003. \nThese TMDLs have been approved by USEPA Region IV, and Lake Washington and its \ntributaries are in the process of being removed from the 303(d) list (MDEQ 2005a). \n \nTable 4.6.

A TMDL addressing the pesticide impairment has been completed \n(MDEQ 2005b) and approved by USEPA Region IV. \n \n\n \n \n \n4-13 \n \n \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n4-14 \n4.5.3   TMDLs   \nTMDLs addressing the impairments of Lake Washington and its two listed tributaries \nhave been completed and approved; one addresses nutrients, organic enrichment/low DO, and \nsediment/siltation, and one addresses pesticides. \nA TMDL addressing organic enrichment/low DO and sediment/siltation has been \ncompleted and was approved by USEPA (Tetra Tech 2003). The TMDL report states that no \nknown point sources related to these pollutants/impairments are present in the watershed. \nNonpoint sources related to these pollutants/impairments, accounted for in the development of \nthe TMDL, included runoff from cultivated and non-cultivated agricultural lands, catfish pond \ndischarges, failing septic systems, and background sources (forest land). Since Mississippi does \nnot currently have numeric nutrient water quality criteria, a nutrient TMDL was not developed; \nhowever, nutrient contributions to oxygen demand were included in this TMDL. This TMDL \nrecommended a 50% reduction in the load of oxygen-demanding materials entering the listed \nwaterbodies in the watershed, and 32% to 59% reductions in sediment loads to the listed \nwaterbodies. \nThe pesticide impairments in the Lake Washington watershed (i.e., for Lake Washington, \ntributary MS404M2, and Lake Jackson) were addressed in pesticide TMDLs for the Yazoo River \nBasin (MDEQ 2003, 2005b). The target for these TMDLs was removal of fish consumption \nadvisories for DDT and toxaphene, and reduction of water column concentrations to the DDT \nhuman health and aquatic organism standard, and the toxaphene fresh water chronic standard. \nThe use of both DDT and toxaphene has been banned, and neither pesticide is currently being \napplied. Therefore, the methods proposed for achieving these targets included implementation of \nBMPs to reduce sediment loading to waterbodies (pesticides are present in basin soils) \n(MDEQ 2003) and natural attenuation (historical pesticide monitoring data from the Yazoo River \nBasin indicate a decreasing trend in pesticide concentrations in soils, fish tissue, and water) \n(MDEQ 2003, 2005b). \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-1 \n5.0 WATERSHED MANAGEMENT ACTIONS \n \nThere are two underlying management principles of this WIP: ecosystem-based \nmanagement and adaptive management. The goals and objectives of this plan reflect these \nprinciples. Each of these management principles is briefly described below, followed by \nwatershed management actions that are planned for the near future to work toward the vision for \nLake Washington. Goals related to other existing or potential concerns in this watershed will be \naddressed in future implementation plans. \n \n5.1      Ecosystem-Based      Management      \nLake Washington and its watershed represent the ecosystem management unit. Although \nLake Washington is typically considered the ecosystem, a lake and its watershed cannot be \ndivorced. Land use and land cover activities in the watershed directly or indirectly affect the \nlake. Sediment and nutrient loadings from the watershed drive many lake processes, including \nboth desirable and undesirable changes in the lake. The ecosystem, however, is characterized not \nonly by its environmental attributes, but also by its socioeconomic attributes. Humans are part of, \nnot apart from, aquatic ecosystems. Watershed management is fundamentally a social activity \n(Thornton and Creager 2001). \nThe benefits that accrue from reduced sediment and nutrient loadings to Lake \nWashington are not just associated with the lake in terms of increased water clarity, reduced \nsedimentation and loss of volume, reduced algal blooms, a more productive sport fishery, and \ngreater recreational and aesthetic values. The agricultural community also benefits from reduced \nsediment and nutrient loadings. For example, Pimentel et al. (1995) estimated that each ton of \nsediment lost was worth about $6.75 per year to the farmer ($5.00 per ton for lost nutrients, and \n$1.75 per ton for lost soil and water capacity). Using the TMDL estimates for tons of sediment \nentering Lake Washington per year, the minimum estimate of dollars lost from the watershed is \nabout $65,450 per year (9,695 tons per year x $6.75). This is equivalent to almost $50,000 in lost \nnutrients from the watershed and $15,000 in lost sediment and water capacity. These estimates \nare very conservative because they are based on yield from the watershed, not loss from the \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-2 \nfields (field losses are higher than delivery to the waterbody). An ecosystem-based approach is \nbeing used for watershed management in the Lake Washington watershed. \n \n5.2 Adaptive Management Process \nIn addition to ecosystem-based management, an adaptive management process is being \nused for watershed management in the Lake Washington watershed. Adaptive management is \n“learning by doing” and has become the recommended approach for ecosystem and natural \nresources management, including watershed management (Christensen et al. 1996; Holling 1978; \nJackson et al. 2001). Adaptive management has helped shift management from the concept that \nthere is a “balance of nature” to a more realistic concept that ecosystems are dynamic, \nnon-equilibrium systems. The environment is continually changing – climate, development, \nagricultural practices, demographics, and societal values. Adaptive management is the only \nfeasible approach for moving toward sustainable water resources (Coleman 1998). \nAdaptive management, or learning by doing, means that periodic assessments must be \nmade to determine if results-based criteria (e.g., largemouth bass catch per unit effort (CPUE) at \naround 20 fish per hour) are being attained and if the lake and watershed are moving toward the \ndesired vision for Lake Washington. The schedule for these periodic assessments and revision of \nthe watershed management plan is discussed in Chapter 8. The rotating basin approach used by \nMDEQ is part of this periodic assessment process. \n \n5.3 Watershed Management Actions \nWatershed management actions fall within seven general areas, discussed below. The \nseven general areas are: \n \n1. Sewerage Discharge Elimination; \n2. Sediment Loading Reductions; \n3. Nutrient Loading Reductions; \n4.         Fisheries         Management;         \n5. Cypress Forest Protection; \n6. Water Level Management; and \n7.         Alligator         Control.         \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-3 \nFor each category, there is a general introduction followed by a table(s) that provides \ninformation on the specific management action, its objective(s) and benefit(s), each of the \nparticipants involved in implementing the management activity, their role and responsibility, the \nschedule, the performance measure(s), and estimated budget. \n \n5.3.1   Sewerage   Discharge   Elimination   \nOur vision statement states, “Lake Washington provides a pleasant and safe place to live, \nfish, boat, and swim.” This watershed planning process was initiated primarily as a result of \nconcerns over raw sewage being discharged into Lake Washington. There are three management \nactions that are being taken to address the discharge of raw sewage into Lake Washington: \n \n1. Assess the feasibility of a regional sewer system around Lake Washington; \n2. Conduct a Sewage Summit to inform residents about decentralized and onsite \nseptic systems; and \n3. Eliminate direct discharge and failing septic system discharges into Lake \nWashington. \n \nEach of these management actions is briefly discussed and then highlighted in \nTables 5.1 – 5.3 at the end of this section. \n \n1. Regional Sewer Cost Estimate \nThe Washington County Board of Supervisors discussed the alternative of installing a \nregional sewer system around Lake Washington to connect with the Glen Allan wastewater \ntreatment facility in 2004 and 2005. It was determined that it was feasible to construct a regional \nsewer line around Lake Washington and connect to the Glen Allan facility. The cost of this effort \nwas unknown. This management action will determine the socioeconomic feasibility of a \nregional sewer system (Table 5.1). \n \n2.        Sewage        Summit        \nMany property owners are unaware of requirements, instituted by MSDH, MDEQ, and \nWashington County, regulating the installation, inspection, and maintenance of onsite \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-4 \nwastewater treatment systems (septic and decentralized wastewater treatment systems), as well \nas the new technologies available to them. Many property owners are also unaware of funding \nsources available for cost-share on the purchase and installation of onsite systems. This \nmanagement action will inform property owners, local and state officials, and others about \nonsite, decentralized wastewater treatment systems, and these options (Table 5.2). \n \n3. Eliminate Direct Discharge and Failing Septic System Discharges \ninto Lake Washington \nMSDH and MDEQ conducted an investigation of failing septic systems and sampled for \nfecal coliform indicators of pollution in 2005. Two failing septic systems were identified. The \nwater quality sampling indicated that water quality standards were being attained for fecal \ncoliforms. This was a one-time inspection and sampling and did not investigate direct discharges \ninto the lake. This management action will focus on 100% elimination of all sewage discharge \ninto Lake Washington (Table 5.3). This management action will also contribute to reducing \norganic enrichment of Lake Washington (see Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3). \n \n5.3.2   Sediment Loading Reduction \nPart of our vision for the Lake Washington watershed is that all waterbodies meet all \napplicable state water quality standards. In the watershed, Lake Washington, two of its \ntributaries, and Lake Jackson have been assessed as not meeting applicable water quality \nstandards due to sediments/siltation and organic enrichment/low DO (Figure 4.4). Three \nmanagement actions are being taken to reduce sediments/siltation by about 55% and associated \norganic matter loading by about 50% to Lake Washington: \n \n1. Repair failing culverts under Washington County roads; \n2. Implement sediment BMPs on agricultural fields in the watershed; and \n3. Maintain BMPs following implementation. \n \nManagement actions 2 and 3 will also reduce sediments/siltation to the listed Lake \nWashington tributaries and Lake Jackson by at least 32%, and associated organic matter loading \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-5 \nto these waterbodies by 50%. Each of these management actions is briefly discussed and then \nhighlighted in Tables 5.4 – 5.6 at the end of this section. \n \n1.        County        Road        Culverts        \nLand leveling and similar management practices in the watershed have resulted in county \nroads being below the level of neighboring fields. Ditches running through culverts under these \nroads are exhibiting head-cutting into the fields upstream of the culverts. This head-cutting is \ncaused because elevation differences between the culvert invert and fields have changed over \ntime. The location of these culverts is shown in Figure 5.1. This head-cutting has increased \nsediment loads to Lake Washington and sedimentation in the lake. The Washington County \nBoard of Supervisors will be contacted to evaluate the possibility of modifying the roads, \nculverts, or ditches to stop the head-cutting erosion. A Section 319 grant will be prepared to fund \npart of the cost of repairing the failing culverts. This management action will reduce one of the \nprimary sources of sediment entering Lake Washington and achieve part of the TMDL-\nrecommended sediment load reduction (Table 5.4). \n \n2.        Individual        Field Sediment BMPs \nSediment loading is also occurring from the erosion of individual agricultural fields. \nPotential sites for the installation of dropped inlets, grassed waterways, and vegetative buffer \nstrips (25 ft wide \n\nper state standards) have been identified (Figure 5.2). This management action \nwill address erosion and sediment transport from individual fields to the listed lakes and \ntributaries to achieve the remainder of the TMDL-recommended sediment load reduction \n(Table 5.5). \n \n3. Maintenance of BMPs \nAgricultural BMPs require some maintenance following implementation to remain \neffective. This management action will be taken to continue the maintenance of landowner \nBMPs following implementation (Table 5.6). \n \n\n \n \n \n5-6 \nFigure 5.1. Locations of county road culverts exhibiting head-cutting. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n5-7 \nFigure 5.2. Location for sediment and nutrient BMPs. \n \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-8 \n5.3.3   Nutrient Loading Reductions \nNumeric nutrient criteria are not available for most states, including Mississippi. \nHowever, nutrient reductions are anticipated to occur with the implementation of \nsediment/sedimentation BMPs because some nutrients (particularly phosphorus and organic \nnitrogen) absorb onto sediments. Reducing sediment loadings will have a concomitant reduction \nin nutrient loading. Some BMPs, such as filter strips, can remove up to 70% of the total \nphosphorous load leaving the agricultural field (Freedman et al. 2003). In addition, some \nsediment BMPs such as grassed waterways and vegetative buffer strips can remove soluble \nnutrients through vegetative uptake and incorporation in biomass. The anticipated reductions in \nnutrients associated with the sediment management practices are highlighted in Tables 5.7 – 5.8. \n \n1. Nutrient Reduction through Sediment Control \nBMPs for soil erosion and sediment load reductions have also been demonstrated to \nreduce nutrient loading to waterbodies because both phosphorus and nitrogen species can sorb \nonto sediment particles ((Freedman et al. 2003; Shaver et al. 2002). As much as a 70% reduction \nin total phosphorus loads have been observed by installing riparian filter strips at the fields edge \n(Freedman et al. 2003). Total phosphorus and total nitrogen load estimates were included in the \nLake Washington sediment TMDL (Tetra Tech 2003). For this management action, these loading \nestimates will be verified through field monitoring, as noted below in Table 5.7. The actual \nreduction in nutrient loading will be determined following the implementation of BMPs for \nsediment control. \n \n2.        Individual        Field Nutrient BMPs \nLake Washington has been selected as a nutrient reduction showcase for Mississippi as \npart of the Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Reduction Program. While there are not currently numeric \nnutrient criteria for Mississippi, these criteria are being developed. In the interim, nutrient targets \nhave been proposed for Lake Washington (see Section 4.5.2). As noted above, nutrient loading \nreductions through sediment control will be determined for Lake Washington, Lake Jackson, and \ntributary MS404M1. If additional nutrient loading reductions are needed following the \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-9 \nimplementation of sediment BMPs to achieve the Lake Washington nutrient targets, individual \nfield nutrient BMPs will be implemented as outlined in Table 5.8. \n \n5.3.4   Lake Washington Fishery \nIn our vision statement we envision Lake Washington as having a healthy, balanced, \nsport fishery, that attracts non-local anglers who contribute to the local economy. Current \nthinking is that there are too many catfish, shad, and drum in Lake Washington, and not enough \nbass and crappie. Because the fishery does contribute to the local economy, improving it also \ncontributes to the sustainability of the local economy and quality of life in the watershed, \nadditional elements that are included in our vision statement. Four management actions are \nproposed for managing the Lake Washington fisheries: \n \n1.         Game         fish         management;         \n2. Conduct Catfishing Clinic and Catfish Rodeo; \n3. Commercial harvest of catfish; and \n4. Public fishing pier. \n \nEach of these management actions is briefly discussed and then highlighted in \nTables 5.9 – 5.12 at the end of this section. \n \n1. Game Fish Management \nMDWFP has developed a fisheries management plan for Lake Washington \n(MDWFP 2005a) detailing activities that will be used to manage the fishery to achieve the \nfollowing overall goals: \n \n1. Increase largemouth bass stock; \n2. Increase crappie stock; \n3. Decrease shad stock; and \n4.         Decrease         catfish         stock.         \n \nSpecific management objectives associated with each of these overall goals are listed in \nTable 5.9. These objectives and management actions will be implemented, funded, and tracked \nby MDWFP. Activities to reduce drum in Lake Washington may be undertaken in later plans. \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-10 \n2.        Conduct        Catfishing        Clinic and Catfish Rodeo \nThe activities described under this action are potential activities only, and have not been \ndiscussed or committed to by anyone involved in the Lake Washington Watershed \nImplementation Team. \n“Catch a Tagged Catfish” is a promotion offered by Roy’s Store to promote catfish \nharvest on Lake Washington. Other sponsors are Budweiser, Lowe’s, Farm Bureau, Bostick \nBrothers, Pepsi, Guaranty Bank, Allstar Motors, Ceranti-Oakes Toyota, Washington County \nFarm Bureau, Longwood Flying Service, Delta Democrat Times, and Lake Washington \nLandowners Foundation. MDWFP tagged and released catfish in March 2005, March 2006, and \nMarch 2007. Those that catch a tagged catfish take the fish to Roy’s to see if they have won a \nt-shirt, a vendor product, or cash prizes up to $500.00. \nLocal sponsors could team with MDWFP to host a clinic on Lake Washington to teach \nchildren how to fish for catfish. A fishing pier could be built or a contract initiated to use a \nprivate pier where the pier is baited to attract catfish to the pier for the event. Publicity of the \nevent would highlight the abundance of catfish on Lake Washington to attract people to the lake \nto fish for catfish. The desired result of this action would be to increase harvest of catfish in Lake \nWashington, promote sport fishing harvest, and promote fishing, thereby decreasing the catfish \nstock in the lake. \n \n3. Commercial Harvest of Catfish \nThe catfish fishery in Lake Washington has the capacity to support commercial harvest. \nIncentives or contracts could be developed to promote commercial harvest of catfish in Lake \nWashington. One action would be to propose changes to Mississippi laws that would make it less \nexpensive for people to fish slat boxes on Lake Washington. The desired result of this action \nwould be to reduce the catfish stock in the lake, thereby allowing for increase of the gamefish \nstock. As the entity primarily responsible for the Lake Washington fishery, MDWFP would be \ninvolved in this action. Schedule and budget for this action will be developed if this action is \naccepted by the Lake Washington Watershed Implementation Team. \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-11 \n4. Public Fishing Pier \nCurrently, there is no public fishing pier on Lake Washington. Building a pier would not \nonly provide greater recreational opportunities for fishing on Lake Washington, but also \ncontribute to catfish harvest. This management action is to construct a fishing pier on Lake \nWashington. \n \n5.3.5   Watershed Cypress Forests Protection \nIn our vision statement we envision Lake Washington as having healthy shoreline cypress \nforest. Areas of cypress forest around Lake Washington have been damaged by very large flocks \nof cormorants roosting in them as the cormorants migrate through the area. Cypress forests \naround Lake Jackson are also being threatened by large flocks of cormorants as they move off of \nLake Washington. Cormorants have historically over-rested on Lake Washington during their \nspring and fall migration. However, the number of cormorants in recent years has exploded \nbecause of the aquaculture in the watershed. The intent of these management actions is to reduce \nthe number of cormorants to historical levels, not eliminate them from the lake ecosystem. In \naddition to damage from cormorants, cypress forests in the watershed are also being harvested by \nlandowners in ways that could affect the aesthetics of the watershed and the functioning of its \nsystems. Five management actions will be implemented to protect the cypress forests \nsurrounding Lake Washington: \n \n1. Cormorant harassment programs; \n2. Recruiting and training additional volunteers for cormorant harassment; \n3.         Cormorant         harvest;         \n4. Planting alternate cormorant roosting sites; and \n5. Educating landowners on the benefits and increased property value associated \nwith cypress forests. \n \nEach of these management actions is briefly discussed and then highlighted in \nTables 5.13 – 5.16 at the end of this section. \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-12 \n1. Cormorant Harassment Programs \nThe harassment program currently in use consists of three volunteers in boats using \npyrotechnics to scare off the cormorants when they begin to roost in large flocks on Lake \nWashington. Additional support is provided by volunteers firing pyrotechnics from the shore. \nThe cormorant harassment program implemented has been effective. While the reduction in birds \nhas been gradual over the past several years, damaged cypress trees are showing signs of \nrecovery, with new growth in damaged tree tops and branches. \n \n2. Recruiting and Training Additional Volunteers \nWhile the current harassment program has been effective, additional volunteers are \nneeded to continue to effectively implement it. USDA Wildlife Services is willing to provide \ntechnical support in the form of training for volunteers on implementing the program. \n \n3.        Cormorant        Harvest        \nUSDA Wildlife Services, US Game and Fish Commission, and MDWFP have initiated \ncormorant harvest in the Lake Washington watershed for control of the cormorant population in \nthe area. \n \n4. Planting Alternate Cormorant Roosting Sites \nThe activities described under this action are potential activities only, and have not been \ndiscussed or committed to by anyone involved in the Lake Washington Watershed \nImplementation Team. \nPlanting trees such as tupelo gum, cypress, oak, pecan, persimmon, and sycamore in \nother areas of the watershed could potentially relieve some of the roosting pressure. Providing \nmore alternate roosting areas could potentially reduce the number of cormorants roosting in the \ncypress forest around Lake Washington, and subsequently reduce the associated damage to that \nforest. Alternatively, roosts could be constructed in other areas of the watershed. Constructed \nroosts could be designed in such a manner that bird excrement could be collected and used as \nfertilizer, composted, or disposed of in some other safe manner. \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-13 \n5.        Educating        Landowners        \nA major element in any management program is creating public awareness of the \nimportance of the resource. This management action will be implemented through Public \nEducation and Outreach, which is discussed in Chapter 6. Cypress trees are an integral part of \nsouthern lakes, including Lake Washington. Cypress trees contribute not only to a number of \necosystem services, such as shoreline stabilization, fish habitat structure, and water temperature \nregulation, but also to socioeconomic benefits, such as increased property value, wind breaks, \nand lower air conditioning requirements and costs. Urban forestry studies have indicated that \neach tree greater than 3 inches in diameter can increase property values by up to $500.00 per \ntree. \n \n5.3.6   Lake Water Level Management \nStable lake levels contribute to our vision for Lake Washington as a recreational paradise \nwith enjoyable scenic vistas. In addition, stable lake levels contribute to stable vegetation and \nreduced erosion from drawdown and exposure. The management actions that will be \nimplemented for stable lake water levels are to repair the outlet structure and to establish a \nminimum lake level. These management actions are briefly discussed and then highlighted in \nTables 5.17 and 5.18 at the end of this section. \n \n1. Repair the Outlet Structure \nThe outlet pipes from the lake have rusted and, if not currently leaking, will soon leak. \nWhile replacing the outlet pipes, it will also be determined if stoplogs or a similar water level \nriser can be added to offset the loss of volume that has occurred through sedimentation. \nHowever, only a modest increase in water surface elevation can be permitted to prevent flooding \nor damage to existing docks and structures around the lake. This management action is presented \nin Table 5.17. \n \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n5-14 \n2. Establish Minimum Lake Level \nLake Washington is part of the state's water supplies available for out-of-lake beneficial \nuse. Water withdrawals for beneficial use should be managed under the regulations established \nby the Commission on Environmental Quality. A minimum lake level needs to be established for \nLake Washington to provide for effective management of water supplies and to protect lake \nwater levels. This management action is presented in Table 5.18. \n \n5.3.7   Alligator   Control   \nAlligators are native to the Lake Washington watershed and have historically been \npresent at Lake Washington. In recent years, however, alligators have occasionally moved into \npopulated areas of Lake Washington, posing a potential safety issue to residents. Two \nmanagement actions will be implemented to control alligator populations in Lake Washington: \n \n1. Eliminate fish processing waste from Lake Washington; and \n2. Alligator management plan. \n \nEach of these management actions is briefly discussed and then highlighted in \nTables 5.19 – 5.20 at the end of this section. \n \n1.        Eliminate        Fish        Processing        Waste from Lake Washington \nCommercial fish harvesting operations have dumped waste from fish processing into \nLake Washington, which likely has attracted alligators feeding on this waste to the populated \nareas of the lake.

USGS has committed to \ndeveloping and implementing a routine water quality monitoring program on Lake Washington. \nData from this program will be useful for identifying changes in lake water quality resulting \nfrom management activities. Table 7.1 is a summary of the monitoring methods and indicators \nplanned related to the management actions (described in Chapter 5.0) and the education and \noutreach activities (described in Chapter 6.0). These planned monitoring activities are described \nin detail below. \n \n7.2 Assessment of Progress \nImplementation milestones and schedules have been developed for the management \nactions and education and outreach activities described in this plan. This information is \nsummarized in Table 7.2 for use in tracking and evaluating implementation of this plan. For \nimplementation to be considered successful, all activity milestones must be met on time. \nThe Team will meet quarterly to review progress on achieving the milestones and make \nneeded adjustments to the schedule. Each Team member serves as the chair for one of the major \nmanagement categories, such as sewerage, sediment and nutrient loading, etc. There is a \nsubcommittee associated with each of these categories to ensure that the management actions are \nimplemented. \n \n7.2.1   Evaluation   of   Management   Actions and Education/Outreach \nActivities \nSpecific management action goals and/or expectations are described in Chapter 5.0. \nSpecific goals and/or expectations for education and outreach activities are described in \nChapter 6.0. If the activity goals were not met, the causes behind the failure to meet the goals \nwill be determined. In addition, the plan activities will be evaluated with regard to information \nand knowledge about the watershed and its waterbodies that has been gained since the existing \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n7-2 \nplan was developed, as well as any relevant physical changes in the watershed or changes in \npolicy affecting the watershed. Implementation of the activities will be reevaluated in light of all \nof this information on a quarterly basis, as discussed above. \n \n7.3 Evaluation of Plan \nSpecific management action schedules toward achieving the vision for the Lake \nWashington watershed are described in Chapters 5.0 and 6.0 and summarized in Table 7.2.

If the evaluation criteria are not being met, the approach for restoring Lake Washington \nwatershed quality will be revised based on knowledge that has been gained since 2007. The draft \nof the revised WIP will be completed one month after the evaluation has been completed. \nThe draft WIP will be submitted to the Team and all others who submitted comments. \nWithin two weeks of receiving the draft WIP, the Team will notify their stakeholders of the \navailability of the revised WIP for stakeholder review. One month will be allowed for review of \nthe draft. Comments will be due at the end of this review period. \nWithin a month after the comments on the draft WIP are received, the Team will prepare \na final updated WIP. The updated WIP will be submitted to the Team for review and approval. \nAfter the updated WIP has been approved, the Team will notify their stakeholders of the \ncompletion and availability of the updated WIP for use as a guide to watershed restoration and \nprotection activities. \nThe plan will be reviewed and revised following the MDEQ Rotating Basin schedule for \nthe Yazoo River Basin. This will permit the Team to incorporate monitoring information and \nassessment reports prepared by MDEQ. This approach also is consistent with adaptive \nmanagement and the process used by the Team for managing Lake Washington. \n\nDRAFT \nNovember 28, 2007 \n \n \n \n9-1 \n9.0 REFERENCES \n \nBurkhead, N.M., and R.E.
