A watershed implementation plan is a strategy that provides assessment and \nmanagement information for a geographically defined watershed, including analyses, actions, \nparticipants and resources related to developing and implementing the plan.\n2\n       \n \nWatershed plans vary to a degree based on the specific water resource impairments identified \nfor the watershed and the concerns and goals of stakeholders involved in the planning process.  \nMost watershed plans, however, include a vision, goals, assessment of current pollutant loads, \nfuture load reductions expected from implementing best management practice, a strategy for \neducating the public and expectations for monitoring and adapting the plan.  In addition, the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires nine elements be included in any \nwatershed plan funded with incremental Clean Water Act section 319 funds and strongly \nrecommends they be included in all watershed plans intended to address water quality \nimpairments (See Table 1).\n3\n \n \nTable 1: Cross Walk for Required Elements for WIP \nRequired WIP Element for 319 Grant Location in WIP \nWatershed Description and Background Section 2: Watershed Assessment \nImplementation Section 3.1:  Watershed Management Actions \nProject Goals Section 1.2.4: Goals \nProject Costs Appendix H: Management Actions \nEducation and Outreach Section 3.2:  Education and Outreach Activities \nImplementation Schedule Appendix H: Management Actions \nMilestones Appendix H: Management Actions \nAdaptations and Revisions Section 3.3.2: Adaptive Management and Plan Revision \nMonitoring Section 3.3.1: Monitoring Plan  \n \n \nStates are encouraged to develop statewide watershed planning frameworks to guide \nwatershed plans in their jurisdictions.  In 2008 the Mississippi Department of Environmental \nQuality’s (MDEQ) Basin Management Branch published “Guidance for Developing A Watershed \n1\n\nImplementation Plan.”  This guide, including the nine elements defined by the EPA for \nwatershed plans receiving section 319 funding, provides the framework for developing the \nRotten Bayou Watershed Implementation Plan. \n \n1.1.2 Why create a WIP for Rotten Bayou? \nDeveloping a watershed plan for Rotten Bayou Watershed is a key step in implementing the \nCoastal Nutrient Reduction Strategy and improving water quality in the watershed.\n4\n  The Rotten \nBayou Watershed (HUC 031700109-002) is 22,446 acres and lies in Hancock and Harrison \nCounties.  See Figure 1.  Rotten Bayou itself is a tributary of the Bay of St. Louis and was listed \non the EPA’s 2006 Section 303(d) list of impaired waterbodies for organic enrichment, low \ndissolved oxygen, turbidity, and nutrient levels that did not meet water quality standards.  The \nmain contributors to these environmental stressors do not come from a single source and so \nrequire a holistic approach to develop solutions.   Nonpoint source pollution can come from \nexcess fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides from agricultural lands and residential areas; oil, \ngrease and toxic chemicals from urban runoff; sediment from improperly managed construction \nsites, crop and forest lands, and eroding streambanks; and bacteria and nutrients from livestock, \npet wastes and faulty septic systems.  Addressing causes of nonpoint source pollution in Rotten \nBayou Watershed is a primary benefit of creating a watershed plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2\n\nFigure 1: Rotten Bayou Subwatershed \n \nSource: Map by Gulf Coast Community Design Studio \n \n \nIn 2011, U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) \nannounced the availability of up to 50 million dollars to help rehabilitate sixteen priority \nwatersheds in the five Gulf States over a three-year period. The initiative is part of the Gulf \nCoast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, created by Executive Order by President Obama in \nresponse to degradation of watersheds within the region, intensified by the Deep Horizon oil \n3\n\nspill.  Rotten Bayou Watershed and Bayou LaTerre Watershed in the Jourdan River Basin in \nMississippi are among the sixteen priority watersheds.\n5\n  An approved Watershed \nImplementation Plan and organized partnership for Rotten Bayou Watershed will improve the \nchances of bringing funding to the area. \n \nA Rotten Bayou Watershed Implementation Plan will also help coordinate and build momentum \naround the many conservation activities already taking place in the watershed.  Natural \nResource Conservation Service (NRCS), Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD), Soil and \nWater Conservation Commission (SWCC), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Mississippi State \nUniversity’s Water Resources Research Institute (WRRI) are actively working and funding \nactivities within the Rotten Bayou Watershed as part of an innovative water and wildlife \nconservation effort along the Gulf Coast called the Gulf of Mexico Initiative (GoMI).  Current \nactivities and related plans are further discussed in Section 1.3. \n \n1.1.3 Process and Acknowledgements \nIn 2012, MDEQ enlisted the Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain (LTMCP) to guide \nplanning work, education efforts and the implementation of restoration actions in Rotten Bayou \nWatershed pursuant to an approved Watershed Implementation Plan.  Since 2006, LMTCP has \nworked to develop partnerships and plans for six watersheds in southern Mississippi including \nOld Fort Bayou, Red Creek, Turkey Creek, Tuxachanie-Tchoutacabouffa, Upper Bay St. Louis and \nWest Boley Creek.  The larger Upper Bay St. Louis Watershed includes the Rotten Bayou \nsubwatershed. \n \nThe Rotten Bayou Watershed Project is funded partly through the EPA’s Non-point Source Grant \nC9994866-11-0 and partly through State and local match.  LTMCP hired Mississippi State \nUniversity’s Gulf Coast Community Design Studio in December 2013 to facilitate the \ndevelopment of the Watershed Implementation Plan and related outreach and design work.  \nThe first step in the planning process was to assemble a Watershed Implementation Team \nrepresenting various stakeholders in Rotten Bayou Watershed.  See Section 1.2.1.  This team \nincludes a Steering Committee made up primarily of local leadership and residents, a Technical \nAdvisory Committee consisting of staff from various public agencies and private firms with \nexpertise related to the watershed planning, and an Education and Outreach Committee to \nguide the public engagement portion of the work. \n \nThe Steering Committee first discussed assets and concerns related to the watershed and water \nquality and determined a vision and goals for watershed planning in Rotten Bayou that would \nguide the committee and future work. See Sections 1.2.2 – 1.2.4.  The Steering Committee and \nTechnical Advisory Committee then set to work collecting and analyzing available data related to \nRotten Bayou Watershed.  This information is included in Section 2 and has informed the \nongoing outreach and education efforts, as well as the management and monitoring plans \nincluded in Section 3.  Natural Capital Development and Anchor QEA, LLC  were hired as project \nconsultants between June and December 2014 to analyze available draft water quality data for \nRotten Bayou as compared to the TMDL and approved thresholds.  See Appendix C: Rotten \nBayou Water Quality Assessment.  The Education and Outreach Subcommittee was critical to \nthe implementation of public engagement activities carried out during the planning period and \ndevelopment of a plan for future activities.

\n Habitat/Wildlife \n People/community \n Recreation \n Local support for Nature Tourism \n Water Quality \n Connection to Bay of St. Louis \n Limited Farmland \n Good Stormwater Management \n Supportive Government \n Funding  \n Monitoring Plan in Place \n Concurrent Work \n GIS Database of Drainage \n Proactive Golf Course Management \n \nConcerns/Challenges: \n Erosion/Sedimentation \n Pollution \n Stormwater Drainage \n Plan Implementation \n Water Quality \n Plan Content \n Wildlife \n Stakeholder Participation \n Access/Boating \n Development \n Failing Septic Tanks \n Coordination with other Work/Plans \n \n7\n\n1.2.3 Vision \nThe community envisions a clean bayou and watershed that exceeds water quality standards, \nprovides habitat for native wildlife and creates meaningful recreational and stewardship \nopportunities for residents and visitors.  \n \n1.2.4 Goals and Objectives \nThis WIP will address the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for nutrients, organic enrichment \nand low dissolved oxygen for listed tributaries to St. Louis Bay including Rotten Bayou as \napproved by MDEQ in 2007.  According to the TMDL, the model showed that no reductions in \norganic material are needed in Rotten Bayou in order to meet water quality standards.  The \nmodel did show that reductions in nutrients, specifically total nitrogen (TN) are needed.\n6\n  The \nTMDL recommends a 9%-19% reduction of the TN loads entering the listed tributaries to \nmeeting a target of 1.5 mg/l.\n7\n  This recommendation, however, is not specific to Rotten Bayou \nand an assessment of current conditions shows that Rotten Bayou and its tributaries are not \ncurrently exceeding TN loads of 1.5 mg/l.  See Section 2.4.6 Current Status of Water Bodies.  \nWhile this WIP does not recommend a specific reduction in TN or total phosphorus (TP), it does \nrecommend taking measures to reduce nutrient loads coming from nonpoint sources in the \nwatershed.  The following goals were developed by the Steering Committee for the Rotten \nBayou WIP. \n1. Reduce erosion and sedimentation to improve water quality, wildlife habitat and \nnavigability of Rotten Bayou \na. Identify and target key sources of erosion \nb. Protect and re-establish riparian buffers where possible \nc. Restore areas of Rotten Bayou and major tributaries that have experienced \nextreme siltation that is impacting water quality, habitat and navigability \n \n2. Reduce pollutants entering water system \na. Reduce TN and TP levels in Rotten Bayou \nb. Reduce number of nonfunctioning septic systems in the watershed and other \nsources of harmful bacteria \nc. Reduce litter entering the drainage system and waterways \n \n3. Reduce stormwater runoff and improve drainage to decrease risk of flooding \na. Encourage policies and practices aimed at minimizing the creation of new \nimpervious surfaces \nb. Encourage conservation of critical wetlands and natural water holding areas \nc. Encourage designs and practices that increase on-site infiltration \n \n4. Improve access to recreational opportunities on and around Rotten Bayou \na. Increase the number of access points to Rotten Bayou that are open to the \npublic \nb. Promote opportunities for the public to recreate on or near Rotten Bayou in \nenvironmentally sensitive ways \nc. Facilitate designation of Rotten Bayou as a blueway \n \n8\n\n5. Increase stewardship and stakeholder participation within the watershed \na. Plan for the longevity of the Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership \nb. Develop and implement plan for continued education and outreach \nc. Create opportunities for citizen participation and stewardship \n \n1.3 Related Plans and Projects  \nA significant amount of planning and plan implementation has been done that relates to watershed \nplanning in Rotten Bayou watershed.

While the largest Choctaw town in the area was about one \nhalf mile from Caesar (near present-day Picayune), there are reports of smaller settlements in \nthe Diamondhead area.  Rotten Bayou, or Banshawah meaning “decayed stream” as the \nChoctaw called it, got its name because of the odor that resulted from the Indians dressing their \ngame on the shores of the Bayou.\n8\n  Over the years, Yellow Fever, war and colonial initiatives \nsuch as the Indian Removal Act of 1830 greatly reduced the native population in Hancock \nCounty.\n9\n   \n \nEarly Spanish, French and English settlers, who called the area West Florida, lived primarily \nalong the Pearl River.  The early pioneers lived off the land as hunters and trappers with a few \nsupplemental subsistence crops.  A few raised cash crops such as tobacco, indigo, rice or \ncotton.\n10\n  Later, logging became a source of income.  There was an abundance of timber along \nthe banks of the rivers and creeks in the area that was hand-hewn and shipped along the Pearl \nRiver to New Orleans where residents used wood for building, heating and cooking.  Lumber cut \nin Hancock County was also shipped as far away as Central and South America.  Following a \nhurricane in the late 1700’s that leveled a good deal of trees in the area, residents began \nprocessing pine-tar.  Both the pine-tar and byproduct, charcoal, were exported to New Orleans \nand other areas.  Much of this activity, however, was occurring along the Pearl River in the \nPearlington-Logtown area and not in the Rotten Bayou Watershed.\n11\n  By the 1840’s a small \nnumber of logs were being transported down the Jourdan and Wolf Rivers, but little commercial \nactivity was reported along Rotten Bayou.\n12\n  The first mill in the watershed appears to have \nbeen established sometime in the mid to late 1800’s at the junction of Rotten Bayou and Bayou \nLaTerre in the old community of Fenton by a young Frenchman named Adolphe Kergosien.\n13\n  \nAccording to Nollie W. Hickman in Mississippi Harvest  (as cited in Ellis, 2000), by 1840, 10 \nsawmills were operating in Hancock County and western Harrison County in what was known as \nthe Three Rivers Mission area encompassing the Wolf River to the East, the Jourdan River in the \nmiddle and the Pearl River to the West.\n14\n \n \n11\n\n   \n \n \nThe heavy lumbering business in the area took its toll on the waterways.  J.E. Farve described \nthe change: \n \nThe town of Kiln got its name from the tar and charcoal kilns.  I remember when \ncharcoal was sent by schooner down Bayou LaTerre, and the bayou was 60 feet \ndeep – but now, we can wade across it at times, because the erosion from the \nloss of trees caused sand to wash in and fill up the bottoms.\n15\n \n \nThe effects of erosion and sedimentation can still be seen in the bayous and waterways, \nespecially in places like Devil’s Elbow of Rotten Bayou, though now as a result of increased \ndevelopment as opposed to lumbering. \n \nBy the early 1900’s, oil of turpentine was being produced in Hancock County.  R. R. Perkins, \npresident of Imperial Naval Stores Company, operated a branch in the community of Fenton just \nnorth of Diamondhead.  The oil was hauled in barrels by wagon to Gulfport and loaded onto \nbarges for delivery to its final destinations. \n \n12\n\n \n \n \nThe Great Depression saw the decline of the lumber industries in the area and the Prohibition \nspurred an easy transition to distilling alcohol.  Father Henry McInerny stated: \n \nWith the proliferation of kilns for distilling turpentine and for curing lumber, it \nprobably seemed fairly logical to experiment with distilling alcohol.  In the days \nof prohibition, it made this option all the more lucrative.  However, it seems \nthat it was not until after the depression and the loss of the lumber and sawmill \nbusiness here that, for many people, it was probably done out of necessity as \nmuch as anything.  It has been told to me, by one who knows, that at the height \nof its popularity, there were probably up to 50 stills operating in these parts.\n16\n \n \nWhiskey making was a big business in the area and saw large growth spurts after the Mississippi \nProhibition Act was passed in 1908 and again after the National Prohibition Act was passed in \n1918.  Kiln liquor had a reputation for its quality and high alcohol content as far north as \nMilwaukee and there were tales of giant stills hidden under piles of sawdust from the area’s \nlumbering days.\n17\n \n \n13\n\n \n \n \nThe Catholic church had a large presence in the Three Rivers Mission area and by the 1840’s \nthere were three reported Catholic churches in the watershed.  One was called St. Joseph and \nwas located on Rotten Bayou and another was located on Kiln-Delisle Road between Kapalama \nRoad and Fenton Road.  A third church called St. Joseph Chapel was located on Fenton Road that \nremained until the 1980’s.\n18\n  St. Joseph’s Cemetery, also known as Rotten Bayou Cementary, is \nlocated just north of Diamondhead.  The cemetery was said to be a burial place long before \nthere were any marked graves.  Early funeral processions came by boat through Jourdan River \nand Rotten Bayou before there were any roads in the area.  The Moran (Morin) family owned \nthe land in the early 1800’s before Francois Cuevas (descendent of Juan Cuevas of Cat Island) \nmarried Felicity Moran.\n19\n  The Cuevas’ later donated the 40-acre cemetery to Hancock County in \n1893.\n20\n   \n \nBy the mid-1960’s, Federal interstate highways were being constructed in stretches across the \ncoast.  Plans for Diamondhead, what was to be the largest residential/resort community in the \nsouth were announced in 1969.  The project was named Diamondhead because it was on the \nhighest ground on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and was to feature Hawaiian-style architecture and \nlandscaping.  The 6,500-acre property, formerly owned by the Gex family, was located north of \nSt. Louis Bay with two miles of shoreline on the Bay and another nine miles on Rotten Bayou.  \nThe master plan, when fully completed, was expected to exceed $100,000,000 and include a \nshopping center, schools, churches and other amenities including a 36-hole golf course.\n21\n  As of \nthe 2010 census, there were 8,425 people living in Diamondhead and on February 6, 2012, \nDiamondhead became Mississippi’s 111th city. \n \n14\n\n2.1.3 Current and Future Land Use \nThe watershed is primarily undeveloped (51.8%) and lower density, single family residential \n(43%).  The remainder of the watershed is golf course (2.1%), agricultural (1.6%), commercial \n(1.4%) and multi-family residential (0.1%).\n22\n See Figure 2.  Only about 0.1% of land in Rotten \nBayou Watershed is publically owned.   \n \nFigure 2:  Current Land Use      \n \nSource: Land use data from Gulf Regional Planning Commission. Map by Gulf Coast Community Design Studio \n15\n\nIn terms of opportunity for future development, there are currently 2,017 parcels considered \n“vacant and undeveloped,” though due to wetland and flood plain constraints not all of these \nparcels are likely to be suitable for development.  There are some plans for additional \ncommercial development in the City of Diamondhead and opportunities for more residential \ndevelopment, particularly single family, throughout the watershed that will likely impact \nstormwater runoff in the future.  The increase in commercial land use could be about 4% in the \nwatershed according to the jurisdictions’ comprehensive plans.\n23\n    Within Diamondhead there is \napproximately one square mile of remaining developable land.\n24\n  The planned increase in \nresidential development is harder to determine because Harrison County does not distinguish \nbetween agriculture and rural single family residential in the future plan use component of their \ncomprehensive plan. \n \n \n2.2 Human Resources \n2.2.1 Demographics \nAs of the 2010 Census, there were 25,619 people living in the watershed, of which 8,425 live in \nthe city limits of Diamondhead.  Of the total population, 90.3% are White, 4.5% are \nBlack/African American, 2.5% are Hispanic/Latino(a), and 0.7% are Asian.  According to the \nAmerican Community Survey’s 2011-5 year estimates, 15.5% of the population is living below \nthe poverty limit.  This is fairly consistent with the national poverty rate (15.1%) and below the \n20% threshold that is considered the rate of high poverty for rural areas and tipping point at \nwhich poverty will continue to grow in neighborhoods.\n252627\n \n \nThere are a total of 11,537 housing units within Rotten Bayou Watershed.  Of the built housing \nunits, 85.3% are occupied and 14.7% are vacant.  This is a relatively high vacancy rate compared \nto the national vacancy rate (7.9%), but consistent with the vacancy rate for the three coastal \ncounties (14.3%) and indicates that the population has still not recovered since Hurricane \nKatrina.  The majority of the housing in the watershed is owner occupied (85.7%) which may be \na positive factor in improving environmental stewardship in the watershed.\n 28\n \n \n2.2.2 Municipal \nRotten Bayou Watershed is a multi-jurisdictional watershed.  The watershed is almost perfectly \ndivided in half between Hancock County to the west and Harrison County to the east.  \nMississippi’s newest city, Diamondhead, makes up the southwestern quadrant of the \nwatershed.  Further complicating bureaucracy in the watershed is the existence of the \nDiamondhead Country Club and Property Owners Association (DPOA) that maintains a level of \ncontrol over platted residential property in Diamondhead.  The DPOA is further discussed in \nSection 2.2.3. \nMultiple water and sewer districts have jurisdiction in the area including Diamondhead Water \nand Sewer District, Hancock County Water and Sewer District, and the Harrison County Utility \nAuthority.  The complex and multi-jurisdictional nature of Rotten Bayou watershed presents a \nchallenge for, but also a greater justification for planning and collaboration in the watershed \naround issues of water quality. \n \n16\n\n2.2.3 Civic Infrastructure \nThere are several civic organizations that are active in Rotten Bayou Watershed and important \nto current and future watershed protection strategies.  These include, but are not limited to the \nDiamondhead Property Owners Association, Keep Diamondhead Beautiful, Diamondhead \nGarden Club, Rotary Club of Central Hancock County, Hancock and Harrison County Master \nGardeners, Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain and the Mississippi State University \nExtension Service.  Brief descriptions of each organization are included below. \nDiamondhead Country Club and Property Owners Association \nThe Diamondhead Property Owners Association (DPOA) is a non-profit corporation tasked with \nmanaging and developing civic and recreational assets in the community of Diamondhead.  The \nmission of the organization is to “protect and preserve the assets and amenities of the \nDiamondhead POA, to seek and implement programs for improvements that will enhance \nquality of life, and to provide sound competent governance and financial and operational \nmanagement for all POA functions.” The POA is committed to serving all members and residents \nof the larger community.  Currently, the POA owns and operates a country club with two \nrestaurants and banquet services; two golf courses; three pools; tennis facilities; several parks \nand walking trails; a marina; and an airport.  All amenities are open to and regularly used by the \npublic at large though some require membership dues.   \nIn addition to the main property owners association, the Devil's Elbow community within \nDiamondhead has a separate POA.  Devil’s Elbow is a creole-designed, private community \nnestled along Rotten Bayou.  Residents of Devil’s Elbow are strong advocates for preserving the \nnatural habitat of Rotten Bayou and regularly enjoy boating, kayaking, fishing, and bird-\nwatching. \nLand Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain \nThe Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain (LTMCP) was founded in 2000 and works in the \nsix coastal counties of Mississippi.  The organization strives to conserve, promote and protect \nopen spaces and green places of ecological, cultural or scenic significance in the counties of the \nMississippi Coastal Plain.  LTMCP is accredited by the Land Trust Accreditation Commission, an \nindependent program of the Land Trust Alliance, and has worked with landowners and local \nauthorities to protect over 8000 acres of valuable wetlands and environmentally significant land \nin the region.    \nKeep Diamondhead Beautiful \nKeep Diamondhead Beautiful was established in December 2013 by resolution of the City of \nDiamondhead.  The Keep Diamondhead Beautiful Committee focuses on beautifying the City of \nDiamondhead, involving the community in the beautification efforts, continuing to support the \nsense of pride that already exists in the City of Diamondhead by encouraging the citizens and \nthe administration to provide a clean and litter free environment, by helping to develop \nlandscaping and maintenance plans and projects for the safety and beauty of the City of \nDiamondhead. \nDiamondhead Garden Club \nThe Diamondhead Garden Club has been an active community partner since 1972.  Members \nhave worked to landscape many areas of the community and hold monthly meetings featuring \n17\n\nspeakers that cover topics ranging from birds and plants to conservation and best practices.  The \nGarden Club sponsors an annual flower show that also features educational exhibits. These \nEducational Exhibits always focus on information that educates the public about the \nenvironmental and beautification goals of the National Garden Clubs, Inc.   \nMississippi State University Extension Service \nThe Mississippi State University Extension Service provides research-based information, \neducational programs, and technology transfer focused on issues and needs of the people of \nMississippi, enabling them to make informed decisions about their economic, social, and cultural \nwell-being.  Core programs include agriculture and natural resources, family and consumer \neducation, enterprise and community resource development and 4-H youth development.  The \nMSU Extension also coordinates the Master Gardener Volunteer program.  Through this \nprogram, individuals are trained and certified in consumer horticulture and related areas.  The \nprogram allows the local Extension Service to reach a larger gardening audience.  Continuing \neducation is offered to encourage long-term commitments and most certified Master Gardeners \nserve five to seven years. Master Gardener programs are active in both Hancock and Harrison \nCounties. \nRotary Club of Central Hancock County \nRotary is an organization of business and professional persons united worldwide who provide \nhumanitarian service, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill \nand peace in the world.  The Rotary Club of Central Hancock County has several key focus areas \nincluding clean water and participates with other civic organizations in the Mississippi Coastal \nCleanup, watershed cleanup activities and community gardening.  \n \n2.3 Physical Setting \n2.3.1 Soils and Geology \nThe soil and geology of a drainage area make up the hydrogeologic setting of a watershed.  The \ntype and distribution of the materials that affect the surface and substrate are important to \nunderstand in watershed planning because they greatly influence the response of surface water \nboth to precipitation and contaminants.   In addition, the hydrogeologic conditions influence \nwhich Best Management Practices are most suitable for a given area.  A good understanding of \nthe soil types and geologic characteristics of a watershed will both improve the effectiveness \nand efficiency of strategies recommended and implemented through a watershed \nimplementation plan. \n \nThe geological makeup of the Rotten Bayou Watershed, and most of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, \nis characterized by sedimentary formations of estuarine and deltaic origin ranging from the late \nOligocene to the Holocene epochs.\n29\n  See Figure 3.  According to MDEQ’s Office of Geology, \nthere is still a lot of uncertainty around the geology in Gulf region extending from east Texas to \nthe Florida line and the last published study was in 1944.\n30\n \n \n \n \n \n18\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Chronology of the Formation of the Coastal Geology \n \n \n \nSource: Ohio State University. (2012). Mississippi Gulf Coast Water Assessment. \n \n \nThe primary importance of geology in watershed planning is its effect on soil characteristics, \ndescribed below, and groundwater aquifers, further discussed in Section 2.4.1.  Soil texture and \nparticle size determine how surface water will travel over or through the ground.  The majority \nof the watershed consists of silt and sandy loam soils. Predominate soils are Poarch, Atmore, \nand Harleston in the uplands and Bigbee-Bibb in the bottomlands.\n31\n   \n \nSoils can be assigned to hydrologic soil groups based on factors such as measured rainfall, \nrunoff, and infiltration data.  The slope of the soil surface, however, is not considered when \nassigning hydrologic soil groups.\n32\n  Soils in the United States are assigned to four groups (A, B, C, \nand D) and three dual classes (A/D, B/D, and C/D). Group A soils have the highest rate of \ninfiltration and group D has the slowest infiltration rate.  Hydrologic Soil data from the National \nResources Conservation Service (NRCS) Gridded Soil Survey Geographic Database (gSSURGO) \nwas assessed for Rotten Bayou Watershed.  In Rotten Bayou watershed, 56% of the land falls \ninto categories A and B, meaning the soils in these areas have higher infiltration rates.  Thirty-\nthree percent falls into categories C and D and have soils that have much slower infiltration \nrates.  See Figure 4. \n \n \n \n \n19\n\n \nFigure 4: Dominant Hydrologic Soil Groups Rotten Bayou Watershed \n   \nSource: Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) Database for Mississippi. United States Department of Agriculture, \nNatural Resources Conservation Service. Available online at http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/. [Accessed \n11/25/2014].  Map by NOAA’s National Coastal Data Development Center. \n \n \nThe types and location of soils often determine what managerial, structural or vegetative \nactivities are feasible.  Areas that contain soils with high infiltration rates are directly responsible \nfor infiltrating precipitation and feeding the upper reaches of the watershed with groundwater \ninflow that function to moderate flows and maintain a cool water temperature regime.  \nProtection of these areas is extremely important to maintain existing high water quality. These \nareas are also are more suitable for the installation of BMPs that function to increase \ninfiltration.  On the other hand, areas that contain soils with slow infiltration rates tend to be \nmore susceptible to erosion if not properly managed and vegetated.  The areas with poor \n20\n\ndrainage are also not well-suited for septic systems.  Section 2.4.6 further explores the extent of \nnonfunctioning septic systems in Rotten Bayou Watershed.  Several of the areas identified as \nhaving poor drainage do appear to coincide with some of the nonfunctioning septic systems \nidentified, especially in Harrison County. \n \n2.3.2 Ecoregion \nEcoregions are generally defined as an area with a relative homogeneous ecosystem. \nGeographic areas are assigned to different ecoregions based on biotic and abiotic characteristics \nincluding geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife and hydrology.\n33\n  \nEcoregions are intended to provide a geographic area for ecosystem assessment, monitoring \nand management.\n34\n  Traditionally, ecoregions and watersheds have been treated as two \nseparate frameworks for environmental assessment and management, but more recently are \nbeing used in coordination with one another: \n \nAlthough ecoregions and watersheds are intended for different purposes, they can be \ncomplementary.  Ecoregions provide the spatial framework within which the quality and \nquantity of environmental resources, and ecosystems in general, can be expected to \nexhibit a particular pattern. Where watersheds are relevant and can be defined, they \nare necessary for studying the relationships of natural and anthropogenic phenomena \nwith water quality, as well as for providing the spatial unit for reference areas within \necoregions at all scales.\n35\n  \n \nRotten Bayou Watershed extends into two ecoregions.  The northern portion of the watershed \nis in the Southeastern Plains ecoregion and the southern portion of the watershed is in the \nSouthern Coastal Plains ecoregion.  While there is a distinct divide between the two ecoregions \nfor mapping and analysis purposes, ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges.\n36\n \n \nThe Southeastern Plains are a mix of cropland, pasture, woodland, and forest. Natural \nvegetation consisted predominantly of longleaf pine, with smaller areas of oak-hickory-pine and \nSouthern mixed forest. Elevations and relief are greater than in the Southern Coastal Plain, but \ngenerally less than in much of the Piedmont. Streams in this area are generally lower-gradient \nand have sandy bottoms.\n37\n \nThe Southern Coastal Plain consists of mostly flat plains, but also includes barrier islands, coastal \nlagoons, marshes, and swampy lowlands along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.  Forests historically \nconsisted of longleaf pine, slash pine, pond pine, beech, sweetgum, southern magnolia, white \noak, and laurel oak, but is now mostly slash and loblolly pine with oak-gum-cypress forest in \nsome low lying areas, citrus groves in Florida, pasture for beef cattle, and urban areas.\n38\n \n \n2.3.3 Wetlands \nWetlands are critical to protecting water quality and moderating water quantity.  Some of these \n“wetland services” that protect water quality and quantity include providing erosion control, \nflood protection, filtration, critical habitat and carbon sequestration.  Coastal wetland losses \noccur as a result of both human activity and natural processes.  Human activities such as urban \ndevelopment can remove wetlands, harden shorelines and change overall hydrology.  Natural \nprocesses such as erosion and inundation from sea level rise and storms can also affect \n21\n\nwetlands.\n39\n  Following the State’s passage of the Coastal Wetland Protection Act, wetland loss \ndue to development fell dramatically while coastal erosion became the major contributor of \nwetland loss.\n40\n   \n \nRotten Bayou watershed is comprised of a mix of wetland environments including estuarine, \nfreshwater and riverine, the most common being freshwater forested/scrub wetlands that \nextend throughout the reaches of the watershed.  Overall, about 20% of the land area in the \nwatershed is classified as “wetlands” as defined by the Mississippi Department of Marine \nResources (MDMR).  See Figure 5.   \n \n \nFigure 5: Wetlands in Rotten Bayou Watershed \n \nSource: Map and analysis by the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources Coastal Preserves Program (2014). \n \nWetlands in Rotten Bayou watershed are under the jurisdiction of MDMR’s Coastal Program \naccording to Section 57-15-6 of the Mississippi Code of 1972.  Rotten Bayou watershed is part of \n22\n\nthe Mississippi Coastal Zone which includes Hancock, Harrison and Jackson Counties. \nImplementation of the Coastal Program is the primary responsibility of the Office of Coastal \nZone Management and includes administering the Coastal Preserves Program, Wetlands \nPermitting, and other special projects.  Wetland activities that are regulated include: \n \nDredging, excavating or removing of soil, mud, sand, gravel, flora, fauna, or aggregate \nof any kind from any coastal wetlands; dumping, filling or depositing of any soil, \nstones, sand, gravel, mud aggregate or of any kind or garbage, either directly or \nindirectly, on or in any coastal wetlands; killing or materially damaging any flora or \nfauna on or in any coastal wetlands; and the erection on coastal wetlands of \nstructures which materially affect the ebb and flow of the tide; and the erection of any \nstructure on suitable sites for water dependent industry. The use of the term \n“indirectly” in this definition covers the possibility of activities located outside of \ncoastal wetlands which cause dumping, filling, or depositing in coastal wetlands.\n41\n \n \nApplications for wetlands activities in the Mississippi Coastal Zone are submitted through \nMDMR, but also reviewed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under the \nMemorandum of Agreement with the Mobile and Vicksburg Districts of the USACE.\n42\n \n \n2.3.4 Climate and Climate Change \nRotten Bayou Watershed, and Mississippi, in general, are located in a humid subtropical climate \nregion, characterized by temperate winters; long, hot summers; and rainfall that is fairly evenly \ndistributed through the year. The region, however, is subject to periods of both drought and \nflood, and determining \"average\" conditions is challenging. Prevailing southerly winds provide \nmoisture for high humidity and potential discomfort from May through September. Locally \nviolent and destructive thunderstorms are a threat on an average of about 60 days each year. \nEight hurricanes have struck Mississippi's coast since 1895, and tornadoes are a particular \ndanger, especially during the spring season.\n43\n \nNormal mean annual temperatures are 68F along the coast. Low temperatures have dropped to \n16F below zero while high temperatures exceed 90F over 100 days each year. Temperatures \nroutinely exceed 100F at many places in the state each year and drop to zero or lower an \naverage of once in five years in the state. Normal precipitation ranges from about 50 to 65 \ninches across the state from north to south.\n44\n  \nClimate change is likely to affect several processes that will impact watershed dynamics in \ncoastal Mississippi and Rotten Bayou watershed including sea level rise and frequency and \nduration of rainfall events.  There are various estimates of sea level rise resulting from climate \nchange, but even according to the most conservative predictions, substantial flooding of coastal \narea appears to be likely.  There is also a limited amount of local and regional sea level rise data \navailable for the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  Based on available data, Mississippi expects a minimum \nsea level rise of approximately 10 inches by the year 2100. However, gaps in the data available \nand a lack of long term historical trends may affect the accuracy of this prediction.\n45\n Sea level \nrise is likely to have a significant impact on wetlands in the area: \n \nA rise in sea level inundates the coastal vegetated lands, converting them into areas of \nopen water and resulting in a loss of wetland functions.  Although new wetlands may be \n23\n\ncreated further towards the inland if the coastal topography is ideal (i.e., in the \npresence of gradually increasing slope), whether or not they can make up the loss due \nto sea level rise largely depends on the extent of land development on the newly \nflooded area, as well as the rate at which the replacing wetland ecosystem functions can \nbe fully established.\n46\n \n \nNOAA’s Digital Coast Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer is a tool for visualizing \nimpacts of sea level rise from one foot to five feet.  When comparing the impacts of sea level \nrise in Rotten Bayou Watershed (See Figure 6) to existing wetland habitat shown in Figure 5 it is \napparent that a substantial amount of wetland habitat in the watershed could be compromised \nby sea level rise.  This is important in terms of planning to protect inland wetlands and allowing \nfor buffers around waterways wherever possible. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n24\n\nFigure 6: Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts on Rotten Bayou Watershed \n \n \nIn addition to sea level rise, moisture deficits and drought are likely to increase across the \nMississippi Gulf Coast.\n47\n  This could have an effect on vegetation important for soil stabilization \nand habitat, as well as ground water recharge.  Alternately, heavy rainfall events have been and \nare likely to continue increasing.  Intense rainfall events contribute to stormwater runoff \nincreasing flooding, erosion and influx of pollutants into the water system. \n \n \n \n \n25\n\n2.3.5 Conservation Mapping \nIn 2010 the Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain and consultant, CDM Smith, undertook a \nproject known as Conservation Legacy to develop a toolkit for conserving land in a more \nstrategic manner in the six coastal counties of Mississippi.  One of the products was a Map of \nPotential Conservation Lands that is a model of the suitability of land for conservation based on \nranked environmental and land use conditions including wetlands, hydrological soil groups, \nflood zones, elevation/slope, upland forest and important ecosystems.\n48\n \nAreas that are in Rotten Bayou watershed and currently undeveloped were identified as being \nrelatively high priority (6/7/8) areas in terms of conservation and should be considered in \nplanning and management strategies for Rotten Bayou Watershed. See Figure 7. \n \nFigure 7: Conservation Priority Areas in Rotten Bayou Watershed. \n \nSource: Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain. Conservation Legacy: Potential Conservation Lands Map. \n<http://gis.co.harrison.ms.us/landtrust/>. Accessed 4 December 2014. \n26\n\n2.4 Water Resources \n2.4.1 Groundwater \nThere are 16 major aquifers and various minor aquifers throughout Mississippi.  The \ngroundwater resources found in these aquifers supplies over 90% of Mississippi’s drinking water \nsupply.  In the coastal counties, drinking water and potable water is mainly supplied through the \nGrand Gulf Aquifer System which includes, in ascending order, the Catahoula, Hattiesburg, \nPascagoula and Graham Ferry aquifers.\n49\n   \nThere are four public wells located within Rotten Bayou Watershed (See Table 2).  It is unclear \nhow much of the population is supplied by private well, although it is estimated that 38% of the \nGulf region’s population is serviced by private wells.\n50\n  The earliest record of a water well within \nthe watershed is for a domestic well drilled in 1925.  Through the 1980’s the number of wells \ndrilled remained steady, but have since declined.\n51\n \n \nTable 2: Public Wells in Rotten Bayou Watershed \nPERMIT # OWNER_NAME AQUIFER DATE DRILLED \nMS-GW-12542 DIAMONDHEAD WATER AND SEWER DISTRICT UPPER PASCAGOULA 9/1/1971 \nMS-GW-14652 DIAMONDHEAD WATER AND SEWER DISTRICT \nLOWER GRAHAM \nFERRY 10/1/1993 \nMS-GW-16560 DIAMONDHEAD WATER AND SEWER DISTRICT LOWER PASCAGOULA 1/26/2009 \nMS-GW-16561 DIAMONDHEAD WATER AND SEWER DISTRICT LOWER PASCAGOULA 4/14/2009 \n \nSource: Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Land and Water Resources. 2014 \n \nThe wells in Rotten Bayou are supplied by the Graham Ferry and Pascagoula aquifers.  There are \nrelatively few notable concerns related to water quantity and quality associated with these \naquifers.  The Graham Ferry and Pascagoula aquifers tend to be higher in iron and manganese \nwhich can affect the flavor and color of the water.\n52\n  The Mississippi Department of Health \nmonitors the water quality for the public water supply wells and all public wells are currently \ncompliant for volatile organic chemicals, synthetic organic chemicals and nitrate \nconcentration.\n53\n   \nThe Graham Ferry and Pascagoula aquifers are almost entirely fresh water, but potentially have \nmore contact with surface waters from the Gulf of Mexico or estuarine waters in coastal areas.  \nThe danger of saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers is an important concern in the watershed.  \nA study done by MDEQ in 2002 found that while salt concentrations in the well water in the area \nare naturally higher, they have not increased at a rate that would provide evidence of saltwater \nintrusion.  The study also found that saltwater intrusion is unlikely due to extraction of \ngroundwater in the deeper confined aquifers.\n54\n  The deeper sands of the aquifer system are \nrecharged at their outcrop, significantly north of Rotten Bayou Watershed.  The shallower areas \nof the system, however, can by impacted directly by actions or development within the \nwatershed.\n55\n \n \n \n \n27\n\n2.4.2 Water Conservation \nThe main factor affecting groundwater quantity in the area is the amount of water being \npumped from the aquifers.  MDEQ’s Office of Land and Water Resources considers the \npopulation sparse and the groundwater abundant in Rotten Bayou Watershed.  They also \nacknowledge the existence of many smaller aquifers that could be available for use, but have \nnever been produced due to lack of demand.\n56\n  The Gulf Region Water and Wastewater Plan, \nhowever, notes that Hancock and Harrison counties all project “steady increases in water \ndemands that cannot be met by current water supply, treatment, and distribution \ninfrastructure.” The improved infrastructure is being planned and implemented based on the \nprojected 2025 demand.\n \n57\n \nAt the present time no effluent water is being utilized for irrigation purposes.  There are, \nhowever, several opportunities to use effluent for irrigation especially in Diamondhead including \non the existing golf courses and new ball fields being constructed by the Diamondhead Property \nOwners Association off Noma Drive.\n58\n \n \n2.4.3 Access and Recreation \nThe coast and its upland waterways provide the opportunity for a wide range of recreational \nactivities.  In a public opinion survey conducted in the Southern Mississippi Planning and \nDevelopment District on 65 outdoor recreational activities, nine out of the 45 most popular \nwere water related. The most popular activities include fishing, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, and \ntubing.\n59\n  Rotten Bayou, however, has no designated public access sites where people can go to \nrecreate on or near the bayou.  Hancock County, in general has significantly fewer water-related \naccess sites as compared to the other coastal counties in Mississippi (See Table 3).  Lack of \naccess to Rotten Bayou and its tributaries, is a likely contributor to an existing disconnect \nbetween residents of and visitors to Rotten Bayou Watershed and the health of the local \nwaterways. \n \nTable 3: Public Water Access Sites and Amenities of Mississippi Coastal Counties \n \nSource: Ohio State University. (2012). Mississippi Gulf Coast Water Assessment. Water Assessment. Pg 41. \n \n28\n\nCurrently the only way the public can access Rotten Bayou is via the boat launch at \nDiamondhead Marina and by traveling a considerable distance up the Jourdan River into Rotten \nBayou.  While there is fairly limited opportunity to offer public access sites along Rotten Bayou \nas it is primarily bordered by private, residential land, there are, however, several options that \nare being explored through this planning process.  Increasing the number of water access points \nalong Rotten Bayou and in Hancock County, in general, would be beneficial along several lines.  \nFirst, when coupled with educational signage, these access sites could serve to connect people \nwith their waterways and increase environmental stewardship.  In addition, nature-based \nrecreation is a growing market in south Mississippi and responding to this growing demand \nwould likely prove beneficial both in terms of economic development and property values. \n \n2.4.4 Wildlife and Fisheries \nThe Watersheds support a broad diversity of wildlife.  Mississippi National Heritage Inventory \nkeeps a database of critical species known as species of \"special concern\".  Several of the species \nidentified as being of “special concern” and possibly in Hancock and/or Harrison Counties are \nlisted as threatened (See Appendix B: Mississippi National Heritage Inventory).  After reviewing \nthe list, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office in Hancock County advised that the Gulf \nSturgeon, listed “threatened” nationally and “endangered” statewide, is not present in Rotten \nBayou.  They added that there is a possibility that Gopher Tortoise, listed “threatened” \nnationally and “endangered” statewide, is present in the upland areas of the watershed and that \nthe Pearl Darter, listed as a “candidate” nationally and “endangered” statewide, is present in \nRotten Bayou, although there have not been any reported sightings.\n60\n \n \n2.4.5 Designated Use Classifications and Water Quality Standards \nRotten Bayou’s beneficial use is designated as “Fish and Wildlife” and is intended for fishing and \nfor maintaining waterways for the support of fish, aquatic life, and wildlife.\n61\n Waters that meet \nthe Fish and Wildlife Criteria are also considered suitable for secondary contact recreation \ndefined as “incidental contact with the water during activities such as wading, fishing, and \nboating, that are not likely to result in full body immersion”.\n62\n \nApplicable water quality standards included DO concentrations maintained at a daily average of \nnot less than 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l) with an instantaneous minimum of not less than 4.0 \nmg/l.\n63\n Water quality standard for nutrients for tributaries of the St. Louis Bay are further \ndefined as follows: \nWaters shall be free from materials attributable to municipal, industrial, agricultural or \nother discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render \nthe waters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or \nadversely affect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the water for any \ndesignated use.\n64\n \nIn addition to the thresholds adopted by MDEQ and directly applicable to the Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Implementation Plan, there are several other proposed thresholds that are \nconsidered in this planning work (See Table 4).  The State of Mississippi, for example, has \n29\n\ndeveloped draft numeric nutrient thresholds for non-tidal streams and rivers to protect aquatic \nlife uses in Mississippi. The recommended thresholds for TN in southeast Mississippi rivers and \nstreams ranges from 0.31 to 0.68 mg/l, depending on the approach.  The proposed threshold for \nTP ranges from 0.01 to 0.05 mg/l, depending on the approach.\n65\n  \nIn addition, the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA), under the direction of MDEQ, completed a \nstudy of sources and effects of nutrients as a basis for protection of estuarine and near-coastal \nwaters for St. Louis Bay.\n66\n Based on empirical and mechanistic modeling results, the preliminary \nannual geometric mean threshold recommendations are 0.6 to 0.8 mg/l for TN and 0.06 to 0.08 \nmg/l for TP. \n \nTable 4: Various Targets and Thresholds for Tributaries to St. Louis Bay and for St. Louis Bay \n \nSource: Anchor QEA, LLC. Prepared for Land Trust of the Mississippi Coastal Plain. (2014). Rotten Bayou Water Quality \nAssessment. Pg. 3. \n \nIt is important to note that monitoring and water quality standards for “Fish and Wildlife” are \nnot intended to support contact recreation such as swimming and water skiing.  While there are \ncurrently no public access sites on Rotten Bayou, there are private land owners that have docks \ndirectly on Rotten Bayou and report regularly engaging in what would be considered contact \nrecreation in the waterway.  While the number of residential lots on Rotten Bayou appears to be \nrelatively few, anecdotal evidence purports that more people might actually be swimming in the \nbayou than suggested by the number of lots.  In a survey of participants in the Watershed \nHarmony program through the Hancock County Library System’s Summer Reading Program, 10 \nout of 30 respondents reported that their family currently swims in Rotten Bayou and 19 said \nthey would like to swim in Rotten Bayou if given the opportunity.  Based on existing interest and \nconcerns of residents around water quality suitability in Rotten Bayou for recreational activities \nsuch as swimming, MDEQ has been monitoring pathogens at two locations in Rotten Bayou as \npart of the Rotten Bayou watershed planning effort.  Results are further discussed in Section \n2.4.6.  \n \n30\n\n2.4.6 Current Status of Water Bodies \nNutrients \nUSGS has been monitoring data the following four gauges within Rotten Bayou watershed since \n2012.  The first stage of monitoring was completed in 2014.  Monitoring has since been \nsuspended to allow for BMP installation.  Once the grant-funded BMPs are installed, MDEQ and \nUSGS will re-instate monitoring activities in an effort to show water quality improvements.

Figure 1. \n31\n\nAnalysis of the data, however, is not projected to be completed until 2016.  The Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Implantation Plan to address the TMDL in Rotten Bayou is being funded through \nSeptember 2015.  As a result of this mismatch in project timing, Land Trust for the Mississippi \nCoastal Plain procured the services of Anchor QEA to assess the draft and provisional data from \nUSGS for use in the Watershed Implementation Plan. \nAs part of their assessment, Anchor QEA downloaded flow and TN/TP concentration data from \nthe USGS website on September and October 2014 and compared the concentrations to all \nthree thresholds discussed in Section 2.4.5.  It is important to note that three of the gauges are \nfreshwater (i.e. non-tidal), while the gauge in Diamondhead is tidally influenced.  Because of \nthis, it is impossible to discern the influence of Rotten Bayou Watershed from St. Louis Bay on \nnutrient concentrations detected at this gauge.\n67\n   \nFew TN and TP measurements from 2012 to 2014 exceeded the nutrient TMDL thresholds at the \nfreshwater gauges (Figures 9 and 10). For TN, none of the measurements exceeded the nutrient \nTMDL threshold with the exception of one measurement on July 18, 2012, at 4:15 pm at \n0248166310 Mill Creek at Fenton. For TP, 8% and 4% of samples at 02481661 Tributary to Bayou \nLaSalle near Vidalia and at 0248166310 Mill Creek at Fenton, respectively, exceeded the TMDL \nthreshold; these exceedances appear to have been during storm events. Only one sample taken \nat 02481663 Rotten Bayou near Fenton exceeded the TP TMDL threshold; this sample was \ncollected on July 12, 2012.\n68\n \n \nFigure 9: Temporal of Total Nitrogen Concentration at Three Freshwater Gauges near Rotten \nBayou \n \nSource: Anchor QEA, LLC.

Figure 3. \n \nSome TN and TP concentrations from the freshwater gauges were higher than the draft revised \nstream nutrient thresholds for southeast Mississippi.  Thirteen percent and 7% of the samples \nexceeded the TN threshold at 02481661 Tributary to Bayou LaSalle near Vidalia and at \n0248166310 Mill Creek at Fenton, respectively.  These samples, however, appear to have been \ntaken during storm events as multiple samples were taken on a single day. No TN measurement \nat 02481663 Rotten Bayou near Fenton exceeded the threshold. A similar pattern of \nexceedances is observed for TP data.\n69\n \nThe St. Louis Bay thresholds were developed based on tidally influenced monitoring data in St. \nLouis Bay. Table 5 summarizes annual geometric means of TN and TP for the tidal gauge near \nRotten Bayou from 2012 to 2014. At this gauge, the annual geometric means exceeded the St. \nLouis Bay thresholds for both TN and TP in 2013 and 2014.\n70\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n33\n\n \nTable 5: Annual Geometric Means at the Tidal Gauge at Diamondhead \n \nSource: Anchor QEA, LLC. (2014). Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment. \n \nBased on analysis of the best available data, it was concluded that the TN and TP concentrations \nmeasured at the three freshwater gauges in Rotten Bayou Watershed are generally below or \nnear the various Mississippi nutrient threshold concentrations with the exception of data \ncollected during a few storm events in 2012 and 2014.  The TN and TP concentrations from the \ntidal gauge in Diamondhead exceeded the thresholds in two of the three monitoring years.\n71\n \nLimitations of the data analyzed for the Rotten Bayou Watershed Implementation Plan are \ndiscussed in the full report. See Appendix C: Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment.  Based on \nthese preliminary findings the report recommended focusing BMPs for controlling runoff and \nstormwater in the drainage areas upland of the Diamondhead and Mill Creek gauges.\n72\n \n \nPathogens \nAt the request of the Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership’s Steering Committee and learning \nthat Rotten Bayou is being used for primary contact recreation including swimming and jet \nskiing, MDEQ began testing for pathogens including Fecal Coliform and E. Coli in the fall of 2014.  \nTwo locations were chosen for testing. The first location was the bridge at Rotten Bayou and \nKiln-Delisle Road, just north of the confluence with Mill Creek.  This site was chosen to give \nsome indication of the impacts of nonfunctioning septic system concentrations in western \nHarrison County (See Figure 11).  This section of Rotten Bayou is non-tidal.  The second location \nwas a private pier about three miles up Rotten Bayou.  This section of the bayou is tidal, but is \none of the main areas where residents are swimming. \nThe first set of testing was done between September 22 and October 8, 2014.  This was during \nthe “non-contact” recreational season when people are less likely to be coming in direct contact \nwith the water.  The second set of testing was done between March 18 and April 7, 2015; the \n“contact” recreational season when people are more likely to be in direct contact with the \nwater.  As described in Section 2.4.5, Rotten Bayou currently has a “Fish and Wildlife” \nclassification.  For this classification, the allowable concentrations of pathogens are a geomean \nof 200 colonies/100 ml for the contact season and 2000 colonies/100 ml for the non-contact \n34\n\nseason, as well as 400 colonies/100 ml 10% of the time for the contact season and 4000 \ncolonies/100 ml 10% of the time for the non-contact season. \nA Summary of results of the first year of pathogen testing in Rotten Bayou are displayed in Table \n6.  Results from the bridge location were above the standard during the contact season based \non both the geomean and the 10% rule.  While this level of pathogen testing does not \ndistinguish between waste from humans, domestic animals or wildlife, the results could be an \nindication that there is still a problem with nonfunctioning septic systems in western Harrison \nCounty (See Figure 11).  Results from the pier location were under the standard for the contact \nseason based on the geomean, but above the standard based on the 10% rule.  Both standards \nneed to be met to be in compliance.  Because this section of the bayou is tidal, the source or \nsources of the pathogens could be upstream or downstream.  While the discharge location for \nDiamondhead Water and Sewer District is below Interstate 10 and just south of Rotten Bayou, \nthis cannot be ruled out as a potential source of pathogens further upstream because of the \ntidal nature of the bayou. Both locations were under the standard for both the geomean and \n10% rule for the non-contact season. \n \nTable 6: Results from Pathogen Testing in Rotten Bayou Compared to Water Quality Standards \nfor Waterways with a “Fish and Wildlife” Designation \nLocation Season Geomean Standard 10% Standard \nBridge Contact 311 200 889 400 \nPier Contact 132 200 1062 400 \nBridge Non-contact 196 2000 439 4000 \nPier Non-contact 145 2000 865 4000 \n \nSource: MDEQ (2015) \n \nWhile both locations exceeded standards for pathogens during the contact season, MDEQ is \nhesitant to draw any standing conclusions based on the full data set.  Results appeared to be \nhighly variable in response to rainfall and consistent impairment usually results in levels of Fecal \nColiform at least one, if not two, orders of magnitude higher.  MDEQ is considering monitoring \nat both sites on Rotten Bayou for another year to see if results are any more conclusive.\n73\n  If \nconsistent impairment is determined a TMDL for pathogens may be ordered for the bayou. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n35\n\nFigure 11: Nonfunctioning Septic Systems in Rotten Bayou Watershed \n \n \n36\n\nErosion/sedimentation \nErosion and sedimentation appear to be major stressors affecting water quality in Rotten Bayou.  \nWhile no streambank erosion rates are available for the watershed, several smaller engineering \nstudies have been done that cite erosion and sedimentation as primary contributors to \nreductions in hydraulic capacity.  Of particular significance is a study done by Compton \nEngineering in 2012 detailing erosion and sedimentation in the western portion of \nDiamondhead that drains into Devil’\ns Elbow, an oxbow feature of Rotten Bayou.  The report \nnotes that “In recent years Devil’s Elbow has filled with sediment downstream of the discharge \npoint of the primary drainage ditch for western Diamondhead and investigation indicates that it \nwas cleaning and clearing work conducted on this drainage ditch (post Hurricane Katrina) that \ncaused erosion along the ditch and down-gradient deposition to occur.”\n74\n  The report \ndocuments specific source of erosion and suggestions for preventing, treating and controlling \nthis type of nonpoint source pollution.  In addition to areas immediately draining to Devil’s \nElbow, many other areas through Diamondhead and Hancock and Harrison Counties are \nsusceptible to erosion and contributing to sedimentation in the watershed.  See Figure 12. \nFigure 12: Erosion in Rotten Bayou Watershed \n   \n    \nSource: Kelsey Johnson. Photos taken between March and November 2014 \n37\n\n \n2.4.7 Sources of Pollutions \nCurrently there are no municipal or industrial facilities within the watershed that are permitted \nunder the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.  As such, most of the pollution noted \nabove can be attributed to nonpoint sources.  The Diamondhead Water and Sewer District does \nhave a permitted discharge location downstream of Rotten Bayou and north of Interstate 10.  \nDue to the tidal influence into Rotten Bayou the effects of this discharge should be more closely \nconnected with planning in the watershed in the future. \nNutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus often come from fertilizers and pesticides used in \nagriculture and on residential lawns and gardens.  According to the Mississippi State University \nExtension Service, there are relatively few agriculture practices and no commercial row crop \nventures that would require the most use of fertilizers and pesticides within the watershed.\n75\n  \nThis seems to be supported by the relatively low TN and TP concentrations from the gauges near \nVidalia and Fenton that respond to water draining from the upper and most rural parts of the \nwatershed.  TN and TP concentrations are higher at the Diamondhead and Mill Creek gauges \nthat includes more dense residential and some commercial land uses, as well as two golf \ncourses.  Home pesticide and fertilizer use, as well as use for golf course maintenance are more \nlikely to be significant contributors to nutrient loads in Rotten Bayou.  Again, it is important to \nnote that the Diamondhead gauge is tidally influenced and so it is currently not clear what \nnutrients are coming from development and the golf course versus the St. Louis Bay. \nPathogens such as Fecal Coliform and E. Coli can come from waste from humans from failing \nseptic systems or discharge from sewer treatment plants, domestic animal waste such as from \npets or livestock, or wildlife.  Basic levels of testing do not provide enough data to determine the \nspecific source, however additional testing can be done that will give a better indication of \nwhere the pathogens are coming from.  If after further testing pathogens are determined to be \na significant problem in Rotten Bayou, more fine-tuned testing to determine sources may be \nwarranted.  Regardless, potential sources such as concentrations of reported nonfunctioning \nseptic in western Harrison County, discharge from Diamondhead Water and Sewer District and \nwaste from pets and livestock that is not properly disposed of or controlled should be \naddressed. \nVarious activities throughout the watershed seem to be intensifying erosion and sedimentation.  \nNew residential and commercial construction that exposes soil without adequately managing for \nthese changes both during and after construction can have a significant impact on the hydrology \ndownstream.  Most of the stormwater system in Rotten Bayou watershed utilizes swales and \nditches as opposed to drains and pipes.  Drainage swales can be much better for water quality \nwhen properly maintained because they allow for infiltration and can help slow the flow of \nwater.  However, when these ditches are cleared or cleaned in ways that remove vegetation and \nexpose soils, they become sources of sediments that end up in the waterways.  The use of \nrecreational vehicles such as ATVs near waterways is a popular pasttime on the coast.  When \nsoils are disturbed near waterways and trails are not properly reinforced excess sediment can \nend up in the waterways hindering flow, navigability and critical habitat.  An example of this is \non the utility easement in Diamondhead that abuts Rotten Bayou off Bayou Drive just south of \nthe confluence with Bayou La Terre. \n38\n\nWhile litter is not specifically monitored within the watershed it is a very visible source of \npollution that ends up in the stormwater system and waterways.  Litter is visible on the sides of \nthe roads and drainage ditches throughout most of the county portions of the watershed.  The \nmain sources appear to be loose debris from pick-up truck beds, purposeful disposal of litter \nfrom vehicles, unsecured garbage placed roadside for collection and illegal dumping of larger \nitems.  See Figure 13.  There is very little litter in the residential area of Diamondhead and the \nDiamondhead Property Owners Association’s maintenance crew regularly picks up any visible \nlitter on their rounds in this area.  There is more visible garbage in the commercial area of \nDiamondhead just north of Interstate 10.  Currently there is no curbside recycling in Hancock \nCounty or Diamondhead which may be a hindrance to improving the anti-litter mentality in \nthose areas. \n \nFigure 12: Sources of Litter in Rotten Bayou Watershed. \n     \nSource: Kelsey Johnson. Photos taken between March and November 2014 \n \n2.5 Key Findings: Challenges and Opportunities \nThe following section summarizes the important findings from the watershed assessment that inform \nthe strategies and best management practices identified in Section 3: Management and Monitoring \nPlan. \nHistorical Context \nTwo significant historical events that affected hydrology in the watershed are the heavy logging in \narea that resulted in erosion and sedimentation and the development of Diamondhead which added \na significant amount of impervious surfaces and human activity. \nCurrent and Future Land Use \nThe vast majority of the land in the watershed is and will likely continue to be privately owned, \nsingle-family residential.  There is still some potential for commercial development throughout the \nwatershed and approximately one square mile of remaining developable land in the City of \nDiamondhead. \nHydrology \n39\n\nTying Best Management Practices with soil suitability based on hydrology will improve the \neffectiveness and efficiency of watershed planning and management in Rotten Bayou Watershed. \nWetlands \nWetland protection, including upland wetlands, and the conservation of priority lands as advised by \nthe Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain’s Conservation Mapping database will be critical to \nensuring the long-term hydraulic functions of the watershed given the likelihood of future \ndevelopment and effects of climate change. \nAccess and Recreation \nLack of access to Rotten Bayou and its tributaries, is a likely contributor to an existing disconnect \nbetween residents and visitors of Rotten Bayou Watershed and the health of the local waterways. \nNutrients \nTN and TP concentrations at the three freshwater gauges are generally below or near the various \nMississippi nutrient threshold concentrations with the exception of data collected during a few \nstorm events.  The TN and TP concentrations from the tidal gauge in Diamondhead exceeded the \nthresholds in two of the three monitoring years. The report recommended focusing on \npreserving/restoring streamside buffers and installing BMPs for controlling runoff and stormwater in \nthe drainage areas upland of the Diamondhead and Mill Creek gauges. \nPathogens \nConcentrations of pathogens in Rotten Bayou appear to be a concern, although further testing is \nneeded to make any real conclusions.  Concentrations on the bayou at Kiln-Delisle Road, just north \nof the confluence with Mill Creek, appear to be of greater concern.  Concentrations of reported \nnonfunctioning septic systems in western Harrison County may be a significant contributor to these \nhigher concentrations.  In addition, while the discharge location for Diamondhead Water and Sewer \nDistrict is downstream from the second testing site and just outside the watershed, it cannot be \nruled out as a contributor to spikes in concentrations of pathogens in this tidal section of the bayou. \nErosion and Sedimentation \nErosion and sedimentation appear to be major stressors affecting water quality.  Main sources \ninclude cleaned/cleared drainage ditches, new construction and informal trails used by recreational \nvehicles such as ATVs. \nLitter \nLitter is a very visible problem throughout the watershed.  The main sources appear to be loose \ndebris from pick-up truck beds, purposeful disposal of litter from vehicles, unsecured garbage placed \nroadside for collection and illegal dumping of larger items.   \n \n \n \n \n \n40\n\nSection 3: Management and Monitoring Plan \n \n3.1 Watershed Management Actions \nBest Management Practices (BMPs) are techniques used to manage and improve stormwater quantity \nand quality.  The goal of BMPs is to reduce or eliminate contaminants collected by stormwater as it \nmoves into streams and rivers.  Best management practices can be structural (i.e. permeable paving, \nliving shorelines or bioretention areas) or nonstructural (i.e. wetland conservation or policies and \nordinances that require or incentivize individuals to implement measures to improve water quality or \nmanage the quantity of water coming off their property).  Section 3.1.1 gives a summary of best \nmanagement practices that have been completed during the development of the WIP while Section \n3.1.2 describes recommended best practices to be implemented in the future. \n3.1.1 Current Management Actions \nAgricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Project \nThe agricultural nonpoint source pollution project in Rotten Bayou Watershed was the result of \na partnership between the Mississippi Soil and Waters Conservation Commission, Mississippi \nDepartment of Environmental Quality, United States Environmental Protection Agency, United \nStates Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Hancock \nCounty Soil and Water Conservation District.  The primary goals of the project were: \n1. To improve water quality and protect high quality waters by demonstrating the \neconomic benefits and effectiveness of selected BMPs in targeted areas, \n2. To apply BMPs to agricultural land in the project area as to reach the desired outcome \nof reduced runoff, cattle access/nutrients to the stream and sedimentation, and \n3. To inform and educate the public about BMPs that benefit water quality. \nThe project began in September 2011 and concluded in September 2014 and resulted in the \ninstallation of a significant number of BMPs within the rural area of the watershed (See Table 7 \nand Figure 14).   Education and outreach included demonstration farms, educational field days, \npress releases and fact sheets.  Total project cost was $496,814.01.  Appendix D contains the \nfinal report for the Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Project. \n \nTable 7: Summary of Best Management Practices Installed \nBMP Number of \nPractices \nNumber of \nAcres \nTotal Tons of Soil \nSaved Per Year \nCritical Planting Area 6 10 51 \nFencing 19 24,563 ft  \nNutrient Management 12 250.5 762.7 \nPasture and Hayland Planting 2 38 144 \nHeavy Use Area Protection 3   \nTank/Trough 6   \nPond (Alternative Water Source) 14   \nWater and Sediment Control Basin 4 4 118.2 \nTotal 66 302.5 1,075.9 \n41\n\n \nDiamondhead Cardinal Golf Course \nBetween June 2014 and December 2014 a partnership consisting of Land Trust for the \nMississippi Coastal Plain, Gulf Coast Community Design Studio (GCCDS), Diamondhead Country \nClub and Property Owners Association (DPOA) and Mississippi Water Resources Research \nInstitute installed a series of BMPs on Diamondhead’s Cardinal Golf Course including a dry swale \non hole one, naturalized stream segment on hole two, and native planting area on hole six.  Cory \nGallo, Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture at Mississippi State University, working \nthrough the Mississippi Water Resources Research Institute, designed the dry swale at hole two \nand suggested plantings for the native planting area on hole six.  Diamondhead Country Club \nand Property Owners Association was able to implement both of these BMPs with their own \nstaff and resources. \nThe stream naturalization at hole two was a more involved project and GCCDS worked closely \nwith Diamondhead Country Club and Property Owners Association staff on this project.  In \nDecember 2015, GCCDS staff worked alongside DPOA staff to not only do the stream \nrestoration, but to train the DPOA staff in techniques including terracing the streambank, \ninstalling erosion control, and planting and maintaining the native vegetation.  Educational \nsignage designed by GCCDS was installed at the tee box of each hole where a BMP was installed.  \nProject square footage for all three BMPs was 36,640 sq ft and is estimated to treat a runoff \nvolume of 19,125 cu ft for the 90\nth\n percentile rain event.  Total project budget including design \nwork, materials and educational signage was $8,600.  Maintenance costs are estimated to be \n$550-$600 per month during the growing season (8-9 months of the year) and projected to \ndecrease significantly once vegetation is established.  See Appendix E for design work and \nbefore and after photographs. \nDuck Pond \nThe steering committee for the Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership selected the area adjacent \nto the overflow of the duck pond at the front of Diamondhead as the site for a demonstration \nproject.  The property is owned by the Diamondhead Property Owners Association and open to \nthe public. \nThe project includes a stream naturalization, native plantings and multiple levels of filtration \nthat will accomplish the following: \n improve water quality and decrease sedimentation downstream;  \n decrease stormwater velocity and erosion of the stream and around the overflow; \n provide habitat for butterflies and songbirds; \n and provide a park atmosphere for the community to enjoy. \nLandscaping will include native vegetation and educational signage at an existing deck overlook \nwill inform community members how they might use similar species of plants at their own \nhomes.  Work on the project was be completed between July 20 and September 10, 2015. See \nAppendix F for project designs and details \n \n42\n\nFigure 14: Agricultural BMPs Installed During the Project Period \n \nSource: Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission (2015). Map by GCCDS. \n43\n\nFigure 15: Urban BMPs Installed During the Project Period \n \nSource: GCCDS. \n44\n\n3.1.2 Planned Management Actions  \nPrevious sections in the WIP have described challenges and opportunities facing Rotten Bayou \nWatershed (Section 2.4.7 Sources of Pollutions and Section 2.5 Key Findings: Challenges and \nOpportunities) and identified the goals and objectives for restoring the watershed (Section 1.2.4 \nGoals and Objectives).  The following management strategies are organized around these \nchallenges and opportunities and are recommended based on their ability to address the goals \nfor restoring and enhancing Rotten Bayou Watershed.   A full listing of potential management \nstrategies recommended for Rotten Bayou Watershed including responsible parties, potential \nfunders, estimated costs and a recommended implementation timeline is included in Appendix \nH: Management Actions. \nRotten Bayou Watershed Partnership \nContinued support from Steering Committee members and the committee members’ ability to \nsecure commitments of both time and resources from the stakeholders and/or entities they \nrepresent will be the difference between success and failure for the Rotten Bayou Watershed \nPartnership and Watershed Implementation Plan.  The active participation of the Steering \nCommittee, including the Technical Advisory Committee and Education and Outreach \nCommittee, has contributed greatly to all that has been accomplished in Rotten Bayou \nWatershed to date.  Up to this point, however, the meetings and activities of the committees \nhave been coordinated by a paid facilitator.  According to a study of watershed management \norganizations conducted at the University of Oregon, “many [watershed groups] were unable to \nsustain themselves once the sponsoring agency withdrew its provisional leadership” and that \n“volunteer coordinators, or part-time coordinators loaned from partner agencies, are \ninadequate to maintain effective group leadership.”\n76\n In the short term, the Steering Committee \nwill nominate a Rotten Bayou Watershed Coordinator to continue to facilitate regular meetings \nand activities of the Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership and oversee progress on the Rotten \nBayou Watershed Implementation Plan.  The Steering Committee should also look into funding \noptions for a paid leader for the Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership.  The Mississippi \nDepartment of Environmental Quality should consider funding a watershed coordinator grant \nprogram similar to what was done in California through the Department of Conservation.\n77\n \n \nData Gaps \n Visual Survey \nA thorough visual survey of the waterways in Rotten Bayou Watershed would help \nidentify specific locations where streamside BMPs are most needed.  A visual survey \ncould include the following: \n  Number of Sites with Buffers Present \nNumber of Sites with Active Erosion \nNumber of Sites with Livestock Access \nNumber of Sites with Hardened Shorelines \nNumber of Sites with Visible Evidence of Eutrophication \n45\n\nClimb Community Development Corporation’s Restore Corps could be employed to \nconduct the survey.  See Section 3.3. \n Erosion and Sediment Delivery Rates \nBased on visual surveys of the watershed and anecdotal information from longtime \nresidents, sedimentation in Rotten Bayou appears to be a growing concern.  Main \nsources appear to be cleaned/cleared drainage ditches, new construction and informal \ntrails used by recreational vehicles such as ATVs.  Methodologies such as semi-\nquantitative models developed for erosion and sediment yield assessments at the basin \nscale can be used to more narrowly define sources of erosion and sediment.  After \nsource and quantity are identified, a sediment delivery procedure can be used to \ndetermine how sediment is being naturally transported from the source of erosion to a \nspecific location in the waterway.  Employing such a model in Rotten Bayou Watershed \ncould help identify where to target BMPs so that more significant results can be realized \nwith fewer investment dollars. \n Primary Source(s) of Pathogens \nWhile it is speculated that some pathogen loading in Rotten Bayou may be a result of \nnonfunctioning septic systems (See Figure 11), current available data does not allow for \nidentifying specific impacts due to septic systems.   Additional bacteria monitoring may \nbe helpful in delineating inputs from septic systems versus wildlife.  In addition, the \nmost recent survey of septic systems in Rotten Bayou Watershed was conducted by the \nMississippi Department of Health in 2010.  It would be beneficial to update the survey in \ncoordination with outreach and education efforts to inform septic system owners of \nproper maintenance procedures. \n  \nPriority Projects \n  County Demonstration Project \nEarly in 2014, the Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership began working with Sacred \nHeart Catholic Church located at the top of Rotten Bayou Watershed.  The church is \nprominent in the community, draws its membership from the watershed, and was \nexperiencing problems with stormwater runoff.  The property on which the church is \nlocated is also home to the Cursillo center which caters to members of the Catholic faith \nthroughout the region.  The church was seen not only as a potential partner in \nconducting education and outreach related to Rotten Bayou Watershed, but also as a \ngood location for a demonstration best management project that would be highly \nvisible to residents in the more rural areas of Harrison and Hancock Counties.   \nPlans were made to install a rain barrel at the Cursillo center near one of the church \ngardens and to construct a rain garden at the church to address a specific area where \nflooding was routinely occurring. See Appendix G for preliminary rain garden designs.  \nDue to recent changes with church leadership and poor timing related to other major \nchurch projects, the leadership at Sacred Heart Catholic Church felt they could not go \nahead with the projects at that time.  It is highly recommended that this or a similar, \n46\n\nhighly-visible demonstration project be installed in the more rural, residential part of \nthe watershed. \n  Utility Easement \nMany residents in Diamondhead are familiar with the utility easement that runs \nbetween Bayou Drive in Diamondhead and Rotten Bayou.  This section of the utility \neasement has experienced high levels of erosion due to frequent and unauthorized ATV \nuse.  The erosion appears to be negatively impacting a wetland habitat along the bayou \nand reducing the navigability of the waterway.  The Rotten Bayou Watershed \nPartnership sees stopping ATV use on the site and regrading and replanting the eroded \nlandscape as a high priority area in the watershed.   \nThe utility easement and property to the south has a very high conservation value and \ncould potentially be a tremendous asset to the community in terms of access to the \nbayou and recreation near the bayou.  Currently, Purcell Corporation owns the property \nwith the utility easement and land to the south along Rotten Bayou.  Mississippi Power \nCorporation holds the easement.  Early in 2014, the Land Trust for the Mississippi \nCoastal Plain and Gulf Coast Community Design Studio began talking with the Purcell \nCorporation and Mississippi Power about the possibility of addressing the erosion issues \nand longer term possibility of providing community access and trails.  See Appendix G.  \nAt the present time, Mississippi Power is supportive of the concept.  Purcell Corporation \ndoes not feel it is currently in the company’s best interest to allow public access or to \ndonate or sell the land for conservation purposes, but acknowledges that circumstances \nmay change in the future.  The Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership, along with the City \nof Diamondhead and the Diamondhead Country Club and Property Owners Association, \nshould continue to inquire about the status of this area and look for ways to put it into \nconservation. \n  City Hall \nThe Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership also considered demonstration projects at \nseveral locations around Diamondhead City Hall.  The city was in the midst of addressing \ndrainage issues on the north end of City Hall property.  Unfortunately, due to the \nproximity to existing housing, a section of the drainage area needed to be piped. The \ndrainage area is part of a creek that feeds directly into Rotten Bayou and there remain \nopportunities for creek restoration between the area that was piped and Rotten Bayou. \nIn addition, there are remnants of an existing trail that could be enhanced for public \nuse.  Finally, the area east of the building consistently floods during rain events and lack \nof vegetation has made the land susceptible to erosion. The space is currently not \nutilized, but has the potential to be a beautiful public area that can accommodate both \nstormwater and passive recreation.  See Appendix G. \n  Country Club Rain Garden \nThe Water Resources Research Institute, as part of their funded work listed in Section \n1.3, identified an area on the front lawn of the Diamondhead County Club located \nbetween the main building, practice putting green and golf cart parking lot that is an \nexcellent candidate for a rain garden.  Currently there is a rock garden/landscaping \nfeature in this area that is not serving any sort of drainage function.  The Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Partnership considered this area for a demonstration project because of its \n47\n\nvisibility to the public; ability to filter water coming off the club roof, putting green and \nparking lot; and opportunity for educational signage that could also point towards other \nBMPs installed on the Cardinal Golf Course during the project period.  While this project \nwas not undertaken during the grant period, it remains a worthwhile and attainable \nproject.  See Appendix G. \n \nConservation and Restoration \n  Conservation \nAs part of the Conservation Legacy Project, the Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal \nPlain has a map of Potential Conservation Lands that is a model of the suitability of land \nfor conservation based on ranked environmental and land use conditions including \nwetlands, hydrological soil groups, flood zones, elevation/slope, upland forest and \nimportant ecosystems.  Areas that are in Rotten Bayou watershed and currently \nundeveloped were identified as being relatively high priority areas (See Figure 7) in \nterms of conservation and should be considered in planning and management strategies \nfor Rotten Bayou Watershed.  See Section 2.3.5.  The LTMCP should continue to work \nwith the City of Diamondhead, the Diamondhead Country Club and Property Owners \nAssociation, Purcell Corporation and private landowners within the watershed to \nacquire property or easements that will protect critical land within the watershed. \n  Living Shorelines and Streamside Buffers \nStreamside buffers and living shorelines are very effective in improving water quality \nand habitat along waterways.  A living shoreline describes a natural approach to \nshoreline stabilization that reduces erosion while preserving or creating habitat along \nthe shoreline.  The recommended visual survey of the waterways in Rotten Bayou \nWatershed would give a clearer indication of the extent of existing streamside buffers \nand hardened shorelines.  Depending on the results of this survey, outreach and \neducation should be conducted targeting individual property owners.  Results of these \nefforts would be further enhanced by some type of incentive program for homeowners \nwho willingly implement BMPs along the shorelines.   \n  Dredging and Beneficial Use \nCurrently there are several locations along Rotten Bayou where dredging is desired for \nincreased navigability and/or necessary for habitat restoration.  One location is Devil’s \nElbow (See Section 2.4.6) and the other is where the utility easement off Bayou Drive in \nDiamondhead intersects the bayou.  The Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership should \nstay informed of any projects proposing dredging along Rotten Bayou and, where \ndredging is determined necessary, ensure that the dredge material is used for beneficial \nuses including development of wetland habitats. \n \n \n \n \n48\n\nRecreation and Ecotourism \n Bayou Access \nRotten Bayou and its tributaries are almost entirely bordered by private property.  With \nvery few opportunities for the public to access or even view Rotten Bayou, it is difficult \nfor watershed residents and visitors to understand their connection to this important \nwaterway.  There are a few remaining opportunities to provide access to the bayou or \nallow for recreation near the bayou.  One such example is the utility easement running \nfrom Bayou Drive in Diamondhead, west to Rotten Bayou.  See Priority Projects in \nSection 3.1.2 Planned Management Actions.  The feasibility of this project is contingent \non the willingness of current landowners.  There are also several other residential \nproperties along Rotten Bayou that are prone to flooding and either have not been \ndeveloped or have not been redeveloped since Hurricane Katrina.  These properties \nshould be considered for conservation and as possible access points to the bayou. \nBlueway \nRotten Bayou is navigable by kayak from the Jourdan River up to Kiln-Delisle Road; \nabout 6 stream miles.  It is a beautiful and often secluded waterway that would make an \nexcellent addition to the Mississippi Gulf Coasts’ growing list of blueways.  Rotten \nBayou’s designation as a blueway would forward the goals of this WIP by increasing \naccess to and awareness of Rotten Bayou.  Increasing access and awareness is critical to \nimproving water quality in Rotten Bayou because many people in the watershed \ncurrently do not feel a connection to the bayou because of lack of access due to private \nownership along the bayou.  Increasing access points as discussed above will be \nimportant to Rotten Bayou becoming a successful blueway.  Currently, unless one owns \nproperty on the bayou, the only ways to access Rotten Bayou are from Jordan River \nlaunches, Diamondhead Marina or roadway overpasses. \n \nWaste and Wastewater \n Nonfunctioning Septic Systems \nAccording to a survey done by the Mississippi Department of Health (MSDH) in 2010, \npockets of nonfunctioning septic systems remain in Rotten Bayou Watershed.  See \nFigure 11.  The most significant clusters are in the western part of Harrison County.  \nFollowing Hurricane Katrina, sewer and water districts across coastal Mississippi were \nable to tie-in many areas that were previously on septic systems, primarily using funds \nthrough the Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP).  Western Harrison County was \nable to tie in areas just north of Interstate 10, but currently does not have funding to \nconnect any areas still reported as nonfunctioning.\n78\n  In the absence of funding to tie-in \nadditional areas on septic systems, an educational campaign about the risks of \nnonfunctioning septic systems and proper maintenance should target areas in the \nwatershed where high concentrations of septic systems remain.   \n Diamondhead Water and Sewer District \nDiamondhead Water and Sewer District is in the process of relocating its discharge site \nand wastewater treatment plant.  While the discharge point for Diamondhead Water \n49\n\nand Sewer District is south of the watershed, due to the tidal influence into Rotten \nBayou the effects of this discharge should be more closely connected with planning in \nthe watershed in the future.  There is also an opportunity for the Diamondhead Water \nand Sewer District to work with the DPOA and City of Diamondhead so that effluent can \nbe dispersed on land for irrigation of the Diamondhead Golf Courses and other \nappropriate sites. \n  \nLitter \n Curbside recycling \nHarrison County currently operates a curbside recycling program. Prior to Hurricane \nKatrina, Hancock County also had a curbside recycling program, but residents must now \nbring their recyclable materials to drop-off centers in order to have them recycled.  This \nadded inconvenience can be a deterrent to waste management best practices.  The \nHancock County Solid Waste Authority and local jurisdictions, in collaboration with the \nMississippi Recycling Coalition, should work towards reinstating and promoting curbside \nrecycling in Hancock County.   \n Trash Catches in Commercial Area \nThe majority of the drainage system in the watershed is made up of swales and ditches, \nbut there are a few areas, especially in the commercial area of Diamondhead, that have \ncurb and gutter.  Litter in these areas can easily be washed down the storm drains and \ninto waterways.  Trash catches or drain guards installed at the catch basins would help \nprevent litter from entering the waterways. \n Street sweeping \nRoadway litter and debris are prominent throughout the watershed and easily make \ntheir way into waterways through the drainage system.  Regular street sweeping should \nbe coordinated through the county and city road maintenance departments.  \n Keep Diamondhead Beautiful Extension \nKeep Diamondhead Beautiful (KDB) became a registered affiliate of Keep America \nBeautiful in 2014.  The mission of the organization is focused on “beautifying the City of \nDiamondhead, involving the community in the beautification efforts, continuing to \nsupport the sense of pride that already exists in the City of Diamondhead by \nencouraging the citizens and the administration to provide a clean and litter free \nenvironment, by helping to develop landscaping and maintenance plans and projects for \nthe safety and beauty of the City of Diamondhead.”   \nThe City of Diamondhead is relatively litter-free, except for some litter around fast food \nlocations and shopping centers.  Roadway litter and illegal dumbing appear to be more \nof a concern outside of city limits, however, there are no Keep America Beautiful \naffiliates active in areas of the watershed outside of Diamondhead.  Since Diamondhead \nhas relatively few litter problems and the county areas surrounding Diamondhead are \nessentially a gateway to the city, it would be beneficial for KDB to extend its mission and \nreach to include other areas in Rotten Bayou Watershed outside of city limits. \n50\n\nAdopt-a-Roadway \nCurrently, adopt-a-highway programs are administered by the federal and state \ndepartments of transportation.  Eligible roadways include federal and state highways.  \nThrough these programs, public and private organizations and individuals agree to clean \na one to two mile segment of the highway a certain number of times per year.  In \nexchange, dedication signage and clean-up materials are provided by the Department of \nTransportation.  These programs not only serve to clean-up roadway litter, but also help \ndeter litter in the first place.  Drivers and pedestrians that see Adopt-a-Roadway signage \nand witness volunteers picking up garbage are more likely to think twice about littering \nin that area.  While there are no eligible roadways in Rotten Bayou Watershed, a similar \nprogram modeled after the Adopt-a-Highway program could help reduce roadway litter \nin critical areas of the watershed. \n \nUrban BMPs \n Nonstructural \n  Permeable paving \nCurrently, the City of Diamondhead’s zoning ordinance does not allow for \npervious paving options in commercial parking areas, loading facilities or access \ndrives.  By allowing and even encouraging the use of pervious paving options \nthe city would be furthering the environmental goals established in the 25 Year \nComprehensive Plan and taking necessary steps to protect water quality in \nRotten Bayou and the watershed.  See Appendix I: Recommended Ordinance \nChanges.    \n  Stormwater ordinance \nDiamondhead’s current stormwater ordinance is relatively vague and often not \nclear on where responsibility lies with the city or with the developer.  \nMississippi’s Water Resources Research Institute has reviewed the stormwater \nordinance and made specific recommendations for language that should be \nmodified to make the document more effective.  See Appendix I.    \n  Building code \nUnder current regulations, smaller residential lots in Diamondhead can be filled \nto elevate land which reduces the area water can be stored within the \nwatershed and may increase flood risk downstream.  A grading supplement \nshould be added to the building code to minimize fill allowed on these lots. See \nAppendix I.    \n  Coastal Technical Manual \nEffective stormwater management requires connecting the dots from policy \nimplementation to proper construction and installation of best management \npractices.  Many of the jurisdictions on the coast are looking to implement \npolicies that would allow, incentivize or require pre and post-construction best \nmanagement practices addressing stormwater runoff, but are unfamiliar with \n51\n\nsome of the technical aspects or unclear about the implications of certain \npolicies.  The State of Georgia addressed this concern and information gap by \ncreating a Stormwater Management Manual.  The Georgia Stormwater \nManagement Manual has several volumes including a Policy Guidebook, \nTechnical Handbook and Coastal Supplement.  Jurisdictions in Georgia refer to \nthese volumes in their policies and ordinances so that standards and guidelines \nare clear for all affected parties. \nThe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality has developed a similar \nmanual called Erosion Control, Sediment Control and Stormwater Management \non Construction Sites and Urban Areas, however, it does not have as many \ntechnical details as the Georgia Manual, does not have a coastal supplement \nand is not used as effectively by jurisdictions in Mississippi as the Georgia \nManual is in Georgia.  MDEQ should consider adding a coastal supplement to \ntheir technical manual so it is more relevant to jurisdictions on the coast or \nadopting Georgia’s Coastal Stormwater Supplement to the Georgia Stormwater \nManagement Manual.  In addition, MDEQ should look to partner with the \nMississippi Alabama Sea Grant Consortium, Grand Bay National Estuarine \nResearch Reserve (NERR), or similar organizations and agencies to provide \ntraining to jurisdictions and engineers on how to use the manual. \n  Fertilizer Ordinance \nCurrently, higher levels of Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) are \nbeing recorded at the gage in Diamondhead indicating that more of the \nnutrients entering Rotten Bayou are coming from the more urban area of the \nwatershed and most likely from fertilizer use.  To address fertilizer use in urban \nareas many jurisdictions in Florida have adopted some form of a fertilizer \nordinance based off of the Florida Department of Environmental Quality’s \nModel Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use on Urban Landscapes.  See \nAppendix J:  Model Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use on Urban \nLandscapes.  The City of Diamondhead should consider adopting some form of \nfertilizer ordinance, in coordination with education and outreach to property \nowners about responsible fertilizer use, as a means of reducing nutrients \nentering Rotten Bayou. \n  Urban Wildlife Population Control \nWildlife populations within urban areas can reach unnatural levels that are not \nadequately supported by the environment and can negatively affect water \nquality.  Common examples are deer, Canada geese, raccoons, and squirrels.  \nWater quality at the pond off Gex Drive in Diamondhead is an example of a \nhuman altered environment that is inviting unnatural levels of geese that are \nnegatively impacting the quality of water flowing into Rotten Bayou.  To control \npopulations of urban wildlife, the types, number and health of the populations \nin comparison to habitat availability should be regularly monitored.  Methods of \ncontrol may include habitat modification or animal relocation. \n  \n \n52\n\nStructural \n  Pre and Post Construction \nAny type of construction or earthwork exposes soil and makes areas more \nsusceptible to erosion.  Best management practices for controlling impacts from \nconstruction are extremely important, especially given the uptick in \ndevelopment following the recession.  For most development, a Stormwater \nPollution Prevention Plan is required in which the developer must show what \nbest management practices they intend to implement to minimize impacts \ndownstream.   \nIn the City of Diamondhead, if the site is over five acres, the site is the \njurisdiction of MDEQ.  A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), Large \nConstruction Notice of Intent (LCNOI) and permit are required and must be filed \nwith MDEQ and the city.  Between 10,000 square feet and five acres is the city’s \nresponsibility.  The city requires that development in this size range have a \npermit, Small Construction Notice of Intent (SCNOI) and SWPPP.  Under 10,000 \nsquare feet does not require a plan or permit. \nIn Hancock and Harrison Counties, if the site is over five acres, the site is the \njurisdiction of the MDEQ.  A SWPPP, LCNOI and permit are required.  Between \none and five acres are the Counties’ responsibility.  The counties require that \ndevelopment in this size range have a permit, SCNOI and SWPPP.  Under one \nacre does not require a plan or permit. \nMDEQ has a technical guide to assist in the development of these plans titled \nErosion Control, Sediment Control and Stormwater Management on \nConstruction Sites and Urban Areas.  Volume one, Erosion and Sediment Control \nManual, covers BMPs through construction and volume two, Stormwater Runoff \nManagement Manual, covers post construction BMPs.  There does not appear \nto be a lack of regulation or guidance concerning pre and post construction \nBMPs, however, there are currently active construction sites that do not have \nadequate controls in place.  See Figure 15.  The issue appears to be more with \nlack of capacity to enforce the SWPPP’s.  As development continues to increase \nin Rotten Bayou Watershed, MDEQ and the jurisdictions need to view erosion \nand stormwater control as a priority and increase their capacity to monitor and \nenforce SWPPP’s.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n53\n\nFigure 15: Active Construction Site in Rotten Bayou Watershed \n \nSource: Kelsey Johnson. Photo taken April 2015 \n  Drainage swale maintenance \nThe drainage systems in Rotten Bayou Watershed are primarily open, grassy \nswales.  This is an excellent starting point in terms of stormwater management \nbecause there are theoretically more opportunities for infiltration than with \npiped, curb and gutter systems.  In order to function at an optimal level, \nhowever, swales need to be properly maintained.  Maintenance typically \ninvolves litter control and maintaining the grass or wetland plant cover.  \nSediment needs to be removed once it has exceeded 25 percent of the original \ndesign volume, but scouring ditches without revegetating only creates more \nproblems downstream.  Grass should be mowed to a height of 3-4 inches and \nalternate planting should be considered where appropriate or where grass has \nnot been successfully established.  In addition, during construction it is \nimportant to stabilize the embankment either with a temporary grass cover or \nwith natural or synthetic erosion control products.  General maintenance \nguidelines can be found online at \nhttp://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Grassed-Swales.cfm \n  Small Scale Urban BMPs \nRain barrels and rain gardens are examples of smaller scale urban BMPs that can \nhave a significant positive impact on water quality if implemented throughout a \ncommunity.  The Diamondhead Garden Club would be an excellent organization \nto educate and encourage the community in regards to these practices.  In \naddition, specific species of native vegetation were incorporated in the \nDiamondhead Duck Pond Demonstration Project to provide residents with \nexamples of plants that can be used in rain gardens or other wet areas of their \nyards. \n \n \n \n54\n\n \nAgricultural and Rural BMPs \n Nonstructural   \nLogging BMPs \nForested areas within Rotten Bayou Watershed are routinely used for \nharvesting lumber.  Some of these areas are fairly close to Rotten Bayou.  An \nexample is the area adjacent to Rotten Bayou Cemetery on the border of \nDiamondhead and Harrison County.  The Mississippi Forestry Commission (MFC) \nencourages BMPs in regards to forestry and logging and has a guide called Best \nManagement Practices for Forestry in Mississippi.  MFC could go a step further, \nhowever, and incentivize implementation of these practices.  In Missouri, the \nMissouri Department of Conservation implemented a cost-share program \ndesigned to be a partnership between the logger and property owner.\n79\n  The \nMDC pays loggers $10 to $20 per acre and landowners $5 for every acre in \nwhich they implement BMPs.  Funding was provided through a Natural \nResources Conservation Service Conservation Innovation Grant. \nOrdinances can also help improve logging practices through regulation and/or \nincentives.  An example of such an ordinance is from Carbon County, Utah, \nwhere County Commissioners passed a Timber Harvest Ordinance.  Property \nowners are required to submit an application and obtain a permit to harvest \ntimber when it will exceed a certain tonnage.  The ordinance also called for the \nselection and appointment of a professional County Forester. This person \nadministers the ordinance by reviewing permit applications, issuing permits to \nqualifying applicants, and inspecting logging jobs on private land. Other forest \npractices addressed include road maintenance, winter operations, site \npreparation, regeneration, revegetation, chemical management, and prescribed \nburns.\n80\n   Hancock and Harrison Counties should consider using a similar \nmechanism to increase the implementation of logging BMPs.   \n \nStructural \nThe following structural, agricultural BMPs were implemented as part of the Rotten \nBayou Watershed Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Project and are recommended \nfor continued implementation. \nWater and Sediment Control Basin \nWater and sediment control basins are designed to trap sediment, reduce \nerosion, reform the land surface and improve water quality.  The basins usually \nconsist of a short embankment or combination ridge and channel generally \nconstructed across the slope and minor watercourses. \nHeavy Use Area Protection \nHeavy use area protection methods reinforce locations that are frequented by \nlivestock by establishing vegetative cover, surfacing with suitable materials, or \n55\n\ninstalling needed structures.  Heavy use protection areas are often combined \nwith tanks or troughs that hold drinking water for livestock.  \nFencing \nFencing should be strategically placed to exclude livestock from areas that \nshould be protected from grazing or access, such as waterways. \nPond (Alternative Water Source) \nPonds can be installed by constructing a dam or an embankment or by \nexcavating a pit or dug out.  Ponds can serve to catch and store runoff and act as \na water source for livestock. \nCritical Area Planting \nAppropriate vegetation should be planted in areas that are critically eroded or \nlikely to experience erosion.  It is important for water quality for any \neroded/erodible areas to be planted, it is emphasized here for rural and \nagricultural zones because these areas can easily go overlooked on larger plots \nof land. \n                            \n3.2 Education and Outreach Activities \nEducation and outreach efforts were critical to developing the Rotten Bayou WIP and informing the \ncommunity about challenges and opportunities that affect the water quality in Rotten Bayou \nWatershed.  Outreach efforts began in the spring of 2014 and have continued through the duration of \nthe project period.  Activities included developing various materials and signage, hosting workshops, and \ncoordinating activities with local schools.  Section 3.2.1 gives a summary of education and outreach \nactivities that have been completed during the development of the WIP while Section 3.2.2 describes \nrecommended activities to be implemented in the future. \n \n3.2.1 Summary of Activities Conducted During the Planning Period \nGoals \n1. Increase awareness of watershed and Rotten \nBayou Watershed Plan \n2. Improve stakeholder knowledge of watershed \ndynamics \n3. Inspire residents and stakeholders to take action \n4.

Facebook is free and \nallows the partnership to update residents on current happenings and gather feedback on \npertinent issues.  During the project period, staff at the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio \ncreated and maintained the Facebook page.  As the project concludes, one to two people who \nplan to continue as members of the Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership should be nominated \nby the Steering Committee to be administrators of the Facebook page.   \nMS Coastal Cleanup \nRotten Bayou is a registered site of the Mississippi Coastal Cleanup.  In the past volunteers have \nmet at the Diamondhead Marina to clean up trash in the immediate area.  The Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Partnership became actively involved in the cleanup at this site in October 2014 and \nshould continue to participate to encourage the cleanup efforts to extend further up Rotten \nBayou.   \nProjects for Scout Troops \nMany Boy and Girl Scout troops are active in Rotten Bayou Watershed.  Often these young men \nand women are looking for volunteer projects to help complete requirements of their programs.  \nAppendix K includes sample projects for Boy Scouts related to the Soil and Water Conservation \nBadge.  As updates are made to the Rotten Bayou WIP more sample projects should be \ndeveloped and disseminated to active troops. \nSeptic System Maintenance \nIn the absence of funding to tie-in additional areas on septic system, an educational campaign \nabout the risks of nonfunctioning septic system and proper maintenance should target areas in \nthe watershed where high concentrations of septic systems remain.   \n58\n\n \nSignage \nStrategically placed signage with an educational component can be a very cost-effective way to \nincrease community members’\n awareness of water quality challenges and best management \npractices.  Currently, educational signage has been installed at the locations where BMPs were \ncompleted on Diamondhead’s Cardinal Golf Course and at the Duck Pond Demonstration Project \nlocated off Gex Drive in Diamondhead.  See Appendices E and F.  Similar signage should be \ninstalled where possible when publically accessible BMPs are installed.  In addition, if publically \naccessible access point or trails are created on or near Rotten Bayou, signage with an \neducational component should be included in the plans. \nPet Waste \nWhile the current level of pathogen testing does not distinguish between septic waste, domestic \nanimal waste and wildlife, anecdotally, there appears to be an excessive amount of pet waste \nthat is left on the ground.  Bacteria in pet waste does break down naturally, however the \necosystem cannot handle the number of domestic dogs typically concentrated in a small area.  \nThe natural ecosystem can only handle two canines in a square mile. In urban areas, there are \noften as many as 125 dogs per square mile.   Education around proper disposal of pet waste \nshould be distributed by the local jurisdictions, the DPOA, and local pet-related businesses such \nas veterinary clinics.  Signage and waste receptacles should also be provided in areas where \npeople frequently walk pets. \nEducation in Schools \nDuring the project period, Bayou Town Productions worked with the Rotten Bayou Watershed \nPartnership to schedule performances of their Watershed Harmony Puppet show at schools and \nlibraries that are either in the watershed or cater to residents who live in the watershed (See \nTable 6: Activities).  The Partnership should continue to work with Bayou Town Productions and \nother providers of educational programs to coordinate regular sessions in the schools, libraries \nand other community venues.  The Mississippi Department of Transportation, for example, does \nan anti-litter presentation geared towards kindergarten through third grade.\n81\n This program was \nnot engaged during the project period, but would be an excellent partner to consider for future \noutreach and education efforts. \nDuring the project period the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio secured funding from \nNOAA’s Gulf of Mexico Bay-Watershed Education and Training Program (Gulf B-WET) for the \n2014-2015 school year to work with fifth graders at East Hancock Elementary School (See \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed).  The grant funding not only \nallowed GCCDS staff to work with students during the 2014-2015 school year, but provided \nsupplies and training to teachers to continue the program in future years.  The Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Partnership should check in with East Hancock Elementary School at the beginning of \neach school year to encourage reuse of the program and materials and see if there is any way \nthe Partnership can be of assistance.  In addition, some of the children in the watershed go to \nDelisle Elementary School, part of the Pass Christian School District.  There may be an \nopportunity for this program to be shared with Delisle Elementary School so that more children \nin the watershed are reached. \n \n59\n\n \n \nPromote Use of Native Plants \nUse of native plants, especially in areas that tend to remain wet, are susceptible to erosion, or \nare near waterways, can have a positive and substantial effect on water quality.  Many residents \nwould likely be willing to use native plants in place of grass or invasive varieties if they knew \nwhat to plant and the benefits of doing so.  The Diamondhead Garden Club and Pine Hills \nNursery, the only nursery in Rotten Bayou Watershed, would be ideal promoters of the use of \nnative plants.  Both have been involved with the Rotten Bayou Watershed Project and the \nRotten Bayou Watershed Partnership should continue to work with these and other potential \npartners to promote the use of native plants and other BMPs (See Section 3.1.2). \nEstablish More Connections with County Residents \nEstablishing connections with residents in rural areas can be a challenge given the dispersed \nnature of development.  Often churches or civic organizations can be a good and efficient way to \nconnect with county residents.  During the funded project period, the Rotten Bayou Watershed \nPartnership was able to work with Sacred Heart Catholic Church, a church located at the top of \nthe watershed that draws its membership from the Fenton/Dedeaux communities.  The timing \nof the project, however, did not align well with changes in church leadership and all of the \nplanned work and educational activities could not be completed.  The Rotten Bayou Watershed \nPartnership should continue to work with Sacred Heart Catholic Church, other churches in the \narea, and organizations such as the Knights of Columbus to better engage county residents. \nWorkshops with Local Leadership \nWhile several of the workshops conducted during the Rotten Bayou Watershed project period \nfocused on educating local leadership on BMPs that would improve water quality in Rotten \nBayou, continuing education with this particular stakeholder group is needed (See Table 6: \nActivities).  In addition, while there was significant participation from leadership in \nDiamondhead at the workshops and some representation from both Hancock and Harrison \nCounties, more effort needs to be made to encourage leadership from the counties to attend \nfuture trainings.  Two specific areas where more training is needed are swale maintenance and \nadopting and enforcing ordinances. \n \n3.3 Plan Evaluation and Revision \n3.3.1 Monitoring Plan \nMDEQ \nMDEQ, in conjunction with USGS, conducted water quality monitoring prior to the \nimplementation of BMP activities.  Monitoring was suspended to allow for BMP installation.  \nOnce BMP installation is completed, MDEQ and USGS will re-instate monitoring activities in an \neffort to show water quality improvements.  The timeline and extent of future monitoring is still \nto be determined.  MDEQ is also considering monitoring Rotten Bayou for pathogens including \nFecal Coliform and E. Coli for an additional year. \n60\n\n \nResearch and Education to Advance Conservation and Habitat (REACH) \nREACH plans to collect storm runoff samples from the following locations just downstream of \nwhere BMPs have been installed in Rotten Bayou Watershed: \n Dry Swale on hole one of Diamondhead’s Cardinal Golf Course. \n Naturalized stream segment on hole two of Diamondhead’s Cardinal Golf Course. \n Control Site at hole one of Diamondhead’s Cardinal Golf Course. \n Stream naturalization adjacent to overflow at Diamondhead Duck Pond. \nDiamondhead Country Club and Property Owners Association is also looking to implement BMPs \non holes two and seven of the Pine Golf Course this summer.  If these are installed, REACH plans \nto monitor these as well.  All of the golf course samples are run through the MDEQ for TN, \nnitrate-nitrite, ammonia, ortho-phosphorus and suspended sediment. \nSample and discharge readings were taken at Diamondhead Duck Pond prior to the stream \nnaturalization.  One set of samples will be run for nutrients including nitrate-nitrite, ammonia, \northo-phosphorus, TP, TN, and total suspended solids.  The other set will be sent to the USDA \nand run for fecal coliforms and e. coli.  REACH plans to monitor these sites through October \n2015. \nRestore Corps \nClimb Community Development Corporation (Climb CDC) is a nonprofit Mississippi community \ndevelopment agency whose mission is to promote strong communities by providing individuals \naccess to opportunities that inspire self-reliance.  As part of its workforce training program, \nCLIMB CDC formed a Gulf Coast Restore Corps that is part of the national Corps Network.  The \nRestore Corps will participate in projects related to the restoration of the Gulf of Mexico from \nthe effects of the 2010 Oil Spill.  The team is able to provide services including monitoring water \nquality, conducting visual waterway assessments, and implementing or providing ongoing \nmaintenance for restoration/recreation projects.  Fees for services are relatively minimal and \nare determined at the time the services are requested.  If state agencies such as MDEQ and \nUSGS are not able to continue monitoring Rotten Bayou in the future, the Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Partnership should consider partnering with paid and semi-professional groups like \nthe Gulf Coast Restore Corps for periodic monitoring and assessment. \nSchools \nAs mentioned in sections 1.3 and 3.2, the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio secured funding \nfrom NOAA’s Gulf of Mexico Bay-Watershed Education and Training Program (Gulf B-WET) for \nthe 2014-2015 school year to work with fifth graders at East Hancock Elementary School.  See \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed.  The grant funding not only \nallowed GCCDS staff to work with students during the 2014-2015 school year, but provided \nsupplies and training to teachers to continue the program in future years.  The Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Partnership should contact East Hancock Elementary School at the beginning of each \nschool year to encourage continued monitoring of Rotten Bayou and information sharing \nbetween the school, Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership and larger community. \n \n61\n\n \nWatchful Stewards Program \nMuch of the information about changes in Rotten Bayou over time was gathered anecdotally \nfrom people who either live or recreate on the bayou.  Since there is currently no direct public \naccess to Rotten Bayou, it will be important for the Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership to \nmaintain relationships with people who have constant visual or physical contact with the bayou.  \nThe partnership may want to consider instating a more formal Watchful Stewards Program \nwhere residents can regularly report on changes to the bayou environment or concerns or \nopportunities that should be addressed by the partnership. \n \n3.3.2 Adaptive Management and Plan Revision \nThe goals, objectives and resulting strategies and recommendations included in the Rotten \nBayou Watershed Implementation Plan have been determined based on an assessment \nconducted between 2012 and 2015.  Environmental and socioeconomic conditions are ever \nchanging.  These conditions, as well as any implemented Best Management Practices, will likely \nhave an impact on the watershed and water quality in Rotten Bayou.  As such, the Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Partnership should plan to conduct an integrated assessment of Rotten Bayou \nWatershed on a routine basis and make adjustments or amendments to the Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Implementation Plan as justified by the results of the assessments.  According to the \nMississippi Coastal Nutrient Reduction Strategy, “five years is considered adequate for observing \nnear-field changes in water quality from the implementation of various management practices \nin the watershed.”\n82\n  The Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership should begin conducting its first \nassessment and plan revision in 2020.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n62\n\n1\n U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

They\nhighlight soil limitations that affect various land uses and provide information about\nthe properties of the soils in the survey areas. Soil surveys are designed for many\ndifferent users, including farmers, ranchers, foresters, agronomists, urban planners,\ncommunity officials, engineers, developers, builders, and home buyers. Also,\nconservationists, teachers, students, and specialists in recreation, waste disposal,\nand pollution control can \nuse the surveys to help them understand, protect, or enhance\nthe environment.\nVarious land use regulations of Federal, State, and local governments may impose\nspecial restrictions on land use or land treatment. Soil surveys identify soil properties\nthat are used in making various land use or land treatment decisions. The information\nis intended to help the land users identify and reduce the effects of soil limitations on\nvarious land uses. The landowner or user is responsible for identifying and complying\nwith existing laws and regulations.\nAlthough soil survey information can be used for general farm, local, and wider area\nplanning, onsite investigation is needed to supplement this information in some cases.\nExamples include soil quality assessments (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/\nnrcs/main/soils/health/) and certain conservation and engineering applications. For\nmore detailed information, contact your local USDA Service Center (http://\noffices.sc.egov.usda.gov/locator/app?agency=nrcs) or your NRCS State Soil\nScientist (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/contactus/?\ncid=nrcs142p2_053951).\nGreat differences in soil properties can occur within short distances. Some soils are\nseasonally wet or subject to flooding. Some are too unstable to be used as a\nfoundation for buildings or roads. Clayey or wet soils are poorly suited to use as septic\ntank absorption fields. A high water table makes a soil poorly suited to basements or\nunderground installations.\nThe National Cooperative Soil Survey is a joint effort of the United States Department\nof Agriculture and other Federal agencies, State agencies including the Agricultural\nExperiment Stations, and local agencies. The Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) has leadership for the Federal part of the National Cooperative Soil\nSurvey.\nInformation about soils is updated periodically. Updated information is available\nthrough the NRCS Web Soil Survey, the site for official soil survey information.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) prohibits discrimination in all its programs\nand activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, and where\napplicable, sex, marital status, familial status, parental status, religion, sexual\norientation, genetic information, political beliefs, reprisal, or because all or a part of an\nindividual's income is derived from any public assistance program.

Soil Resource Report\n5\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nHow Soil Surveys Are Made\nSoil surveys are made to provide information about the soils and miscellaneous areas\nin a specific area. \nThey include a description of the soils and miscellaneous areas and\ntheir location on the landscape and tables that show soil properties and limitations\naffecting various uses. Soil scientists observed the steepness, length, and shape of\nthe slopes; the general pattern of drainage; the kinds of crops and native plants; and\nthe kinds of bedrock. They observed and described many soil profiles. A soil profile is\nthe sequence of natural layers, or horizons, in a soil. The profile extends from the\nsurface down into the unconsolidated material in which the soil formed or from the\nsurface down to bedrock. The unconsolidated material is devoid of roots and other\nliving organisms and has not been changed by other biological activity.\nCurrently, soils are mapped according to the boundaries of major land resource areas\n(MLRAs). MLRAs are geographically associated land resource units that share\ncommon characteristics related to physiography, geology, climate, water resources,\nsoils, biological resources, and land uses (USDA, 2006). Soil survey areas typically\nconsist of parts of one or more MLRA.\nThe soils and miscellaneous areas in a survey area occur in an orderly pattern that is\nrelated to the geology, landforms, relief, climate, and natural vegetation of the area.\nEach kind of soil and miscellaneous area is associated with a particular kind of\nlandform or with a segment of the landform. By observing the soils and miscellaneous\nareas in the survey area and relating their position to specific segments of the\nlandform, a soil scientist develops a concept, or model, of how they were formed. Thus,\nduring mapping, this model enables the soil scientist to predict with a considerable\ndegree of accuracy the kind of soil or miscellaneous area at a specific location on the\nlandscape.\nCommonly, individual soils on the landscape merge into one another as their\ncharacteristics gradually change. To construct an accurate soil map, however, soil\nscientists must determine the boundaries between the soils. They can observe only\na limited number of soil profiles. Nevertheless, these observations, supplemented by\nan understanding of the soil-vegetation-landscape relationship, are sufficient to verify\npredictions of the kinds of soil in an area and to determine the boundaries.\nSoil scientists recorded the characteristics of the soil profiles that they studied. They\nnoted soil color, texture, size and shape of soil aggregates, kind and amount of rock\nfragments, distribution of plant roots, reaction, and other features that enable them to\nidentify soils. After describing the soils in the survey area and determining their\nproperties, the soil scientists assigned the soils to taxonomic classes (units).\nTaxonomic classes are concepts. Each taxonomic class has a set of soil\ncharacteristics with precisely defined limits. The classes are used as a basis for\ncomparison to classify soils systematically. Soil taxonomy, the system of taxonomic\nclassification used in the United States, is based mainly on the kind and character of\nsoil properties and the arrangement of horizons within the profile. After the soil\nscientists classified and named the soils in the survey area, they compared the\n6\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nindividual soils with similar soils in the same taxonomic class in other areas so that\nthey could confirm data and assemble additional data based on experience and\nresearch.\nThe objective of soil mapping is not to delineate pure map unit components; the\nobjective is to separate \nthe landscape into landforms or landform segments that have\nsimilar use and management requirements. Each map unit is defined by a unique\ncombination of soil components and/or miscellaneous areas in predictable\nproportions. Some components may be highly contrasting to the other components of\nthe map unit. The presence of minor components in a map unit in no way diminishes\nthe usefulness or accuracy of the data. The delineation of such landforms and\nlandform segments on the map provides sufficient information for the development of\nresource plans. If intensive use of small areas is planned, onsite investigation is\nneeded to define and locate the soils and miscellaneous areas.\nSoil scientists make many field observations in the process of producing a soil map.\nThe frequency of observation is dependent upon several factors, including scale of\nmapping, intensity of mapping, design of map units, complexity of the landscape, and\nexperience of the soil scientist. Observations are made to test and refine the soil-\nlandscape model and predictions and to verify the classification of the soils at specific\nlocations. Once the soil-landscape model is refined, a significantly smaller number of\nmeasurements of individual soil properties are made and recorded. These\nmeasurements may include field measurements, such as those for color, depth to\nbedrock, and texture, and laboratory measurements, such as those for content of\nsand, silt, clay, salt, and other components. Properties of each soil typically vary from\none point to another across the landscape.\nObservations for map unit components are aggregated to develop ranges of\ncharacteristics for the components. The aggregated values are presented. Direct\nmeasurements do not exist for every property presented for every map unit\ncomponent. Values for some properties are estimated from combinations of other\nproperties.\nWhile a soil survey is in progress, samples of some of the soils in the area generally\nare collected for laboratory analyses and for engineering tests. Soil scientists interpret\nthe data from these analyses and tests as well as the field-observed characteristics\nand the soil properties to determine the expected behavior of the soils under different\nuses. Interpretations for all of the soils are field tested through observation of the soils\nin different uses and under different levels of management. Some interpretations are\nmodified to fit local conditions, and some new interpretations are developed to meet\nlocal needs. Data are assembled from other sources, such as research information,\nproduction records, and field experience of specialists. For example, data on crop\nyields under defined levels of management are assembled from farm records and from\nfield or plot experiments on the same kinds of soil.\nPredictions about soil behavior are based not only on soil properties but also on such\nvariables as climate and biological activity. Soil conditions are predictable over long\nperiods of time, but they are not predictable from year to year. For example, soil\nscientists can predict with a fairly high degree of accuracy that a given soil will have\na high water table within certain depths in most years, but they cannot predict that a\nhigh water table will always be at a specific level in the soil on a specific date.\nAfter soil scientists located and identified the significant natural bodies of soil in the\nsurvey area, they drew the boundaries of these bodies on aerial photographs and\nidentified each as a specific map unit. Aerial photographs show trees, buildings, fields,\nroads, and rivers, all of which help in locating boundaries accurately.\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n7\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nSoil Map\nThe soil map section includes the soil map for the defined area of interest, a list of soil\nmap units on the map and extent of each map unit, and cartographic symbols\ndisplayed on the map.

The map unit descriptions, along with the\nmaps, can be used to determine the composition and properties of a unit.\nA map unit delineation on a soil map represents an area dominated by one or more\nmajor kinds of soil or miscellaneous areas. A map unit is identified and named\naccording to the taxonomic classification of the dominant soils. Within a taxonomic\nclass there are precisely defined limits for the properties of the soils. On the landscape,\nhowever, the soils are natural phenomena, and they have the characteristic variability\nof all natural phenomena. Thus, the range of some observed properties may extend\nbeyond the limits defined for a taxonomic class. Areas of soils of a single taxonomic\nclass rarely, if ever, can be mapped without including areas of other taxonomic\nclasses. Consequently, every map unit is made up of the soils or miscellaneous areas\nfor which it is named and some minor components that belong to taxonomic classes\nother than those of the major soils.\nMost minor soils have properties similar to those of the dominant soil or soils in the\nmap unit, and thus they do not affect use and management. These are called\nnoncontrasting, or similar, components. They may or may not be mentioned in a\nparticular map unit description. Other minor components, however, have properties\nand behavioral characteristics divergent enough to affect use or to require different\nmanagement. These are called contrasting, or dissimilar, components. They generally\nare in small areas and could not be mapped separately because of the scale used.\nSome small areas of strongly contrasting soils or miscellaneous areas are identified\nby a special symbol on the maps. If included in the database for a given area, the\ncontrasting minor components are identified in the map unit descriptions along with\nsome characteristics of each. A few areas of minor components may not have been\nobserved, and consequently they are not mentioned in the descriptions, especially\nwhere the pattern was so complex that it was impractical to make enough observations\nto identify all the soils and miscellaneous areas on the landscape.\nThe presence of minor components in a map unit in no way diminishes the usefulness\nor accuracy of the data. The objective of mapping is not to delineate pure taxonomic\nclasses but rather to separate the landscape into landforms or landform segments that\nhave similar use and management requirements. The delineation of such segments\non the map provides sufficient information for the development of resource plans. If\nintensive use of small areas is planned, however, onsite investigation is needed to\ndefine and locate the soils and miscellaneous areas.\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n13\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nAn identifying symbol precedes the map unit name in the map unit descriptions. Each\ndescription includes general facts about the unit and gives important soil properties\nand qualities.\nSoils that have profiles that are almost alike make up a soil series. Except for\ndifferences in texture of \nthe surface layer, all the soils of a series have major horizons\nthat are similar in composition, thickness, and arrangement.\nSoils of one series can differ in texture of the surface layer, slope, stoniness, salinity,\ndegree of erosion, and other characteristics that affect their use. On the basis of such\ndifferences, a soil series is divided into soil phases. Most of the areas shown on the\ndetailed soil maps are phases of soil series. The name of a soil phase commonly\nindicates a feature that affects use or management. For example, Alpha silt loam, 0\nto 2 percent slopes, is a phase of the Alpha series.\nSome map units are made up of two or more major soils or miscellaneous areas.\nThese map units are complexes, associations, or undifferentiated groups.\nA complex consists of two or more soils or miscellaneous areas in such an intricate\npattern or in such small areas that they cannot be shown separately on the maps. The\npattern and proportion of the soils or miscellaneous areas are somewhat similar in all\nareas. Alpha-Beta complex, 0 to 6 percent slopes, is an example.\nAn association is made up of two or more geographically associated soils or\nmiscellaneous areas that are shown as one unit on the maps. Because of present or\nanticipated uses of the map units in the survey area, it was not considered practical\nor necessary to map the soils or miscellaneous areas separately. The pattern and\nrelative proportion of the soils or miscellaneous areas are somewhat similar. Alpha-\nBeta association, 0 to 2 percent slopes, is an example.\nAn undifferentiated group is made up of two or more soils or miscellaneous areas that\ncould be mapped individually but are mapped as one unit because similar\ninterpretations can be made for use and management. The pattern and proportion of\nthe soils or miscellaneous areas in a mapped area are not uniform. An area can be\nmade up of only one of the major soils or miscellaneous areas, or it can be made up\nof all of them. Alpha and Beta soils, 0 to 2 percent slopes, is an example.\nSome surveys include miscellaneous areas. Such areas have little or no soil material\nand support little or no vegetation. Rock outcrop is an example.\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n14\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nHancock County, Mississippi\nAt—Atmore silt loam\nMap Unit Setting\nNational map unit symbol: c4w1\nElevation: 20 to 400 feet\nMean annual precipitation: 40 to 75 inches\nMean annual air temperature: 61 to 72 degrees F\nFrost-free period: 200 to 335 days\nFarmland classification: Not prime farmland\nMap Unit Composition\nAtmore and similar soils: 85 percent\nMinor components: 12 percent\nEstimates are based on observations, descriptions, and transects of the mapunit.\nDescription of Atmore\nSetting\nLandform: Depressions\nLandform position (three-dimensional): Dip\nDown-slope shape: Linear\nAcross-slope shape: Linear\nParent material: Loamy marine deposits\nTypical profile\nH1 -

Commonly, such soil formed in recent\nalluvium or on steep, rocky slopes.\nAeration, soil\nThe exchange of air in soil with air from the atmosphere. The air in a well aerated\nsoil is similar to that in the atmosphere; the air in a poorly aerated soil is\nconsiderably higher in carbon dioxide and lower in oxygen.\nAggregate, soil\nMany fine particles held in a single mass or cluster. Natural soil aggregates, such\nas granules, blocks, or prisms, are called peds. Clods are aggregates produced\nby tillage or logging.\nAlkali (sodic) soil\nA soil having so high a degree of alkalinity (pH 8.5 or higher) or so high a\npercentage of exchangeable sodium (15 percent or more of the total\nexchangeable bases), or both, that plant growth is restricted.\nAlluvial cone\nA semiconical type of alluvial fan having very steep slopes. It is higher, narrower,\nand steeper than a fan and is composed of coarser and thicker layers of material\ndeposited by a combination of alluvial episodes and (to a much lesser degree)\nlandslides (debris flow). The coarsest materials tend to be concentrated at the\napex of the cone.\n88\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nAlluvial fan\nA low, outspread mass of loose materials and/or rock material, commonly with\ngentle slopes. It is \nshaped like an open fan or a segment of a cone. The material\nwas deposited by a stream at the place where it issues from a narrow mountain\nvalley or upland valley or where a tributary stream is near or at its junction with\nthe main stream. The fan is steepest near its apex, which points upstream, and\nslopes gently and convexly outward (downstream) with a gradual decrease in\ngradient.\nAlluvium\nUnconsolidated material, such as gravel, sand, silt, clay, and various mixtures of\nthese, deposited on land by running water.\nAlpha,alpha-dipyridyl\nA compound that when dissolved in ammonium acetate is used to detect the\npresence of reduced iron (Fe II) in the soil. A positive reaction implies reducing\nconditions and the likely presence of redoximorphic features.\nAnimal unit month (AUM)\nThe amount of forage required by one mature cow of approximately 1,000 pounds\nweight, with or without a calf, for 1 month.\nAquic conditions\nCurrent soil wetness characterized by saturation, reduction, and redoximorphic\nfeatures.\nArgillic horizon\nA subsoil horizon characterized by an accumulation of illuvial clay.\nArroyo\nThe flat-floored channel of an ephemeral stream, commonly with very steep to\nvertical banks cut in unconsolidated material. It is usually dry but can be\ntransformed into a temporary watercourse or short-lived torrent after heavy rain\nwithin the watershed.\nAspect\nThe direction toward which a slope faces. Also called slope aspect.\nAssociation, soil\nA group of soils or miscellaneous areas geographically associated in a\ncharacteristic repeating pattern and defined and delineated as a single map unit.\nAvailable water capacity (available moisture capacity)\nThe capacity of soils to hold water available for use by most plants. It is commonly\ndefined as the difference between the amount of soil water at field moisture\ncapacity and the amount at wilting point. It is commonly expressed as inches of\nwater per inch of soil. The capacity, in inches, in a 60-inch profile or to a limiting\nlayer is expressed as:\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n89\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nVery low: 0 to 3\nLow: 3 to 6\nModerate: 6 to 9\nHigh: 9 to 12\nVery high: More than 12\nBackslope\nThe position that forms the steepest and generally linear, middle portion of a\nhillslope. In profile, backslopes are commonly bounded by a convex shoulder\nabove and a concave footslope below.\nBackswamp\nA flood-plain landform. Extensive, marshy or swampy, depressed areas of flood\nplains between natural levees and valley sides or terraces.\nBadland\nA landscape that is \nintricately dissected and characterized by a very fine drainage\nnetwork with high drainage densities and short, steep slopes and narrow\ninterfluves. Badlands develop on surfaces that have little or no vegetative cover\noverlying unconsolidated or poorly cemented materials (clays, silts, or\nsandstones) with, in some cases, soluble minerals, such as gypsum or halite.\nBajada\nA broad, gently inclined alluvial piedmont slope extending from the base of a\nmountain range out into a basin and formed by the lateral coalescence of a series\nof alluvial fans. Typically, it has a broadly undulating transverse profile, parallel to\nthe mountain front, resulting from the convexities of component fans. The term is\ngenerally restricted to constructional slopes of intermontane basins.\nBasal area\nThe area of a cross section of a tree, generally referring to the section at breast\nheight and measured outside the bark. It is a measure of stand density, commonly\nexpressed in square feet.\nBase saturation\nThe degree to which material having cation-exchange properties is saturated with\nexchangeable bases (sum of Ca, Mg, Na, and K), expressed as a percentage of\nthe total cation-exchange capacity.\nBase slope (geomorphology)\nA geomorphic component of hills consisting of the concave to linear\n(perpendicular to the contour) slope that, regardless of the lateral shape, forms\nan apron or wedge at the bottom of a hillside dominated by colluvium and slope-\nwash sediments (for example, slope alluvium).\nBedding plane\nA planar or nearly planar bedding surface that visibly separates each successive\nlayer of stratified sediment or rock (of the same or different lithology) from the\npreceding or following layer; a plane of deposition. It commonly marks a change\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n90\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nin the circumstances of deposition and may show a parting, a color difference, a\nchange in particle size, or various combinations of these. The term is commonly\napplied to any bedding \nsurface, even one that is conspicuously bent or deformed\nby folding.\nBedding system\nA drainage system made by plowing, grading, or otherwise shaping the surface\nof a flat field. It consists of a series of low ridges separated by shallow, parallel\ndead furrows.\nBedrock\nThe solid rock that underlies the soil and other unconsolidated material or that is\nexposed at the surface.\nBedrock-controlled topography\nA landscape where the configuration and relief of the landforms are determined\nor strongly influenced by the underlying bedrock.\nBench terrace\nA raised, level or nearly level strip of earth constructed on or nearly on a contour,\nsupported by a barrier of rocks or similar material, and designed to make the soil\nsuitable for tillage and to prevent accelerated erosion.\nBisequum\nTwo sequences of soil horizons, each of which consists of an illuvial horizon and\nthe overlying eluvial horizons.\nBlowout (map symbol)\nA saucer-, cup-, or trough-shaped depression formed by wind erosion on a\npreexisting dune or other sand deposit, especially in an area of shifting sand or\nloose soil or where protective vegetation is disturbed or destroyed. The adjoining\naccumulation of sand derived from the depression, where recognizable, is\ncommonly included. Blowouts are commonly small.\nBorrow pit (map symbol)\nAn open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed,\nusually for construction purposes.\nBottom land\nAn informal term loosely applied to various portions of a flood plain.\nBoulders\nRock fragments larger than 2 feet (60 centimeters) in diameter.\nBreaks\nA landscape or tract of steep, rough or broken land dissected by ravines and\ngullies and marking a sudden change in topography.\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n91\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nBreast height\nAn average height of \n4.5 feet above the ground surface; the point on a tree where\ndiameter measurements are ordinarily taken.\nBrush management\nUse of mechanical, chemical, or biological methods to make conditions favorable\nfor reseeding or to reduce or eliminate competition from woody vegetation and\nthus allow understory grasses and forbs to recover. Brush management increases\nforage production and thus reduces the hazard of erosion. It can improve the\nhabitat for some species of wildlife.\nButte\nAn isolated, generally flat-topped hill or mountain with relatively steep slopes and\ntalus or precipitous cliffs and characterized by summit width that is less than the\nheight of bounding escarpments; commonly topped by a caprock of resistant\nmaterial and representing an erosion remnant carved from flat-lying rocks.\nCable yarding\nA method of moving felled trees to a nearby central area for transport to a\nprocessing facility. Most cable yarding systems involve use of a drum, a pole, and\nwire cables in an arrangement similar to that of a rod and reel used for fishing. To\nreduce friction and soil disturbance, felled trees generally are reeled in while one\nend is lifted or the entire log is suspended.\nCalcareous soil\nA soil containing enough calcium carbonate (commonly combined with\nmagnesium carbonate) to effervesce visibly when treated with cold, dilute\nhydrochloric acid.\nCaliche\nA general term for a prominent zone of secondary carbonate accumulation in\nsurficial materials in warm, subhumid to arid areas. Caliche is formed by both\ngeologic and pedologic processes. Finely crystalline calcium carbonate forms a\nnearly continuous surface-coating and void-filling medium in geologic (parent)\nmaterials. Cementation ranges from weak in nonindurated forms to very strong in\nindurated forms. Other minerals (e.g., carbonates, silicate, and sulfate) may occur\nas accessory cements. Most petrocalcic horizons and some calcic horizons are\ncaliche.\nCalifornia bearing ratio (CBR)\nThe load-supporting capacity of a soil as compared to that of standard crushed\nlimestone, expressed as a ratio. First standardized in California. A soil having a\nCBR of 16 supports 16 percent of the load that would be supported by standard\ncrushed limestone, per unit area, with the same degree of distortion.\nCanopy\nThe leafy crown of trees or shrubs.

The common soil cations are\ncalcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, and hydrogen.\nCation-exchange capacity\nThe total amount of \nexchangeable cations that can be held by the soil, expressed\nin terms of milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil at neutrality (pH 7.0) or at some\nother stated pH value. The term, as applied to soils, is synonymous with base-\nexchange capacity but is more precise in meaning.\nCatsteps\nSee Terracettes.\nCement rock\nShaly limestone used in the manufacture of cement.\nChannery soil material\nSoil material that has, by volume, 15 to 35 percent thin, flat fragments of\nsandstone, shale, slate, limestone, or schist as much as 6 inches (15 centimeters)\nalong the longest axis. A single piece is called a channer.\nChemical treatment\nControl of unwanted vegetation through the use of chemicals.\nChiseling\nTillage with an implement having one or more soil-penetrating points that shatter\nor loosen hard, compacted layers to a depth below normal plow depth.\nCirque\nA steep-walled, semicircular or crescent-shaped, half-bowl-like recess or hollow,\ncommonly situated at the head of a glaciated mountain valley or high on the side\nof a mountain. It was produced by the erosive activity of a mountain glacier. It\ncommonly contains a small round lake (tarn).\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n93\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nClay\nAs a soil separate, \nthe mineral soil particles less than 0.002 millimeter in diameter.\nAs a soil textural class, soil material that is 40 percent or more clay, less than 45\npercent sand, and less than 40 percent silt.\nClay depletions\nSee Redoximorphic features.\nClay film\nA thin coating of oriented clay on the surface of a soil aggregate or lining pores or\nroot channels. Synonyms: clay coating, clay skin.\nClay spot (map symbol)\nA spot where the surface texture is silty clay or clay in areas where the surface\nlayer of the soils in the surrounding map unit is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or\ncoarser.\nClaypan\nA dense, compact subsoil layer that contains much more clay than the overlying\nmaterials, from which it is separated by a sharply defined boundary. The layer\nrestricts the downward movement of water through the soil. A claypan is\ncommonly hard when dry and plastic and sticky when wet.\nClimax plant community\nThe stabilized plant community on a particular site. The plant cover reproduces\nitself and does not change so long as the environment remains the same.\nCoarse textured soil\nSand or loamy sand.\nCobble (or cobblestone)\nA rounded or partly rounded fragment of rock 3 to 10 inches (7.6 to 25 centimeters)\nin diameter.\nCobbly soil material\nMaterial that has 15 to 35 percent, by volume, rounded or partially rounded rock\nfragments 3 to 10 inches (7.6 to 25 centimeters) in diameter. Very cobbly soil\nmaterial has 35 to 60 percent of these rock fragments, and extremely cobbly soil\nmaterial has more than 60 percent.\nCOLE (coefficient of linear extensibility)\nSee Linear extensibility.\nColluvium\nUnconsolidated, unsorted earth material being transported or deposited on side\nslopes and/or at the base of slopes by mass movement (e.g., direct gravitational\naction) and by local, unconcentrated runoff.\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n94\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nComplex slope\nIrregular or variable slope. \nPlanning or establishing terraces, diversions, and other\nwater-control structures on a complex slope is difficult.\nComplex, soil\nA map unit of two or more kinds of soil or miscellaneous areas in such an intricate\npattern or so small in area that it is not practical to map them separately at the\nselected scale of mapping. The pattern and proportion of the soils or\nmiscellaneous areas are somewhat similar in all areas.\nConcretions\nSee Redoximorphic features.\nConglomerate\nA coarse grained, clastic sedimentary rock composed of rounded or subangular\nrock fragments more than 2 millimeters in diameter. It commonly has a matrix of\nsand and finer textured material. Conglomerate is the consolidated equivalent of\ngravel.\nConservation cropping system\nGrowing crops in combination with needed cultural and management practices.\nIn a good conservation cropping system, the soil-improving crops and practices\nmore than offset the effects of the soil-depleting crops and practices. Cropping\nsystems are needed on all tilled soils. Soil-improving practices in a conservation\ncropping system include the use of rotations that contain grasses and legumes\nand the return of crop residue to the soil. Other practices include the use of green\nmanure crops of grasses and legumes, proper tillage, adequate fertilization, and\nweed and pest control.\nConservation tillage\nA tillage system that does not invert the soil and that leaves a protective amount\nof crop residue on the surface throughout the year.\nConsistence, soil\nRefers to the degree of cohesion and adhesion of soil material and its resistance\nto deformation when ruptured. Consistence includes resistance of soil material to\nrupture and to penetration; plasticity, toughness, and stickiness of puddled soil\nmaterial; and the manner in which the soil material behaves when subject to\ncompression.

The sand, loamy sand, and sandy loam classes\nmay be further divided by specifying “coarse,” “fine,” or “very fine.”\nThin layer\nOtherwise suitable soil material that is too thin for the specified use.\nTill\nDominantly unsorted and nonstratified drift, generally unconsolidated and\ndeposited directly by a glacier without subsequent reworking by meltwater, and\nconsisting of a heterogeneous mixture of clay, silt, sand, gravel, stones, and\nboulders; rock fragments of various lithologies are embedded within a finer matrix\nthat can range from clay to sandy loam.\nTill plain\nAn extensive area of level to gently undulating soils underlain predominantly by\ntill and bounded at the distal end by subordinate recessional or end moraines.\nTilth, soil\nThe physical condition of the soil as related to tillage, seedbed preparation,\nseedling emergence, and root penetration.\nToeslope\nThe gently inclined surface at the base of a hillslope. Toeslopes in profile are\ncommonly gentle and linear and are constructional surfaces forming the lower part\nof a hillslope continuum that grades to valley or closed-depression floors.\nTopsoil\nThe upper part of the soil, which is the most favorable material for plant growth.\nIt is ordinarily rich in organic matter and is used to topdress roadbanks, lawns,\nand land affected by mining.\nTrace elements\nChemical elements, for example, zinc, cobalt, manganese, copper, and iron, in\nsoils in extremely small amounts. They are essential to plant growth.\nTread\nThe flat to gently sloping, topmost, laterally extensive slope of terraces, flood-plain\nsteps, or other stepped landforms; commonly a recurring part of a series of natural\nsteplike landforms, such as successive stream terraces.\nTuff\nA generic term for any consolidated or cemented deposit that is 50 percent or\nmore volcanic ash.\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n126\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nUpland\nAn informal, general term \nfor the higher ground of a region, in contrast with a low-\nlying adjacent area, such as a valley or plain, or for land at a higher elevation than\nthe flood plain or low stream terrace; land above the footslope zone of the hillslope\ncontinuum.\nValley fill\nThe unconsolidated sediment deposited by any agent (water, wind, ice, or mass\nwasting) so as to fill or partly fill a valley.\nVariegation\nRefers to patterns of contrasting colors assumed to be inherited from the parent\nmaterial rather than to be the result of poor drainage.\nVarve\nA sedimentary layer or a lamina or sequence of laminae deposited in a body of\nstill water within a year. Specifically, a thin pair of graded glaciolacustrine layers\nseasonally deposited, usually by meltwater streams, in a glacial lake or other body\nof still water in front of a glacier.\nVery stony spot (map symbol)\nA spot where 0.1 to 3.0 percent of the soil surface is covered by rock fragments\nthat are more than 10 inches in diameter in areas where the surface of the\nsurrounding soil is covered by less than 0.01 percent stones.\nWater bars\nSmooth, shallow ditches or depressional areas that are excavated at an angle\nacross a sloping road. They are used to reduce the downward velocity of water\nand divert it off and away from the road surface. Water bars can easily be driven\nover if constructed properly.\nWeathering\nAll physical disintegration, chemical decomposition, and biologically induced\nchanges in rocks or other deposits at or near the earth’s surface by atmospheric\nor biologic agents or by circulating surface waters but involving essentially no\ntransport of the altered material.\nWell graded\nRefers to soil material consisting of coarse grained particles that are well\ndistributed over a wide range in size or diameter. Such soil normally can be easily\nincreased in density and bearing properties by compaction. Contrasts with poorly\ngraded soil.\nWet spot (map symbol)\nA somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage\nclasses wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit.\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n127\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nWilting point (or permanent wilting point)\nThe moisture content of \nsoil, on an ovendry basis, at which a plant (specifically a\nsunflower) wilts so much that it does not recover when placed in a humid, dark\nchamber.\nWindthrow\nThe uprooting and tipping over of trees by the wind.\nCustom Soil Resource Report\n128\nAppendix A: Soil Survey\n\nMississippi National Heritage Inventory \nwww.mdwfp.com \nAccessed 8/15/14 \nThis list is not meant as a comprehensive listing of all plant and animal species.

Rotten Bayou’s \nbeneficial use is designated as “Aquatic Life Support.”  Applicable water quality standards \nincluded DO concentrations maintained at a daily average of not less than 5.0 milligrams per \nliter (mg/l) with an instantaneous minimum of not less than 4.0 mg/l.  For tributaries to \nSt. Louis Bay, the MDEQ 2007 water quality standard for nutrients states: \n \nWaters shall be free from materials attributable to municipal, industrial, agricultural \nor other discharges producing color, odor, taste, total suspended or dissolved solids, \nsediment, turbidity, or other conditions in such degree as to create a nuisance, render \nthe waters injurious to public health, recreation or to aquatic life and wildlife or \nadversely affect the palatability of fish, aesthetic quality, or impair the water for any \ndesignated use. (p. 5) \n \nThe purpose of this water quality assessment was to investigate watershed nutrient inputs to \nRotten Bayou and look for signatures of significant nonpoint source loads by understanding \ncurrent nutrient levels using existing watershed data and reviewing land use information.  \nResults of the evaluation were used in recommending management steps for controlling \nnutrients from the watershed to Rotten Bayou.  The nutrients considered were total nitrogen \n(TN) and total phosphorus (TP).   \n \nThe first step in this water quality assessment was to determine if current monitoring data \nbeing collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) within the Rotten Bayou watershed \nexceed applicable thresholds: total maximum daily load (TMDL) thresholds, draft thresholds \nfor non-tidal rivers and streams in southeast Mississippi, or threshold recommendations in \nthe tidally influenced St. Louis Bay.  The next step involved evaluating if adequate data exist \nto determine sub-watershed inputs and loads and to discern patterns based on land use and \nwater quality data so that management steps for controlling nutrients from the Rotten Bayou \nwatershed could be recommended. \n \nAppendix C: Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment\n\n \n \n \nRotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment  December 2014 \n 2 141124-01.01 \n1.1 Applicable Nutrient Thresholds \nA TMDL was developed for Rotten Bayou (along with four other tributaries to St. Louis Bay) \nin 2007 based on monitoring data and modeling of the system (MDEQ 2007).  Model \ncalibration and verification were based on water quality studies conducted in 1998, 1999, and \n2001.  The TMDL for organic enrichment was quantified in terms of total biochemical \noxygen demand, ultimate (TBODu)  ; since TBODu did not exceed the assimilative capacity of \nRotten Bayou, no reductions in permitted loads of organic material were specified in the \nTMDL in order to meet water quality limits.  The TMDL set a threshold concentration of \n1.5 mg/l as the target for TN and 0.1 mg/l for TP for waterbodies located in the St. Louis Bay \nwatershed.  Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) presented these \nconcentrations as preliminary target values for TMDL development but noted that the values \nare subject to revision after the development of numeric nutrient criteria.  Based on these \ntarget concentrations and estimated flows, the TMDL established nonpoint source load \nallocations for Rotten Bayou (inclusive of the nearby Jourdan River) of 5,810 pounds per day \n(lbs/day) for TN and 387 lbs/day for TP. \n \nThe State of Mississippi has not yet adopted numeric water quality standards for allowable \nnutrient concentrations; however, draft stream nutrient thresholds have been developed for \nnon-tidal streams and rivers to protect aquatic life uses in Mississippi (MDEQ 2011).  The \ndraft standards were based on reference approaches, stressor response approaches, and \nrelevant literature values.  For TN in southeast Mississippi rivers and streams, the \nrecommended thresholds range from 0.31 to 0.68 mg/l, depending on the approach; for TP, \nthe proposed criteria range from 0.01 to 0.05 mg/l, depending on the approach \n(MDEQ 2011).  Literature values and criteria from other states range from 0.18 to 2.0 mg/l \nfor TN and 0.02 to 0.2 mg/l for TP. \n \nIn 2013, the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA), under the direction of MDEQ, completed a \nstudy of sources, fate, transport, and effects of nutrients as a basis for protection in estuarine \nand near-coastal waters for St. Louis Bay (GOMA 2013).  The intent of this study was to \nprovide the technical foundation for pilot nutrient thresholds for St. Louis Bay, a tidally \ninfluenced coastal bay.  Based on empirical and mechanistic modeling results, the \npreliminary annual geometric mean threshold recommendations are 0.6 to 0.8 mg/l for TN \nand 0.06 to 0.08 mg/l for TP.  \nAppendix C: Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment\n\n \n \n \nRotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment  December 2014 \n 3 141124-01.01 \nTable 1 summarizes the TN and TP targets and thresholds from the three reports.  \n \nTable 1 \nVarious Targets and Thresholds for Tributaries to St. Louis Bay and for St. Louis Bay \nParameter \nTMDL Targets and Thresholds for \nTributaries to St. Louis Bay \n(MDEQ 2007) \nDraft Revised Stream \nNutrient Thresholds for \nSoutheast Mississippi \nRivers and Streams \n(MDEQ 2011) \nThreshold \nRecommendations for \nSt. Louis Bay Based on \nModeling Results \n(GOMA 2013) \nTarget* \n(lbs/day) \nThreshold \n(mg/l) \nThreshold \n(mg/l) \nThreshold \n(mg/l) \nTotal \nNitrogen \n5,810 1.5 0.31 –   0.68 0.6 –   0.8 \nTotal \nPhosphorus \n387 0.1 0.01 –   0.05 0.06 –   0.08 \nNotes: \n*Includes Jourdan River loads \nlb s/day = pounds per day \nmg/l = milligrams per liter \nTMDL = total maximum daily load \n \n2 DATA   S O U R C ES \n2.1 Water Quality \nLocations of monitoring gages within the Rotten Bayou watershed from the USGS National \nWater Information System website were reviewed.  Three freshwater (i.e., non-tidal) gages \nand one tidally-influenced gage were identified due to their proximity to Rotten Bayou \n(Figure 1): \n• 02481661 – Tributary to Bayou LaSalle near Vidalia, Mississippi \n• 02481663 – Rotten Bayou near Fenton, Mississippi \n• 0248166310 – Mill Creek at Fenton, Mississippi  \n• 0248166590 – Rotten Bayou Tributary No. 1 at Diamondhead, Mississippi \n \nThe gage at Diamondhead, located downstream of the bayou, is tidally-influenced.  Because \nof this, it is impossible to discern the influence of the Rotten Bayou watershed from the \ninfluence of St. Louis Bay to nutrient concentrations and loads at this gage due to reversal of \nAppendix C: Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment\n\n \n \n \nRotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment  December 2014 \n 4 141124-01.01 \nflow.  Therefore, while the data from this gage were reviewed and compared to appropriate \nthresholds, they were not considered in evaluations of sub-watershed contributions of \nnutrients.  In addition, point sources contribute nutrients into the tidally-influenced area \n(Liu et al. 2008) and, therefore, separating nonpoint source contributions at this gage would \nbe further complicated.   \n \nFlow and TN and TP concentration data from the three fr eshwater gages and one tidally \ninfluenced gage were downloaded from the website (USGS);  data were collected monthly or \nevery other month from 2012 to 2014, with some days having multiple measurements \n(Table 2).  It should be noted that the USGS data are considered draft and provisional and \nthat the USGS is anticipated to complete their monitoring of these gages in 2014.  Analyses of \nthe data by USGS are projected to occur by 2016.   \n \nTable 2 \nCounts of Available USGS Data \nGage \nYear \nTotal \nNitrogen \nConcentration \nTotal \nPhosphorus \nConcentration \nFlow \nMeasurements \nPaired \nConcentration \nand Flow \nMeasurements \n02481661 –   Tributary to \nBayou LaSalle near \nVidalia \n2012 43 43 7 7 \n2013 6 6 6 6 \n2014* 29 29 5 5 \n02481663 –   Rotten \nBayou near Fenton \n2012 9 9 9 9 \n2013 6 6 6 6 \n2014* 5 5 5 5 \n0248166310 –   Mill \nCreek at Fenton \n2012 51 51 9 9 \n2013 6 6 6 6 \n2014* 17 17 5 5 \n0248166590 –   Rotten \nBayou Tributary No. 1 at \nDiamondhead \n2012 37 37 9 8 \n2013 22 22 6 6 \n2014* 37 37 5 5 \nNote: \n*Per the project’s  schedule, data assessments were performed prior to the availability of all 2014 data.  Data from \nthe freshwater gages were downloaded on September 14, 2014, and from the tidal gage at Diamondhead on \nOctober 2, 2014. \nAppendix C: Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment\n\n \n \n \nRotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment  December 2014 \n 5 141124-01.01 \nData collected within Rotten Bayou during a special water quality study in August 2012 \n(USEPA 2014) were also reviewed.  The monitoring stations located within the bayou were \ntidally-influenced and therefore not used herein for comparison to nutrient thresholds. \n \n2.2 Land Use \nLand use information was downloaded from the internet (Multi-Resolution Land \nCharacteristics Consortium).  The coverage was based on the 2006 National Land Cover \nDatabase (NLCD), which employs a 16-class land cover classification scheme at a spatial \nresolution of 30 meters (Fry et al. 2011).  As of this assessment, the NLCD 2011 coverage was \nnot available online, only a coverage depicting changes in land use since 2006 was available. \n \n3 ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY \nThe water quality assessment methodology consisted of two steps: 1) comparison of TN and \nTP concentrations to TMDL thresholds (MDEQ 2007), draft stream nutrient thresholds \n(MDEQ 2011), and St. Louis Bay threshold recommendations (GOMA 2013); and 2) \nassessment of major land use types upstream of each gage.  Thresholds are summarized in \nTable 1.   \n \nNutrient loads, which are calculated by multiplying stream flow by nutrient concentrations, \nwere not computed due to the paucity of paired concentration and flow data (Table 2).  The \nevaluation of export coefficients (e.g., loads per unit area of watershed) likewise could not be \nperformed due to the limited dataset.  As a result, only concentrations and land use \nvariations in sub-watersheds were considered in qualitatively assessing potential sources and \nmanagement options for reducing nonpoint source nutrients reaching Rotten Bayou. \n \n4 FINDINGS \n4.1 Comparison of Concentrations to Appropriate Thresholds \nFigures 2 and 3 show temporals of TN and TP concentrations, respectively, at the three \nfreshwater gages.  Figures 4 and 5 show TN and TP concentration temporals for the tidally \ninfluenced gage at Diamondhead.  Measurements were taken on a routine basis as well as a \nsub-daily basis during storm events (Hicks 2014).   \nAppendix C: Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment\n\n \n \n \nRotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment  December 2014 \n 6 141124-01.01 \n4.1.1 Nutrient TMDL Thresholds \nFew TN and TP measurements from 2012 to 2014 exceeded the nutrient TMDL thresholds at \nthe freshwater gages (Figures 2 and 3).  For TN, none of the measurements exceeded the \nnutrient TMDL threshold with the exception of one measurement on July 18, 2012, at \n4:15 pm at 0248166310 Mill Creek at Fenton.  For TP, 8% and 4% of samples at 02481661 \nTributary to Bayou LaSalle near Vidalia and at 0248166310 Mill Creek at Fenton, \nrespectively, exceeded the TMDL threshold; these exceedances appear to have been during \nstorm events.  Only one sample taken at 02481663 Rotten Bayou near Fenton exceeded the \nTP TMDL threshold; this sample was collected on July 12, 2012. \n \n4.1.2 Draft Revised Stream Nutrient Thresholds \nFor the freshwater gages, some TN and TP concentrations from 2012 to 2014 were higher \nthan the draft revised stream nutrient thresholds for southeast Mississippi (Figures 2 and 3).  \nFor TN, 13% and 7% of samples exceeded the threshold at 02481661 Tributary to Bayou \nLaSalle near Vidalia and at 0248166310 Mill Creek at Fenton, respectively; these appear to \nhave been taken during storm events as multiple samples were taken on a single day \n(Hicks 2014).  In addition, detection limits reported for several samples were higher than the \nthreshold (Figure 2).  No TN measurement at 02481663 Rotten Bayou near Fenton exceeded \nthe threshold.  A similar pattern of exceedances is observed for TP data (Figure 3). \n \n4.1.3 St. Louis Bay Thresholds \nThe St. Louis Bay thresholds were developed based on tidally influenced monitoring data in \nSt. Louis Bay.  Table 3 summarizes annual geometric means of TN and TP for the tidal gage \nnear Rotten Bayou from 2012 to 2014.  At this gage, the annual geometric means exceeded \nthe St. Louis Bay thresholds for both TN and TP in 2013 and 2014.   \n \nAppendix C: Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment\n\n \n \n \nRotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment  December 2014 \n 7 141124-01.01 \nTable 3 \nAnnual Geometric Means at the Tidal Gage at Diamondhead \nNutrient \nAnnual Geometric Mean \n(mg/l) \n2012 2013 2014 \nTotal Nitrogen 0.68 1.15 1.02 \nTotal Phosphorus \n0.060 0.106 0.090 \nNotes: \n- Recommended thresholds for St. Louis Bay based on modeling (GOMA 2013): Total Nitrogen 0.6 to 0.8 mg/l, Total \nPhosphorus 0.06 to 0.08 mg/l \n-  The tidal gage is 0248166590 –   Rotten Bayou Tributary No. 1 at Diamondhead. \n-  Non-detect values were set to the detection limit prior to calculation. \nmg/l = milligrams per liter \n \n4.2 Incorporation of Land Use Information \nFigure 6 shows land cover classification within sub-watersheds upstream of each of the three \nfreshwater USGS gages.  The sub-watersheds were delineated in ArcMap using topography \nand the gage locations.   \n \nFigure 7 shows the proportions of each land cover classification within each sub-watershed.  \nLand cover is similar among the three sub-watersheds, with shrub/scrub, evergreen forest, \nand woody wetlands being dominant.  From the station furthest upland to downstream, the \nproportions of developed open space and woody wetlands increase while shrub/scrub and \ngrassland/herbaceous proportions decrease. \n \n5 LIMITATIONS OF DATA ASSESSMENT \nLimitations of this data assessment are as follows: \n• Few paired measurements of TN and TP concentration and flow exist for three \nfreshwater gages near Rotten Bayou (Table 2) and therefore, nutrient loads (i.e., \nconcentration multiplied by flow) cannot be adequately assessed.  The calculation \nof nutrient loads would provide an indication of the amount of nutrients passing \neach gage during the time of measurement. \n• Measurements of TN, TP, and flow during storm events are limited. \nAppendix C: Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment\n\n \n \n \nRotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment  December 2014 \n 8 141124-01.01 \n• Three years of data are not a long enough record to assess long-term or seasonal \ntrends or fluctuations in TN and TP concentrations due to precipitation (e.g., dry \nyear versus wet year). \n• Data downloaded from USGS are draft and provisional.  Per the project’s schedule, \ndata from 2014 were downloaded in September and October 2014; therefore, an \nassessment of all 2014 data was not performed.  Data are being collected by USGS \nthrough 2014. \n• The reported detection limits for TN data from USGS are sometimes above the \nthreshold recommendations or are high compared to detected data (see open \nsymbols on Figures 2 and 4).  These detection limits should be investigated \nfurther. \n• Tidally influenced data include both watershed and bay sources of nutrients and \ntherefore, cannot be used to identify sources of nutrients from the watershed.  \n \n6 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY \nBased on the findings, TN and TP concentrations measured at three freshwater gages located \nin the Rotten Bayou watershed are generally below or near various Mississippi nutrient \nthreshold concentrations with the exception of data collected during a few storm events in \n2012 and 2014 (Darby 2014).  The TN and TP data collected at a tidal gage just downstream \nof Rotten Bayou exceeded applicable criteria in 2 of the last 3 years.  Based on an evaluation \nof land cover within the sub-watershed above each gage, streamside management is \nrecommended to control nutrient run-off during timber harvesting and re-vegetation.  In \naddition, landside best management practices (BMPs) to control runoff and stormwater are \nrecommended, particularly upland of the Diamondhead and Mill Creek gages. \n \nThe following next steps are recommended for further study: \n• Continue review of the USGS data, which are being collected through 2014. \n• Evaluate land use types near streams for appropriate watershed BMP selection and \nimplementation. \n• Verify if data with TN and TP threshold exceedances were collected during storm \nevents.  Design a stormwater sampling program in areas expected to be \ncontributing higher TN and TP loads. \nAppendix C: Rotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment\n\n \n \n \nRotten Bayou Water Quality Assessment  December 2014 \n 9 141124-01.01 \n• Determine if chlorophyll-a (algal bloom) is a concern in the tidal portion of the \nbayou. \n• Evaluate bacteria data in Rotten Bayou and its tributaries, as available. \n \n7 REFERENCES \nDarby, E., 2014.

BMPs included a dry swale on hole one, a restored stream segment on hole two, and a \nnative planting area on hole three.  The BMPs installed on Diamondhead’s Cardinal Golf Course are not only \nreducing stormwater runoff and improving water quality in a critical area in Rotten Bayou Watershed, but are \nserving as a great outreach tool to education the public. \n\u0004ƉƉĞŶĚŝdž \u001c͗ 5ŝĂŵŽŶĚŚĞĂĚ /ĂƌĚŝŶĂů DŽůĨ /ŽƵƌƐĞ \u0011atƐ\n\nProject Narrative \nSince early 2010 the Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain (LTMCP) and Mississippi State \nUniversity’s Gulf Coast Community Design Studio (GCCDS) have been facilitating the development of a \nWatershed Implementation Plan for Rotten Bayou Watershed in Hancock and Harrison Counties, \nMississippi.  Funding was provided in part by a grant from the US EPA to the Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, Nonpoint Source Branch under provisions of Section 319(h) of the Clean Water \nAct along with state and local match.   \nDeveloping a watershed plan for Rotten Bayou Watershed is a key step in implementing the Coastal \nNutrient Reduction Strategy and improving water quality in the watershed.  Rotten Bayou is a tributary \nof the Bay of St. Louis and is listed on the EPA’s Section 303(d) list of impaired waterbodies for organic \nenrichment, low dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and nutrient levels that do not meet water quality \nstandards.  Many community and agency stakeholders have been involved in the planning process and \nsignificant outreach, education and training has and is being conducted as part of the project.  LTMCP \nand GCCDS were also tasked with planning and implementing best management practices (BMP) within \nthe watershed. \nThe US Geological Survey has been monitoring water quality at four different stations within the \nwatershed.  Preliminary data showed that more of the nutrients common to fertilizers, etc., were \ncoming from the subwatershed that included the city of Diamondhead.  Diamondhead was built as a \nplanned retirement community and is mainly comprised of single family residential and some \nrecreational areas including two, eighteen-hole golf courses.  The golf courses are owned and managed \nby the Diamondhead County Club and Property Owners Association (DPOA) and the golf course \nsuperintendent, Brook Sentell, has been an active participant on the steering committee for the Rotten \nBayou Watershed Project.  Sentell has long been employing best management practices such as soil \ntesting and applying minimal amounts of slow release fertilizer when necessary, but was interested in \ndoing more.   \nLandscape architects with the Golf Coast Community Design Studio and the Mississippi Water Resources \nResearch Institute worked with Sentell to identify areas on Diamondhead’s Cardinal golf course that had \nexisting drainage problems and provided opportunities for slowing and filtering runoff from a larger \narea.  Holes one, two and six were selected.  Initially Sentell was planning on piping, filling and sodding \nthese areas to address the drainage challenges as part of ongoing renovation work on the course.  When \nalternative designs were discussed that would not only address the drainage problems, but would \nreduce maintenance costs and add visual interest to the course, the DPOA agreed to put some of the \nrenovation funding toward installing the suggested BMPs. \nBetween June 2014 and December 2014 Sentell and the partnership worked to install a dry swale on \nhole one (See Image 1), a naturalized stream segment on hole two (See Image 2), and a native planting \narea on hole six (See Image 3).  Cory Gallo, Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture at Mississippi \nState University, working through the Mississippi Water Resources Research Institute, designed the dry \nswale at hole two and suggested plantings for the native planting area on hole six.  Sentell and his team \nwere able to implement both of these BMPs on their own. \nThe stream naturalization at hole two was a more involved project and GCCDS worked closely with \nSentell and his team on this project.  In December 2015, GCCDS staff worked alongside Sentell and his \nAppendix E: Diamondhead Cardinal Golf Course BMPs\n\nstaff to not only do the stream restoration, but to train the DPOA staff in techniques including terracing \nthe streambank, installing erosion control, and planting and maintaining the native vegetation.  The \nDPOA has received considerable positive feedback on the work on all three holes and, as a result of the \ntraining, Sentell and his team are now able to replicate the BMPs at other similar sites on both courses. \nWhile BMP’s of this nature are becoming more common on golf courses around the country, they are \nstill relatively new to Mississippi.  The partners wanted to be able to educate the public on the work \ndone.  To accomplish this, GCCDS designed signage to go at the tee box of each hole where a BMP was \ninstalled (See Image 4), sent out a press release that was picked up by several newspapers in Hancock \nand Harrison Counties (See Supporting Materials); and kept people informed through the Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Partnership’s Facebook page.  In addition, GCCDS coordinated a workshop in July 2015 for \nlocal leadership, landscaping and lawncare professionals, nursery owners and engineers who do work in \nRotten Bayou Watershed.  Participants were able to see the work done on holes one and two and learn \nhow they can apply or encourage BMPs in their own professional or leadership roles. \nThe Coastal Project Coordinator with REACH (Research and Education to Advance Conservation and \nHabitat) has also been serving on the steering committee for the Rotten Bayou Watershed Partnership.  \nREACH has been working primarily in the central and northern parts of the state with a focus on \nagriculture.  Within the past couple of years REACH has been looking for opportunities to expand their \nwork in South Mississippi.  REACH was able to do some water quality monitoring before the BMPs were \ninstalled on the golf course and, as the vegetation becomes more established, is continuing to monitor \nthe water quality at the sites.  While conclusion data is not yet available from their monitoring efforts, it \nwill be a valuable part of evaluating the effectiveness of the BMPs and may encourage more work to be \ndone in other areas along the coast. \nThis project has been such a success due to the partnership between the Land Trust for the Mississippi \nCoastal Plain, the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio and the Diamondhead Country Club and Property \nOwners Association with assistance from the Water Resources Research Institute and monitoring \nthrough REACH.  All three BMPs were accomplished with $1,800 in planning and design work and $5,900 \nin construction labor and materials.  Educational signage for all three holes cost $900, bringing the total \nproject budget to $8,600.  Of the total project budget, $4,200 was grant funded and $4,400 was funded \nby the DPOA. \n \n \n \nAppendix E: Diamondhead Cardinal Golf Course BMPs\n\nAppendix E: Diamondhead Cardinal Golf Course

Initiator of Amendment: Gulf Coast Community Design Studio, as part of the Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Partnership \n \nII. Intent of Ordinance Amendment:  To update the standards related to parking and driveway \nsurfacing requirements to better align with the City’s goals, objectives and policies. \n \nIII. Appropriate Sections of Zoning Code:  \n \nArticle 8.4 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES \nArticle 8.5 OFF STREET LOADING FACILITIES \n \nIV. Background:   \nThe Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain and Mississippi State University’s Gulf Coast \nCommunity Design Studio are facilitating the development of a watershed implementation plan \nfor Rotten Bayou Watershed with the help of community leaders and residents.  Rotten Bayou is \na tributary of the Bay of St. Louis and a significant asset to the City of Diamondhead.  As a result \nof concerns regarding organic enrichment, low dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and nutrient levels \nthat did not meet water quality standards, Rotten Bayou was listed on the EPA’s 2006 Section \n303(d) list of impaired waterways.  This designation triggered the need for a watershed \nimplementation plan to outline steps to improve water quality. \nA preliminary review of US Geological Survey (USGS) water quality data by environmental and \nengineering consulting firm, Anchor QEA, suggests that current nutrient levels are not \nexceedingly high, but do increase during storm events especially coming from the parts of \nDiamondhead within the watershed (most of the area north of I-10).  These findings imply that \nthe area actually has a relatively good standing in terms of water quality, but that any new \ndevelopment has the potential of pushing those nutrient levels higher.  The prevalence of \nimpervious surfaces associated with development increases stormwater runoff and the \npotential for flooding, erosion and pollutants entering the waterways. \nCurrently, the City’s zoning ordinance does not allow for pervious paving options in commercial \nparking areas, loading facilities or access drives.  By allowing and even encouraging the use of \npervious paving options the City would be furthering the environmental goals established in the \n25 Year Comprehensive Plan and taking necessary steps to protect water quality in Rotten \nBayou and the watershed.  The following proposed amendment seeks to allow for pervious \npaving while addressing the City’s concerns about ADA compliance and long-term maintenance. \nAppendix I: Recommended Ordinance Changes\n\n \n2 \n \nBecause the proposed changed would allow for, but not require, permeable paving, the change \nwould not cost the city or deter future development. \n \nV. Relationship to Comprehensive Plan: \nGoal 2: Guide and direct development in a manner which is sensitive and responsible with \nrespect to the natural environment and natural resources. \n \nObjective 2.1: Provide an incentive for developers and land owners to preserve \nenvironmentally sensitive areas and to employ development techniques which result in \nthe conservation of natural resources or otherwise benefit the natural environment. \n \nGoal 18: Develop or encourage building practices, services or procedures within Diamondhead \nthat serve to enhance the natural environment by conserving energy and natural resources. \n \nPolicy 18.4.1: Diamondhead will encourage the use of rain barrels, solar panel \nsystems, pervious paving systems, swales and other similar practices as a means \nto conserve resources. \n \nObjective 18.5: Implement city programs designed to enhance environmental quality. \n \n \nVI. Proposed Amendment: Underlined text represents additions to existing ordinance. \n8.4 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES \n8.4.1 General Requirements \nA. Surfacing of all parking facilities shall be concrete, asphaltic concrete, or asphalt and all \nparking facilities shall be properly graded for drainage and maintained in a good \ncondition, free of weeds, dust, trash and debris, potholes or other surface failures. \nPervious pavement or pervious pavement systems are allowed subject to the provisions \nof Article 8.4.9. \n \n. . . \n8.4.9 Pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems. Pervious pavement or pervious \npavement systems, capable of carrying a wheel load of four thousand (4,000) pounds, including \npervious asphalt, pervious concrete, modular pavers designed to funnel water between blocks, \nlattice or honeycomb shaped concrete grids with turf grass or gravel filled voids to funnel water, \nplastic geocells with turf grass or gravel, reinforced turf grass or gravel with overlaid or \nembedded meshes, or similar structured and durable systems are permitted. Gravel, turf, or \nother materials that are not part of a structured system designed to manage stormwater shall \nnot be considered pervious pavement or a pervious pavement system. Pervious pavement and \npervious pavement systems shall meet the following conditions:  \nA. All materials shall be installed per industry standards.  Appropriate soils and site \nconditions shall exist for the pervious pavement or pervious pavement system to \nfunction. Documentation that verifies appropriate soils and site conditions shall be \nAppendix I: Recommended Ordinance Changes\n\n \n3 \n \nprovided. For further guidance and technical assistance, please refer to the following \nsource:  Georgia Stormwater Management Manual: Volume 2 Technical Handbook. \nB. All materials shall be maintained per industry and city standards. Damaged areas shall \nbe promptly repaired. Gravel that has migrated from the pervious pavement systems \nonto adjacent areas shall be swept and removed regularly.  \nC. Pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems, except for pervious asphalt or \npervious concrete, shall not be used for accessible parking spaces or the accessible \nroute from the accessible space to the principal structure or use served.  \nD. Pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems shall be prohibited in areas used for \nthe dispensing of gasoline or other engine fuels or where hazardous liquids could be \nabsorbed into the soil through the pervious pavement or pervious pavement system.  \nE. Pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems that utilize turf grass shall be limited \nto overflow parking spaces that are not utilized for required parking and that are not \noccupied on a daily or regular basis.  \nF. Pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems used for parking or associated drive \naisles or driveways shall count as impervious surface for the purposes of impervious \nsurface coverage in any zoning district that has a maximum impervious surface limit or \npercentage, except where a pervious pavement system utilizing turf grass is provided \nfor a fire access lane that is independent of a parking lot.  \nG. Pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems shall not allow parking spaces, drives \naisles, or driveways to be located anywhere not otherwise permitted by the regulations \nof this zoning ordinance and the district in which it is located.  \nH. Parking areas shall have the parking spaces marked as required by this article except \nthat pervious pavement systems that utilize gravel or turf may use alternative marking \nto indicate the location of the parking space, including, but not limited to, markings at \nthe end of spaces on the drive aisle or curbing, wheel stops, or concrete or paver strips \nin lieu of painted lines. \n \n. . . \n \n8.4.2 Parking Space Geometry. \nE. Pedestrian walks shall be located between every other (alternating) parking bay, a \nparking bay being the vehicular access aisle and parking spaces on one or both side \nserved by it. If parking bays exceed three hundred (300) feet in length without vehicular \naccess to adjacent bays or to another drive or street, a pedestrian walk shall be provided \nbetween each parking bay. Required pedestrian walks shall have a four foot (4’) clear \nwidth and such width shall be protected and maintained by curbs or wheel guards. All \npedestrian walks shall be paved and maintained free of standing water.

A maximum of two (2) feet of fill material is \nallowed under the roof line and or soffit area of the principle building without retainer methods of \nconstruction. If more than two (2) feet of fill are used, retainer methods of construction shall be \nrequired beyond the initial twenty four (24) inches allowed. When fill material is proposed for an \nattached garage, which is attached to the principle building by common wall and the roof, the finished \nfloor elevation shall be no greater than thirty two (32) inches above existing grade. Fill for all structures \n(foundations, improvements that require fill material shall taper from the edge of the improvement at a \nslope of three horizontal feet for every one vertical foot (3:1). In any case, this fill shall not extend out \nfrom any improvement or foundation more than six (6) feet. No fill shall be placed within three (3) feet \nof the property line. No fill shall be allowed around existing trees which are required to remain and no \nfill shall be allowed around existing trees which are required to remain and no fill shall be allowed in any \nvegetative protection zone. Driveways, parking lots, and detached accessory structures shall be \narranged on the site in a manner that minimizes the alteration or disturbance to existing grades and \nnatural drainage patterns. At completion, a final certificate from a Mississippi Licensed Civil Engineer \nshall be furnished by the owner stating that the lot was graded accordingly before occupancy is granted.  \nBeginning at the property line, the lot shall slope upwards not less than 1 inch in 20' away from the \nreceiving drainage facility unless an alternate slope is approved by the Building Inspector. Such drainage \nto be submitted by a Mississippi Licensed Land Surveyor or Civil Engineer that states the drainage meets \nall state and local codes not to inundate adjacent property.  \n \n  \nAppendix I: Recommended Ordinance Changes\n\nRecommendation 2 \nAdd the following definition to the stormwater ordinance. \nReference: Center for Watershed Protection \nReason: The term “redevelopment” is used in proposed Article 7.0 Section B, Part A) of the stormwater \nordinance. \n \nRedevelopment. A change to previously existing, improved property, including but not limited to the \ndemolition or building of structures, filling, grading, paving, or excavating, but excluding ordinary \nmaintenance activities, remodeling of buildings on the existing footprint, resurfacing of paved areas and \nexterior changes or improvements that do not materially increase or concentrate stormwater runoff or \ncause additional nonpoint source pollution. \n  \nAppendix I: Recommended Ordinance Changes\n\nRecommendation 3 \nMake the following changes to Article 6.0 Section A, first and second bullets, of the stormwater \nordinance. \nReference: Ocean Springs, MS \nReason: This change would align with MDEQ permit language and be consistent with other communities \nin the area. \n \nExisting: \n• 0 < 10,000 square feet of land disturbed: No permit or SWPPP currently required unless \nthe disturbance is part of a Larger Common Plan of Development or Sale. A SWPP may \nbe requested or required if there are complaints or nuisance conditions. \n• 10,000 square feet of land disturbed: Permit required from City of Diamondhead Code \nEnforcement Office (See Appendix). A Small Construction Notice of Intent (NOI) and \nSWPPP must be submitted to the Planning Department (See Appendix B and C for \nexamples). \nProposed: \n• 0 < 1 ac. of land disturbed: No permit or SWPPP required unless the disturbance is part \nof a Larger Common Plan of Development or Sale. However, stormwater pollution \nprevention should be considered during any land disturbance activity, and a SWPPP may \nbe requested or required if there are complaints or nuisance conditions. \n• 1 ac. < 5ac. of land disturbed: Permit required from City of Diamondhead Code \nEnforcement Office (See Appendix). A Small Construction Notice of Intent (NOI) and \nSWPPP must be submitted to the Planning Department (See Appendix B and C for \nexamples). \n \n  \nAppendix I: Recommended Ordinance Changes\n\nRecommendation 4 \nRemove the first sentence of Article 9.0 of the stormwater ordinance. \nReason: The sentence states that the agency (city) will adopt BMPs for water quality. By keeping the rest \nof the section, the ordinance protects the city but doesn’t require it to say how it’s met thereby putting \nthe responsibility on the developer. \nThe Board or their authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying Best \nManagement Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution \nor contamination of stormwater, the storm drainage system, or waters of the U.S.  The owner or \noperator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable \nprotection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm \ndrainage system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, \nany person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, \nmay be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMP’s \nto prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. \nCompliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of \nstormwater associated with industrial activity shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this \nsection. These BMPs shall be part of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) as necessary for \ncompliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. \nAll post-construction BMPs and landscaping designed for the control or management of stormwater \nrunoff and the control of erosion or sediment shall be maintained and cannot be developed for any \nother use which would limit or cause to limit the use of the improvements. Responsibility and \nmaintenance of these improvements shall follow the Ownership of the property. Each property owner \nshall be liable within the contents of his deed for the maintenance of the improvements and must sign a \nPost-Construction Maintenance Agreement with the City. A special note to this effect shall appear on \nany final plat of subdivision. Before granting final approval for the project, the Board of Alderman must \nplace the Post-Construction Maintenance Agreement on the agenda of a regular meeting of the Board \nfor approval.  \nPost-construction BMPs in place and operational prior to the adoption of this ordinance shall be subject \nto execution of a maintenance agreement between the property owner and the city.  In these instances, \nadoption and approval of the maintenance agreement shall follow the same procedures established \nherein for new construction or development. \n  \nAppendix I: Recommended Ordinance Changes\n\nRecommendation 5 \nMake the following changes to Article 7.0 Section B, Part A) of the stormwater ordinance. \nReason: The existing language places the responsibility on the city to ensure that a downstream analysis \nis completed and would require a potentially costly analysis of the downstream watershed. The proposed \nlanguage creates three levels of compliance and requires specific and reasonable levels of flood \nprotection. \n \nExisting:  \nA. It is prohibited to place fill material or construct impervious cover or construct or place any other \nstructure on such person’s property or perform any excavation or grading in a manner, which alters the \nflow of surface water across said property in a manner which damages any adjacent property. \n1. No final subdivision plat, subdivision construction plan, site plan or building permit shall be \napproved by the City unless it can be demonstrated by the owner or developer of such \nproperty that the proposed development will not result in damage to any adjacent or \ndownstream property. This will be certified by a professional engineer’s submittal of \nsufficient data and calculations based upon the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 25-year and 50-year \n24-hour storm events. \nProposed:  \nA. It is prohibited to place fill material or construct impervious cover or construct or place any other \nstructure on such person’s property or perform any excavation or grading in a manner, which alters the \nflow of surface water across said property in a manner which damages any adjacent property. \n1. Sites with 20,000 square feet or more of impervious cover created, added, or replaced \nfor redevelopment must protect downstream overbank flood and property protection \nby controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate \nfor the 2-year, 24-hour storm events.  \n2. Site greater than 1 acre in size with 20,000 square feet or more of impervious cover \ncreated, added, or replaced for redevelopment must provide downstream overbank \nflood and property protection by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate \nto the pre-development rate for the 2- and 5-year, 24-hour storm events, and \ndemonstrate that the 100-year storm can safely pass through the site without creating \ndamaging conditions downstream. \n3. Site greater than 5 acres in size with 40,000 square feet  or more of impervious cover \ncreated, added, or replaced for redevelopment must provide downstream overbank \nflood and property protection by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate \nto the pre-development rate for the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-year, 24-hour storm events, and \ndemonstrate that the 100-year storm can safely pass through the site without creating \ndamaging conditions downstream. \nAppendix I: Recommended Ordinance Changes\n\nRecommendation 6 \nMake the following changes to Article 7.0 Section B, Part B) of the stormwater ordinance. \nReason: The proposed section gives specific references for standards for the various types of BMPs that \ncould be used and also encourages better site design and green infrastructure solutions, which are better \nfor the environment and the watershed. The list of references should be reviewed and added to as \nnecessary. \nExisting: \nB. The above requirement shall be accomplished through one or more of the following options: \n1. Design and construction of an on-site stormwater detention facility, or facilities, by the landowner or \ndeveloper which limits the peak flood flows from the proposed development to the existing peak flood \nflows from the subject tract. \n2. Construction of, or participation in the construction of, off-site drainage improvements, such as storm \ninlets, storm sewers, culverts, channel modifications, land filling, and/or other drainage facilities such \nthat the peak flood flows for fully-developed watershed conditions from the watershed area in which \nthe proposed development is located will be sufficiently and safely passed without flooding of adjacent \nand downstream property and roadways. Because this option alone does not assist the City with \nmaintaining pre-development run-off conditions, it must be used in conjunction with the first or third \noption outlined in this section.  \n3. Design and construction of the development by certified engineering data and calculations utilizing \nlimited impervious cover, infiltration of runoff from impervious cover via flow through pervious areas, \nand/or grass-lined swales or channels such that these measures result in a minimal increase in peak \nflood flows from the development. \n4. All on-site stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to adequately and safely pass all \nstormwater inflows, including flood flows and runoff from upstream and adjacent properties that have \nnatural and/or existing overland flows toward and onto the subject tract. The on-site stormwater \ndetention facilities should not impound stormwater onto or cause backwater to inundate any upstream \nor adjacent properties in excess of existing conditions. \n \nProposed: \nB. The above requirement shall be accomplished through one or more of the following options: \n1. Better Site Planning and Design which involves using site design techniques during the site planning \nand design process that help to minimize land disturbance and reduce the creation of new impervious \nand disturbed land cover. Techniques include reducing clearing and grading limits, reducing roadway \nlengths and widths, and reducing parking lot and building footprints. It also aims to protect valuable \naquatic and terrestrial resources from impacts of the land development process. This should protect \nprimary and secondary conservation areas. \nAppendix I: Recommended Ordinance Changes\n\n  \nFor further guidance and technical assistance, please refer to the following source: \nGeorgia Coastal Stormwater Supplement \n Section 4.3- Site Planning and Design Criteria \n2.

T here is no defined Florida-Friendly fertilizer product, as timing, \nchemistry, grade, amount, site-specific conditions and application practices all affect “Florida-\nfriendliness”.] \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis attached Model Fertilizer Use Ordinance is another tool to reduce sources of nutrients \ncoming from urban landscapes to reduce the impact of nutrients on Florida’s surface and \nground waters.  Limiting the amount of fertilizer applied to the landscape will reduce the risk \nof nutrient enrichment of surface and ground waters, but effective nutrient management \nrequires more comprehensive control measures.  Such a comprehensive approach is needed \nthat may include, but is not limited to, land planning and low-impact development, site plan \ndesign, landscape design, irrigation system design and maintenance, fertilizer application, \nlandscape maintenance, and waste disposal. To assist local governments in improving their \nexisting land development regulations, several “model” ordinances have been developed.  \nThese include: \n \n• “Low Impact Design” ordinances which seek to reduce the impact of urbanization on \nour natural resources by stressing “source controls” that either minimize the \ngeneration of stormwater or minimize the pollutants that can get into stormwater. \nFor example, promoting development designs that minimizes clearing of natural \nvegetation and the compaction of urban soils.  A Model Springs Protection Code \nwas developed by DCA, DEP, and other stakeholders that includes specific Land \nDevelopment Regulation recommendations that promote Low Impact Design.  This \nModel Code is available as Chapter 5 in \nProtecting Florida's Springs: An \nImplementation Guidebook\n. It is available at \nhttp://www.dca.state.fl.us/fdcp/DCP/springs/index.cfm\n.  \n \n• “Landscape Ordinances” because design, construction, and maintenance are major \ndeterminants in the amount of fertilizer and irrigation that is needed to maintain \nhealthy urban landscapes and minimize adverse impacts on water resources.  A \nmodel Landscape Ordinance entitled “Guidelines for Model Ordinance Language for \nProtection of Water Quality and Quantity Using Florida-Friendly Lawns and \nLandscapes” was developed by a group of agencies, industries, and interest groups \nover a two year period and published in 2003.  It was fundamentally an adaptation of \nearlier water conservation ordinances revised to include water quality protections for \ncompliance with Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) or stormwater NPDES \npermit requirements.  The language focused on continuing education of lawn care \nand landscape professionals, proper planning and supervision during development \nand construction, and the use of best management practices, including the Florida-\n1 \n \nAppendix J: Model Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use on Urban Landscapes\n\nFriendly Landscape Program.  This model ordinance has been renamed “Florida-\nFriendly Landscaping™ Model Guidelines for Ordinance Language for Protection of \nWater Quality and Quantity,” updated in 2008 and 2010 and may be downloaded \nfrom: http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/nonpoint/pubs.htm\n.   \n \n•  Finally, the 2004 Florida Legislature directed Florida’s water management districts to \nwork with interested parties to develop landscape irrigation and Florida-Friendly \ndesign standards for new construction (section 373.228, F.S.). Local governments are \nto use the standards and guidelines when developing landscape irrigation and \nFlorida-Friendly ordinances. The Committee on Landscape Irrigation and Florida-\nFriendly Design Standards convened and developed the standards. They are \npublished in a booklet called Landscape Irrigation and Florida-Friendly Design \nStandards (December 2006)\n. The 2009 Legislature has directed that it be revised in \n2011. The current version of this document can be downloaded from:  \nhttp://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/waterpolicy/land_irr.htm\n \n2 \n \nAppendix J: Model Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use on Urban Landscapes\n\n \nMODEL ORDINANCE FOR \nFLORIDA-FRIENDLY USE OF FERTILIZER ON URBAN LANDSCAPES \n(FEBRUARY  2015) \n \n1.  FINDINGS \n \nAs a result of impairment to (MUNICIPALITY / COUNTY)’S surface waters caused by \nexcessive nutrients, or, as a result of increasing levels of nitrogen in the surface and/or \nground water within the aquifers or springs within the boundaries of (municipality/county), \nthe governing body of (municipality / county) has determined that the use of fertilizers on \nlands within (municipality / county) creates a risk to contributing to adverse effects on \nsurface and/or ground water.  Accordingly, the governing board of (municipality/county) \nfinds that management measures \n[Guidance: optional “additional management measures than \nare otherwise”]\n contained in the most recent edition of the “Florida-Friendly Best Management \nPractices for Protection of Water Resources by the Green Industries\n, 2008,”  may be required by this \nordinance.  \n \n2.  PURPOSE AND INTENT \n \nThis  Ordinance  regulates  the  proper  use  of  fertilizers  by  any  applicator;  requires  proper  \ntraining  of  Commercial  and  Institutional  Fertilizer  Applicators;  establishes  training  and  \nlicensing  requirements;  establishes  a  Prohibited  Application  Period;  specifies  allowable  \nfertilizer  application  rates  and  methods,  fertilizer-free  zones,  low  maintenance  zones,  and  \nexemptions.  The Ordinance requires the use of Best Management Practices which provide \nspecific    management    guidelines    to    minimize    negative    secondary    and    cumulative    \nenvironmental  effects  associated  with  the  misuse  of  fertilizers.    These  secondary  and  \ncumulative effects have been observed in and on (MUNICIPALITY / COUNTY)’s natural \nand constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals, springs, lakes, estuaries and \nother  water  bodies.  [Guidance:  as  appropriate]    Collectively,  these  water  bodies  are  an  asset  \ncritical    to    the    environmental,    recreational,    cultural    and    economic    well-being    of    \n(MUNICIPALITY  /  COUNTY)  residents  and  the  health  of  the  public.    Overgrowth  of  \nalgae  and  vegetation  hinder  the  effectiveness  of  flood  attenuation  provided  by  natural  and  \nconstructed  stormwater  conveyances.    Regulation  of  nutrients,  including  both  phosphorus  \nand nitrogen contained in fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality. \n \n3.

This Ordinance shall be prospective only, and shall \nnot impair any existing contracts.  \n \n[Guidance: In 403.9336, the Legislature further finds that local conditions, including variations in \nthe types and quality of water bodies, site-specific soils and geology, and urban or rural densities \nand characteristics, may necessitate the implementation of additional or more stringent fertilizer \n1\n World Meteorological Organization definition of heavy rain: Rainfall greater than or equal to 50 mm (2 inches) in a \n24 hour period. http://severe.worldweather.org/rain/, and forecast keyword  “likely”, \nhttp://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sew/MediaGuide/TermsOutlooks_Watches_Warnings.pdf. \n \n5 \n \n                                                 \nAppendix J: Model Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use on Urban Landscapes\n\nmanagement practices at the local government level.  Local government may adopt additional or \nmore stringent provisions to the model ordinance as provided in 403.9337(2). However, the local \ngovernment should consider the disadvantages of confusing jurisdictional differences and should \nclearly demonstrate they meet the required criteria: \n \n(2) Each county and municipal government located within the watershed of a water body or water \nsegment that is listed as impaired by nutrients pursuant to s. 403.067, shall, at a minimum, adopt \nthe department’s Model Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use on Urban Landscapes. A \nlocal government may adopt additional or more stringent standards than the model ordinance if \nthe following criteria are met: \no (a) The local government has demonstrated, as part of a comprehensive program to \naddress nonpoint sources of nutrient pollution which is science based, and economically \nand technically feasible, that additional or more stringent standards than the model \nordinance are necessary in order to adequately address urban fertilizer contributions to \nnonpoint source nutrient loading to a water body. \no   (b) The local government documents that it has considered all relevant scientific \ninformation, including input from the department, the institute, the Department of \nAgriculture and Consumer Services, and the University of Florida Institute of Food and \nAgricultural Sciences, if provided, on the need for additional or more stringent provisions \nto address fertilizer use as a contributor to water quality degradation. All documentation \nmust become part of the public record before adoption of the additional or more stringent \ncriteria.] \n \n [Guidance: Florida Statues 125.568(3), 166.048(3), 373.185(3),  720.3075(4), and others provide \nthat  a  local  ordinance,  deed  restriction  or  covenant\n may  not  prohibit  or  be  enforced  so  as  to  \nprohibit any property owner from implementing Florida-friendly landscaping on his or her land or \ncreate any requirement or limitation in conflict with any provision of part II of this chapter {373} or \na water shortage order, other order, consumptive use permit, or rule adopted or issued pursuant \nto Chapter 373 part II.]\n \n \n[Guidance:  Florida  Statues  482.156  and  482.1562.  Neither  the  Limited  Commercial  Landscape  \nMaintenance Certification Program nor the Limited Certification for Urban Landscape Commercial \nFertilizer  Application  allows  landscape  maintenance  workers  to  make  any  kind  of  pesticide  \napplications (including weed control and/or weed and feed products) to any turf areas.]  \n \n[Guidance: Florida Statues 482.242, and 487.051 (2), F.S. Regulation of pest control businesses \nand applicators, and of pesticide use, is preempted to the Florida Department of Agriculture and \nConsumer Services (FDACS and suspected pesticide misuse should be reported to FDACS. \n \n \n5.  TIMING OF FERTILIZER APPLICATION  \n \nNo  applicator  shall  apply  fertilizers  containing  nitrogen  and/or  phosphorus  to  turf  and/or  \nlandscape plants during the Prohibited Application Period, or to saturated soils. \n[Guidance:    One  of  the  most  controversial  issues  associated  with  recent  fertilizer  ordinances  \nenacted  by  local  governments  is  the  definition  of  the  Prohibited  Application  Period.    Some  \nordinances have prohibited the application of fertilizer, even slow release formulations, during the \nsummer  rainy  season,  typically  June  1  to  September  30.    The  reasoning  is  that  rain  occurs  \nfrequently,  saturating  the  soil,  leading  to  more  runoff.    Saturated  soils  are  prone  to  runoff  or  \nleaching  with  little  or  no  additional  water,  and  pose  a  higher  than  normal  risk  until  soil  moisture  \ncapacity   is   restored.   Fertilizer   management   is   largely   about   keeping   the   nitrogen   and/or \nphosphorus in the root zone where it can be used by plants.    Periods of heavy rainfall c ontribute \nto leaching, which is washing nutrients out of the root zone, and to runoff, especially in areas with \ncompacted or bare soils and significant slope. V egetative ground cover is important to minimizing \n6 \n \nAppendix J: Model Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use on Urban Landscapes\n\nerosion,  filtering  particulates,  and  incorporating  or  promoting  the  biological  transformation  of  \npotential pollutants.  Many variables influence the relationship between fertilizer rates, vegetation \nhealth  and  nutrient  enrichment  of  surface  and  ground  waters.    Accordingly,  sound  science and \ncarefully  reasoned  judgment  are  recommended  in  determining  how  to  define  the  Prohibited  \nApplication Period.] \n \n6.  FERTILIZER FREE ZONES  \n \nFertilizer  shall  not  be  applied  within  ten  (10)  feet  of  any  pond,  stream,  watercourse,  lake,  \ncanal,  or  wetland  as  defined  by  the  Florida  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  \n(Chapter  62-340,  Florida  Administrative  Code)  or  from  the  top  of  a  seawall,  unless a \ndeflector shield,  drop spreader, or liquid applicator with a visible and sharply defined edge, is \nused,   in   which   case   a   minimum   of   3   feet   shall   be   maintained.   If   more   stringent   \n(MUNICIPALITY / COUNTY) Code regulations apply, this provision does not relieve the \nrequirement  to  adhere  to  the  more  stringent  regulations.    Newly  planted  turf  and/or  \nlandscape plants may be fertilized in this Zone only for a sixty (60) day period beginning 30 \ndays  after  planting if  need  to  allow  the  plants  to  become  well  established  .  Caution  shall  be \nused  to  prevent  direct  deposition  of  nutrients  into  the  water.  [\nGuidance: This  zone  is  a  \nsetback  to  prevent  the  applicator  from  inadvertently  depositing  fertilizer  in  the  water  while  \nperforming the application. It is not designed as a treatment buffer, and is to be adhered to as a \nfundamental  environmental  safety  aspect  of  the  applicator’s  job,  regardless  of  the  owner’s  \ndesires. Some communities have existing residential setbacks of as little as 10 feet from water or \nseawall.  Low  maintenance  zones,  vegetated  filter  strips,  and  riparian  buffers  are  strongly  \nencouraged,  but  such  activities  are  rightly  a  part  of  land  use  planning.  Local  governments  are  \nencouraged to implement these low-impact development practices where feasible.\n] \n \n7.  LOW MAINTENANCE ZONES  \n \nA  voluntary  ten (10)  foot  low  maintenance  zone  is  strongly  recommended,  but  not  \nmandated, from any pond, stream, water course, lake, wetland or from the top of a seawall.  \nA  swale/berm  system  is  recommended  for  installation  at  the  landward  edge  of  this  low  \nmaintenance  zone  to  capture  and  filter  runoff.    If  more  stringent  (MUNICIPALITY  /  \nCOUNTY)  Code  regulations  apply,  this  provision  does  not  relieve  the  requirement  to  \nadhere  to  the  more  stringent  regulations.    No  mowed  or  cut  vegetative  material  may  be \ndeposited or left remaining in this zone or deposited in the water.  Care should be taken to \nprevent the over-spray of aquatic weed products in this zone. \n[Guidance: Care must be taken \nto  ensure  erosion  of  the  surface  soil  does  not  occur.    Excessive  erosion  may  be  a  greater  \npollution hazard than occasional proper applications of fertilizer.] \n \n8.  FERTILIZER CONTENT AND APPLICATION RATES  \n[Guidance: RULE 5E-1.003, F.A.C contains the following provisions for golf courses, parks \nand athletic fields.  As such, no additional specific requirements are included for these types of \nurban turf.  The appropriate Best Management Practices listed below must be followed on such \nsites for nutrient management activities: \n These   include not to exceed rates recommended in the document titled SL191 \n“\nRecommendations for N, P, K and Mg for Golf Course and Athletic Field Fertilization Based on Mehlich \nI Extractant”, and to comply with the recommendations in “BMP’s for the Enhancement of \nEnvironmental Quality on Florida Golf Courses”, published by the Florida Department of \nEnvironmental Protection, dated 2012.  \n7 \n \nAppendix J: Model Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use on Urban Landscapes\n\nNote that this does not exempt applicators at these sites from the required basic Green Industry \nBMP training.  \n \n(a) Fertilizers applied to turf within (MUNICIPALITY / COUNTY) shall be applied in \naccordance with requirements and directions provided by Rule 5E-1.003, Florida \nAdministrative Code\n. \n \n(b) Fertilizer containing nitrogen shall not be applied before seeding or sodding a site, and \nshall not be applied for the first 30 days after seeding or sodding, except when hydro-seeding \nfor temporary or permanent erosion control in an emergency situation (wildfire, etc.), or in \naccordance with the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan for that site. \n  \n(c ) Nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer shall not be applied to turf or landscape plants except as \nprovided in (a) above for turf, or in UF/IFAS recommendations for landscape plants, vegetable \ngardens, and fruit trees and shrubs, unless a soil or tissue deficiency has been verified by an \napproved test.   \n[Guidance: Soil and tissue tests for phosphorus are normally done by UF/IFAS or \nanother accredited laboratory. IFAS recommendations are available from the County Extension service or \nhttp://solutionsforyourlife.ufl.edu/lawn_and_garden/\n]  \n  \n9.  APPLICATION PRACTICES \n \na. Spreader deflector shields are required when fertilizing via rotary (broadcast) spreaders.  \nDeflectors must be positioned such that fertilizer granules are deflected away from all \nimpervious surfaces, fertilizer-free zones and water bodies, including wetlands. \nb. Fertilizer shall not be applied, spilled, or otherwise deposited on any impervious surfaces.   \nc. Any fertilizer applied, spilled, or deposited, either intentionally or accidentally, on any \nimpervious surface shall be immediately and completely removed to the greatest extent \npracticable.   \nd. Fertilizer released on an impervious surface must be immediately contained and either legally \napplied to turf or any other legal site, or returned to the original or other appropriate container.   \ne. In no case shall fertilizer be washed, swept, or blown off impervious surfaces into stormwater \ndrains, ditches, conveyances, or water bodies. \n \n10.  MANAGEMENT OF GRASS CLIPPINGS AND VEGETATIVE MATTER  \n \nIn  no  case  shall  grass  clippings,  vegetative  material,  and/or  vegetative  debris  be  washed,  \nswept, or blown off into stormwater drains, ditches, conveyances, water bodies, wetlands, or \nsidewalks  or  roadways.    Any  material  that  is  accidentally  so  deposited  shall  be  immediately  \nremoved to the maximum extent practicable. \n \n11.  EXEMPTIONS  \n \nThe provisions set forth above in this Ordinance shall not apply to:  \n \n(a) bona  fide  farm  operations  as  defined  in  the  Florida  Right  to  Farm  Act,  Section  823.14  \nFlorida Statutes; \n \n8 \n \nAppendix J: Model Ordinance for Florida-Friendly Fertilizer Use on Urban Landscapes\n\n(b) other properties not subject to or covered under the Florida Right to Farm Act that have \npastures used for grazing livestock;  \n \n(c) any lands used for bona fide scientific research, including,  but not limited to, research on \nthe effects of fertilizer use on urban stormwater, water quality, agronomics, or horticulture. \n[Guidance: Limited  waivers  for  special  cases  such  as  botanical  gardens,  etc.  should  not  be  \nconsidered as less stringent for the purposes of the model as a minimum requirement.] \n \n12.  TRAINING  \n \n(a) All commercial and institutional applicators of fertilizer within the (un)incorporated area \nof (MUNICIPALITY / COUNTY), shall abide by and successfully complete the six-hour \ntraining program in the “Florida Friendly Best Management Practices for Protection of Water Resources \nby the Green Industries” offered by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection \nthrough the University of Florida Extension “Florida-Friendly Landscaping   ™” program, or an \napproved equivalent. \n \n(b) Private, non-commercial applicators are encouraged to follow the recommendations of \nthe University of Florida IFAS Florida Yards and Neighborhoods\n program when applying \nfertilizers.  \n \n[Guidance: A local government may establish a certification/education program for the \ninstitutional or private application of fertilizers indicating the completion of an education program \nfor special local requirements not covered in the above programs.

It replaces any previous BSA advancement manuals, includingAdvancement\nCommittee Policies and Procedures,Advancement and Recognition Policies and Procedures, and previous editions of theGuide to Advancement.\n[Page 2, and 5.0.1.4] — Policy on Unauthorized Changes to Advancement Program\nNo council, committee, district, unit, or individual has the authority to add to, or subtract from, advancement requirements.There are limited\nexceptions relating only to youth members with special needs. For details see section 10, “Advancement for Members With Special Needs”.\n[Page 2] — The “Guide to Safe Scouting” Applies\nPolicies and procedures outlined in theGuide to Safe Scouting,No. 34416, apply to all BSA activities, including those related to advancement and\nEagle Scout service projects.\n[7.0.3.1] — The Buddy System and Certifying Completion\nA youth member must not meet one-on-one with an adult. Sessions with counselors must take place where others can view the interaction, or the\nScout must have a buddy: a friend, parent, guardian, brother, sister, or other relative—or better yet, another Scout working on the same badge—along\nwith him attending the session.\nWhen the Scout meets with the counselor, he should bring any required projects. If these cannot be transported, he should present evidence, such as\nphotographs or adult verification. His unit leader, for example, might state that a satisfactory bridge or tower has been built for the Pioneering merit\nbadge, or that meals were prepared for Cooking. If there are questions that requirements were met, a counselor may confirm with adults involved.\nOnce satisfied, the counselor signs the blue card using the date upon which the Scout completed the requirements, or in the case of partials, initials\nthe individual requirements passed.\nNote that from time to time, it may be appropriate for a requirement that has been met for one badge to also count for another. See “Fulfilling More\nThan One Requirement With a Single Activity,” 4.2.3.6.\n[7.0.3.2] — Group Instruction\nIt is acceptable—and sometimes desirable—for merit badges to be taught in group settings. This often occurs at camp and merit badge midways or\nsimilar events. Interactive group discussions can support learning. The method can also be attractive to “guest experts” assisting registered and\napproved counselors. Slide shows, skits, demonstrations, panels, and various other techniques can also be employed, but as any teacher can attest,\nnot everyone will learn all the material.\nThere must be attention to each individual’s projects and his fulfillment ofallrequirements. We must know that every Scout —actually and\npersonally— completed them. If, for example, a requirement uses words like “show,” “demonstrate,” or “discuss,” then every Scout must do that. It is\nunacceptable to award badges on the basis of sitting in classroomswatchingdemonstrations, or remaining silent during discussions.\nIt is sometimes reported that Scouts who have received merit badges through group instructional settings have not fulfilled all the requirements. To\noffer a quality merit badge program, council and district advancement committees should ensure the following are in place for all group instructional\nevents.\nMerit badge counselors are known to be registered and approved.\nAny guest experts or guest speakers, or others assisting who are not registered and approved as merit badge counselors, do not accept the\nresponsibilities of, or behave as, merit badge counselors, either at a group instructional event or at any other time. Their service is temporary, not\nongoing.\nCounselors agree not to assume prerequisites have been completed without some level of evidence that the work has been done. Pictures and\nletters from other merit badge counselors or unit leaders are the best form of prerequisite documentation when the actual work done cannot be\nbrought to the camp or site of the merit badge event.\nThere is a mechanism for unit leaders or others to report concerns to a council advancement committee on summer camp merit badge programs,\ngroup instructional events, and any other merit badge counseling issues—especially in instances where it is believed BSA procedures are not\nfollowed. See “Reporting Merit Badge Counseling Concerns,” 11.1.0.0.\nThere must be attention to each individual’s projects and his fulfillment of all requirements. We must know that every Scout—actually and\npersonally—completed them.\n[7.0.3.3] — Partial Completions\nA Scout need not pass all the requirements of one merit badge with the same counselor. It may be that due to timing or location issues, etc., he must\nmeet with a different counselor to finish the badge. The Application for Merit Badge has a place to record what has been finished—a “partial.” In the\ncenter section on the reverse of the blue card, the counselor initials for each requirement passed. In the case of a partial completion, the counselor\ndoes not retain his or her portion of the card. A subsequent counselor may choose not to accept partial work, but this should be rare. A Scout, if he\nbelieves he is being treated unfairly, may work with his unit leader to find another counselor. An example for the use of a signed partial would be to\ntake it to camp as proof of prerequisites. Partials have no expiration except the Scout’s 18th birthday. Units, districts, or councils shall not establish\nother expiration dates for partial merit badges.\n[7.0.4.8] — Unofficial Worksheets and Learning Aids\nWorksheets and other materials that may be of assistance in earning merit badges are available from a variety of places including unofficial sources\non the Internet and even troop libraries. Use of these aids is permissible as long as the materials can be correlated with the current requirements that\nScouts must fulfill. Completing “worksheets” may suffice where a requirement calls for something in writing, but this would not work for a requirement\nwhere the Scout must discuss, tell, show, or demonstrate, etc. Note that Scouts shall not be required to use these learning aids in order to complete a\nmerit badge.\nAppendix K: Sample Boy Scout Projects for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nProject Summary  \n \nProject Title:     Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed \n \nOrganization Title:       Gulf Coast Community Design Studio, Mississippi State University \n \nPrinciple Investigator:  Davi\nd Perkes, AIA, Director \n  Gulf Coast Community Design Studio \n  769 Howard Avenue \n  Biloxi, MS 39530 \n \n  Office Phone: 228.436.4661 \n  Em\nail: dperkes@gccds.msstate.edu \n \nScope of Work:   Mississippi State University’s Gulf Coast Community Design Studio, in partnership with East \nHancock Elementary School, Mississippi Wildlife Federation’s (MWF) Adopt-a-Stream Program, NOAA’s \nsNational Coastal Data Development Center (NCCDC), and Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain \n(LTMCP) proposes to work with the fifth grade students at East Hancock Elementary during the 2014-2015 \nacademic year.  There will be approximately 150 fifth grade students enrolled during the 2014-2015 academic \nyear under the guidance of five teachers, the majority of whom live in the Rotten Bayou Watershed \n(Hydrologic Unit Code 031700109-002).  Programming will include a four-day, in-class workshop with the \nstudents based on curriculum developed by the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio in 2012 for sixth graders \nat Biloxi Junior High School (See Appendix D: NEA Environmental Education with Biloxi Junior High School) \nand will focus on how the built environment, human activity and stormwater runoff affect the health of their \nwaterways and watershed.  Students will also go on two field trips – one to collect water quality data with \nassistance from the MWF Adopt-a-Stream Program and another to collect geospatial data with assistance \nfrom NCCDC.  Students will work with GCCDS and partnering organization to analyze, present and share their \ndata both within the school and larger community (See Data Share Plan).  This project will enhance the \ncurrent science curriculum at East Hancock Elementary; assist with the transition to Common Core standards \nby encouraging critical thinking, subject integration and information sharing; and support the efforts of the \nRotten Bayou Watershed Implementation Planning Effort funded by the Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality (MDEQ). \n \nPriorities Addressed:   This project will address the following priorities defined by the Gulf B-WET Program. \n \nI. Meaningful Watershed Educational Experiences for Students:  Students will be engaged both in and \nou t\n of the classroom through an interactive workshop and data collection and observation in the \nfield.  Students will learn to use new equipment and technology including World Water Monitoring \nChallenge chemical kits, aquatic nets, forceps, jeweler’s loupes and digital cameras with GPS.  \nThrough the proposed program students will receive base knowledge, interact with the natural \nenvironmental and reflect on their findings by making connections to other watershed-wide \ninitiatives. \n \nII. GOMA Priorities addressed:  Water quality for healthy beaches and shellfish beds; environmental \neducation; and reducing nutrient inputs to coastal ecosystems.  To a lesser extent wetland and \ncoastal conservation and restoration; identification and characterization of gulf habitats; and coastal \ncommunity resiliency will be addressed. \n \n \nTotal Federal Funding Requested: $44,236.88.  \n \nCost per student:  $294.91 \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\n \nProject Description \n \n \nOrganization and Partners: \n \nThe Gulf Coast Community Design Studio (GCCDS), an outreach program of Mississippi State University’s \nCollege of Architecture, Art + Design, provides professional design and planning services to local communities \nand organizations to assistance in increasing their capacity to address issues of housing, public space, \nneighborhood development and the environment. The GCCDS staff that will manage and implement the \nproject include David Perkes, Architect, Associate Professor and founding Director of the studio, Britton \nJones, Landscape Architect, and Kelsey Johnson, Community Planner (See Appendix B: Resumes) \n \nPartners include East Hancock Elementary School, Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain (LTMCP), \nMississippi Wildlife Federation’s (MWF) Adopt-a-Stream Program, and NOAA’s National Coastal Data \nDevelopment Center (NCDDC) (See Appendix C: Letters of Support). \n \n \nObjectives: \n \nThe educational program for fifth graders at East Hancock Elementary strives to: \n \n• Enhance the current fifth grade science curriculum around issues of stormwater runoff, water \nquality, and the effects of land use, development and human activity on the health of the watershed. \n \n• Utilize creative, innovative and multidisciplinary educational methodologies to inspire learning and \nassist with the transition to Common Core. \n \n• Introduce students to water quality and geospatial data collection techniques and technology. \n \n• Connect students to professionals in the science and design fields to encourage interest in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math (STEM) and higher education. \n \n• Connect students and their families with Rotten Bayou watershed to foster increased stewardship \nand efforts of the Rotten Bayou Watershed Implementation Plan. \n \n \nSummary and Project Justification: \n \nThe Rotten Bayou Watershed (HUC 031700109-002) is 22,446 acres and lies in Harrison and Hancock \nCounties in Mississippi.  Rotten Bayou is a tributary of St. Louis Bay and has a TMDL for organic enrichment, \nlow dissolved oxygen, and nutrients.  The Mississippi Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS ) has \npartnered with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to implement a Coastal \nNutrient Reduction Strategy in Rotten Bayou Watershed.  As part of the initiative, MDEQ is funding the Land \nTrust for Mississippi Coastal Plain and the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio to complete a Watershed \nImplementation Plan (WIP) for Rotten Bayou.  A key part of a WIP is education and outreach.  While the WIP \npartnership is specifically tasked with doing outreach to local officials and professionals, GCCDS is proposing \nto expand this outreach to local teachers, children and their families by leveraging funding through the Gulf \nB-WET Program.   \n \nGCCDS is proposing to engage fifth grade students and teachers in an innovative and interactive educational \nprogram focused on water quality, stormwater runoff and watershed dynamics that would lead to an overall \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\n \nmeaningful watershed educational experience as defined by the Gulf B-WET Program.  The fifth grade at East \nHa n\ncock Elementary located at 4221 Kiln Delisle Road in Kiln, Mississippi was chosen for this outreach effort \nbecause the vast majority if not all of the students live in Rotten Bayou Watershed and key water quality and \nwatershed concepts are introduced to students in the fifth grade based on Mississippi’s science curriculum.  \nWhile the program curriculum is relevant to many coastal watersheds and in line with the Mississippi science \ncurriculum, materials will be modified to highlight the specific characteristics of Rotten Bayou Watershed.  \nStudents will be further connected to their watershed through participation in two field trips throughout the \nyear. \n \nThe proposed educational program is innovative on several fronts.  First, the program is uniquely tailored to \nthe local community and watershed.  The four-day workshop held at the beginning of the program, though \nscience-based, has a strong tie to the planning and design fields further enhancing the multidisciplinary \nnature of the program.  After the students receive some base knowledge from the workshop and are \nprepared to go into the field, they will be guided by science and technical professionals who will help put the \nstudents work into context.  Finally, with assistance from GCCDS and the other partners, students will be \nguided through a process of analyzing, displaying and sharing their findings with each other, the school and \nlarger community. \n \nIn addition to forwarding the Gulf B-WET Programs goal of providing meaningful watershed educational \nexperiences for students, this project directly supports several of the GOMA priorities including water quality \nfor healthy beaches and shellfish beds; environmental education; and reducing nutrient inputs to coastal \necosystems.  To a lesser extent the program also supports and coastal conservation and restoration; \nidentification and characterization of gulf habitats; and coastal community resiliency will be addressed.  \nMany of these goals are directly in line with those of the Coastal Nutrient Reduction Strategy for Rotten \nBayou Watershed and the Rotten Bayou Watershed Implementation Plan that GCCDS is concurrently \ndeveloping with funding from MDEQ through the Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain. \n \n \nMethodology and Deliverables: \n \nPreparation Phase and Classroom Work: \n \nFour In-Class lesson plans, lectures, experiment models, and digital presentations:  GCCDS developed a four \nday science and arts based curriculum on the role people and materials play in the quality and quantity of \nstormwater runoff (See Appendix D: NEA Environmental Education with Biloxi Junior High School). \n \nDay 1 Then & Now discusses the important role water plays in our everyday lives, what our \nwaterways (bays, rivers, bayous & gulf) were like before people inhabited the land around them \nversus, and what the condition they are in now.   \n \nDay 2 Materials discusses how the materials of our build environment (houses/roofs, roads, lawns & \netc.) affect the quantity of stormwater runoff.   \n \nDay 3 Behaviors discussed how our actions and pollution (littering, disposing of paint/oil/chemicals, \ncomposting, water harvesting & etc.) can affect the quality of stormwater runoff.   \n \nDay 4 Improving Stormwater discusses ways that we can make design decisions that positively affect \nstormwater runoff  and ways architects and landscape architects design buildings and spaces to \nimprove stormwater runoff.  \n \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\n \nGCCDS designed an experiment to go along with the lesson plans to demonstrate the issues affecting \nst o\nrmwater runoff quality and quantity. Each teacher will receive a model that consists of four gutters to \nrepresent different materials. Water with materials added to represent pollutants will be poured into the \nfour gutters so the students can compare the quantity and quality of water going in versus that coming out.  \nEach lesson includes an interactive presentation created in PREZI.  This digital tool takes students and \nteachers through the entire lesson plan and experiments in a fun and thorough manner. These are designed \nto teach students about local issues affecting the world around them and the tools created during the project \ncan be used by teachers in future years. \n \nOne take-home brochure about stormwater lesson: GCCDS produced a brochure for students and science \nteachers to take home and share with their family and friends.  The brochure titled What You Can Do to Be a \nStormwater Super Hero discusses what stormwater runoff is, how it can be a problem, why we should care \nand what we can do about it.  The brochure provides information for local resources that can help improve \nstormwater runoff at your own home. This brochure is designed to help reach a broader audience and to \nbring the lessons taught in class back to the student’s home. \n \nArtworks created: During the last three in-class lessons students will be asked to create a piece of art that is \nrepresentative of their own home (materials, site, behaviors and stormwater conditions). Based on what they \nlearned through the four days of lessons, the students will use paper collage and drawing to design \nimprovements for their home that will have a positive impact on stormwater runoff. By applying what they \nwere taught to their design the knowledge gained from the classes will become integrated into their \neveryday lives. \n \nField work and data collection: GCCDS will work in partnership with MWF’s Adopt-a-Stream Program and \nNCDDC to guide the students in field work and data collection around water quality and land use/habitat \nchange.  The Adopt-a-Stream program staff will facilitate the use of World Water Monitoring Challenge \nchemical kits to test various parameters in streams to help determine water quality.  In addition, students will \nlearn about the importance of macroinvertebrates in the water system and how to identify common aquatic \norganisms.  Testing kits and other equipment will be purchased through the grant and given to the teachers \nto use with future classes. \n \nStudents will choose two sites currently being monitored by USGS for the Rotten Bayou Watershed Project.  \nOne to Two classes will go out at various times during the academic year (Fall, Winter and Spring) to collect \ndata at the chosen locations.  Students will be able to compare their data to data collected by USGS and will \nalso be tasked with reporting their findings to the other fifth grade classes not present on that given field trip.  \nDividing up the classes and spreading out the trips over the year will give students the opportunity to see \nvariations in water conditions and challenge them to communicate those findings to their peers.  Water \nquality data will be used in the Rotten Bayou Watershed Implementation Plan and made publically available \non the MWF Adopt-a-Stream program website and the Rotten Bayou Watershed webpage hosted on the \nwebsite of the Land Trust for the Mississippi Coastal Plain (See Appendix E: Data Share Plan). \n \nNOAA’s National Coastal Data Development Center staff will assist the students with collecting digital \nphotographs, GPS coordinates and descriptions about surrounding land uses around the streams that are \nbeing sampled for water quality.  NCDDC will also provide USGS LANDSAT satellite imagery characterizing \nland usage and habitat change over a period of time for Rotten Bayou Watershed.  NCCDC will use the \nstudents’ data for ground truthing and validation of the NOAA imagery analyses and will work with the \nstudents and teachers to make all data accessible online through ESRI’s ArcGIS Online (See Appendix E: Data \nShare Plan). \n \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\n \nOne school-wide and one community exhibit: GC C\nDS will work with students at the end of the academic year \nto design and install an exhibit of their work.  Displaying in the school will the program to reach more of the \nstudent and teacher population along with the issues they were addressing to extend the knowledge and \nconversation beyond the fifth grade.  Following the school-wide exhibit, the installation will be moved to a \nlocation in the community that is publically accessible so that the larger community and Rotten Bayou \nWatershed Implementation Planning Effort can also benefit from the students knowledge and work. \n \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nTimeline: \nGCCDS understands that there may be a need to change the start date of the project.

The materials, equipment and lesson plans, however, will remain with the \nteachers and benefit countless future students. \n \n• Student work and outreach materials will be made available to the rest of the school and the \nstudents’ families further extending the impact of their work. \n \n• Students will develop a stronger connection to their waterways and watershed developing and \nincreased sense of stewardship. \n \n• Interaction with science and design professionals will increase student interest in STEM, thus \ncontributing to NOAA's obligations under the America Competes Act (33 USC 893a(a)) and \nencouraging the importance of higher education. \n \n• Student work and data collected will be utilized by partnering organizations and made available to \nthe larger community which will have the twofold effect of helping the students realize the \nimportance of their work and increasing the communities’ awareness of issues and opportunities in \ntheir watershed. \n \n \nProject Evaluation: \n \nGCCDS is committed to collecting information before, during and after the completion of the proposed \neducation program in order to improve the program’s effectiveness.  At the start of the grant, GCCDS will \nconduct a survey of the participating students to determine their prior knowledge and attitudes about the \ntopics they will study.  Questions will attempt to gain information about the following: \n \n• Student knowledge around issues of stormwater runoff, water quality, and the effects of land use, \ndevelopment and human activity on the health of the watershed; \n \n• Student understanding about their connection to Rotten Bayou Watershed; \n \n• Student interest in higher education and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) \n \n• Students’ inclinations towards environmental stewardship. \n \nResults from this survey will be compared to the results of a survey to be conducted at the end of the \nacademic year to determine how the students understanding and interests have changed as a result of the \nprogram.   \n \nGCCDS will also conduct a survey of students and teachers following each field trip.  This information will be \nused by GCCDS and partners to improve subsequent field trips.  At the end of the academic year, GCCDS will \nsurvey the students and teachers.  Students will be asked to complete the same survey they completed at the \nbeginning of the year so that changes in their knowledge and interests can be evaluated.  Teachers will be \nconsulted to determine their level of satisfaction with the program in terms of student development, teacher \ncapacity building, enhancement of Mississippi science curriculum, and promotion of Common Core \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nstandards.  At the end of the grant, partners will evaluate and summarize the findings of surveys  and provide \nrecommendations for potential program and funding modification. \n \nGCCDS is also aware that grantees may be asked to participate in data collection for the national B-WET \nevaluation and is willing to assist in any way possible. \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nAppendix A: Letter of Support \n \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\n \n \n                                                \nRussell H. Beard \nDirector, NOAA’s National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) \nNOAA Gulf of Mexico Regional Collaboration Team Lead \n \n6 November 2013 \n \nDavid Perkes, Director (AIA)  \n769 Howard Avenue, Biloxi, MS 39530 \n \nDear David: \n \nThe NCDDC strongly endorses your proposal submitted by the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio \nfor educational training of students to enhance their understanding of the impacts of development and \nhuman  activity  on  storm  water  runoff  and  water  quality  as  it  relates  to  the  Rotten  Bayou  watershed \n(Figure 1.)  The in-kind technical support we will offer is an excellent companion piece to the Adopt-\nA-Stream program that will provide training and assistance to the students in water quality testing on \nstreams in Rotten Bayou watershed.   \n \nThe NCDDC will provide USGS  LANDSAT satellite imagery characterizing land usage and habitat \nchange  over  a  period  of  time  (e.g.,  1970-2012),  for  the  Rotten  Bayou  watershed.    For  those  streams \nsampled by the students, we would task the students to undergo field observations for the collection of \ndigital  photographs,  GPS  coordinates,  develop  a  brief  narrative  on  the  stream  characteristics  (e.g., \nestimated  width/depth,  free  flowing,  stagnant,  and/or  intermittent  flow,  presence  of  algae)  and \ndescribe  the  surrounding  land  usage,  e.g.,  housing,  rural,  forest,  wetland,  agricultural,  recreational, \nindustrial  etc.      The  students  will  submit  their  in  situ  observations  to  NCDDC  be  used  for  ground \ntruthing and validation of the NOAA imagery analyses.  The NCDDC staff working with the teachers \nand  students  will  make  all  data  accessible  immediately  upon  validation  via  the  Internet  (Figure  2. \nESRI’s  ArcGIS  Online).    The  data  management  plan  will  incorporate  NOAA  regulations  (Appendix \nA) and NCDDC will assist the PI in preparation. \n \nThis  proposal  addresses  5  of  the  6  established  regional  priorities  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  Alliance \nincluding:   water   quality;   environmental   education;   identification   and   characterization   of   Gulf \nhabitats;  reducing  nutrients  to  coastal  ecosystems;  and,  coastal  community  resilience.    The  project \nwill  greatly  enhance  the  student’s  knowledge  on  the  need  to  monitor  environmental  conditions,  and \nthe  impact  of  development/change  on  the  watershed’s  health.    We  encourage  the  NOAA  B-WET  to \nfund this worthwhile proposal. \n \nRespectfully \n \n \nRussell H Beard \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\n \n \n  \n \n \nFigure 1.

The  White  House  Office  of  Science  and \nTechnology  Policy  (OSTP)  consistently  reaffirm  requirements  for  open  government  and  transparent \naccess   to   digital   data   through   a   series   of   Memorandums   and   Policy   Directives.   The   OSTP \nMemorandum Open Data Policy – Managing Data as an Asset  issued May 9, 2013 directs that data \nand information collected or created with public funds should be managed “... in a way that supports \ndownstream information processing and dissemination activities.”  \n \nOn  behalf  of  the  NOAA  Observing  System  Council  (NOSC)  and  the  NOAA  CIO  Council,  the \nEnvironmental  Data  Management  Committee  (EDMC)  coordinates  the  development  of  NOAA’s \nenvironmental  data  management  strategy  and  policy  in  compliance  with  National  Policy.    NOAA \nAdministrative  Order  (NAO)  212-15  Management  of  Environmental  Data  and  Information  provides \nhigh-level direction to guide consistent implementation of procedures, decisions and actions regarding \nenvironmental  data  and  information  management.  Approved  Procedural  Directives  provide  detailed \nguidance on environmental data management lifecycle components.  \n \nThe  NAO  applies  to  all  NOAA  environmental  data  and  to  the  personnel  and  organizations  that \nmanage  these  data,  unless  exempted  by  statutory  or  regulatory  authority.    The  NOAA  Procedural \nDirective for Data Sharing Policy for Grants and Cooperative Agreements states in part  \n \nAll NOAA Grantees must share data produced under NOAA grants and cooperative agreements in a \ntimely fashion, except where limited by law, regulation, and policy or security requirements. Grantees \nmust address this requirement formally by preparing a Data Sharing Plan as part of their grant project \nnarrative. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\n \nDebra Veeder \n     Mississippi Wildlife Federation \nAdopt-A-Stream Coordinator \n     517 Cobblestone Court, Suite 2 \n     Madison, MS  39110 \n \nNovember 4, 2013 \n \n \nTo Whom It May Concern: \n \nOn behalf of the MS Wildlife Federation Adopt-A-Stream Program we support the funding of a \ngrant proposal submitted by the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio for educational training of \nstudents to enhance their understanding of the impacts of development and human activity on \nstormwater runoff and water quality as it relates to their watershed.   The Adopt-A-Stream \nprogram would be very interested in working with the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio on \nthis proposed project.  The Adopt-A-Stream program will assist the program by providing \ntraining and assistance to the students so that they can do water quality testing on streams in their \nwatershed area.  Adopt-A-Stream can also provide a venue to store and track data that they \nobtain through their water quality testing.  Adopt-A-Stream is a program that is administered \nthrough the Mississippi Wildlife Federation from a grant with the Mississippi Department of \nEnvironmental Quality.   \n \nProjects like these that can educate and involve the community help the water resources that we \nall depend on both economically and aesthetically.

GCCDS and partnering organizations are committed to \nmaintaining and preserving all data collected during the project period. \n \n \nAccess, Sharing and Security: \n \nAll data collected during the project period will be publically available upon validation with no access \nlimitation. \n \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nAppendix E: NEA Environmental Education with Biloxi Junior High School: \n \nThe Gulf Coast Community Design Studio developed and implemented an educational outreach program with \nthe Biloxi Public School District’s sixth grade class of Biloxi Junior High School. The program, which was \ndeveloped and taught in cooperation with the sixth grade science teachers, focused on the role people, the \nbuilt environment, and stormwater play in protecting local waters, one of our most valued resources. During \nfour in-class sessions students learned the importance of healthy water and how stormwater runoff from \ntheir neighborhoods affects the waters quality and quantity. In-class exhibits, interactive presentations, and \nexperiments explained how the materials chosen to build our neighborhoods and the activities done around \nthem can reduce or increase runoff and can contribute or mitigate pollution. With this new knowledge, \nstudents created site plans of their homes including the materials that make them and the activities that take \nplace around the home. They were then asked to identify problems and opportunities for dealing with \nstormwater runoff and develop creative solutions to make improvements to the stormwater runoff leaving \ntheir homes. At the end of the program selected artworks were displayed in a school-wide exhibit for the \nentire student body and teachers to observe. Students were also given brochures and handouts to take home \nand share with their families on the stormwater issues they learned in class. With this program GCCDS was \nable to reach students and their families on an important local issue to the community and offer information, \nresources, and creative and practical solutions to help keep their waters clean. \n \nFour In-Class lesson plans, lectures, experiment models, and digital presentations. The Gulf Coast \nCommunity Design Studio (GCCDS) developed a four day science and arts based curriculum on the role \npeople and materials play in the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff.  Day 1 Then & Now discussed the \nimportant role water plays in our everyday lives, what our waterways (bays, rivers, bayous & gulf) were like \nbefore people inhabited the land around them versus, and what the condition they are in now.  Day 2 \nMaterials discussed how the materials of our build environment (houses/roofs, roads, lawns & etc.) affect \nthe quantity of stormwater runoff.  Day 3 Behaviors discussed how our actions and pollution (littering, \ndisposing of paint/oil/chemicals, composting, water harvesting & etc.) can affect the quality of stormwater \nrunoff.  Day 4 Improving Stormwater discussed ways that we can make design decisions that positively affect \nstormwater runoff  and ways architects and landscape architects design buildings and spaces to improve \nstormwater runoff.  \n \nGCCDS designed and built an experiment to go along with the lesson plans to demonstrate the issues \naffecting stormwater runoff quality and quantity. Each teacher received a model that consisted of four \ngutters to represent different materials. Water with materials added to represent pollutants were poured \ninto the four gutters so the students could compare the quantity and quality of water going in versus that \ncoming out.  \n \nEach lesson included an interactive presentation created in PREZI.  This digital tool takes students and \nteachers through the entire lesson plan and experiments in a fun and thorough manner. These lessons were \nsuccessful in teaching students about local issues affecting the world around them and the tools created \nduring the project can be used by teachers in future years. \n \nOne take home brochure about stormwater lessons. GCCDS produced a brochure for all 6\nth\n grade students \nan d\n science teachers to take home and share with their family and friends.  The brochure titled What You \nCan Do to Be a Stormwater Super Hero discusses what stormwater runoff is, how it can be a problem, why we \nshould care and what we can do about it.  The brochure provided information for local resources that can \nhelp improve stormwater runoff at your own home. This brochure was used to help reach a broader \naudience and to bring the lessons taught in class back to the students home. \n \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\n736 artworks created. During the last three in-class lessons students were asked to create a piece of art that \nwas representative of their own home (materials, site, behaviors and stormwater conditions). Based on what \nthey learned through the four days of lessons, the students used paper collage and drawing to design \nimprovements for their home that would have a positive impact on stormwater runoff. By applying what they \nwere taught to their design the knowledge gained from the classes became integrated into their everyday \nlives. \n \nFour in-class exhibits and one school wide exhibit. GCCDS created four in-class exhibits, one for each \nclassroom.  This included work created during the lessons and aerial map of Biloxi.  Each student wrote or \ndrew their favorite water related activity (fishing, swimming or etc.) on a sticky note and placed it on the map \nat the location of where they like to do that activity.  Each student also placed a sticker indicating \napproximately where they live. This process illustrated the physical relationship between where people live, \nwhere they recreate and why they should care about their local waterways. At the end of the program GCCDS \ninstalled an exhibit of the students’ work located in one of the most visible spaces in the school for 1,200 \nstudents and teachers to observe.  The exhibit introduced the program and its purpose and displayed 80 \nrepresentative works of art created by the students. Displaying in the school allowed the program to reach \nmore of the student and teacher population along with the issues they were addressing to extend the \nknowledge and conversation beyond the sixth grade. \n \n \nAll project activities were carried out with the exception of a change in the number of organizational partners \nworking together on the project as well as the total number of individuals who benefited.  When the scope \nand location of our project changed from Moss Point schools to Biloxi Junior High we neglected to update the \nnumber of partnering organizations with whom we would be working which affected the number of people \nexposed to the project. Instead of working with seven organizational partners, which included several schools \nin Moss Point, three organizations worked together on this project including GCCDS, Biloxi Junior High, and \nthe City of Biloxi. With the reduction in schools involved the number of students, teachers, and family \nmembers who benefited was also reduced from 17,000 to 4200. \n \nThe Gulf Coast Community Design Studio, the grant recipient, initiated and developed project activities along \nwith five teachers from Biloxi Junior High School. The former Biloxi School’s science curriculum coordinator \nand current teacher at Biloxi Junior High helped us define our program and determine the most appropriate \nteachers, class, and age group for conducting the program. This teacher connected GCCDS with four \nenthusiastic sixth grade science teachers who worked to fit the program into their existing strand of earth \nscience curriculum. As GCCDS develop the program content and activities the teachers reviewed and \nsuggested ways to make the materials age appropriate and relevant to their curriculum. Once the program \ncontent was complete GCCDS staff taught twenty-five sixth grade classes per day with the teachers’ \nassistance. Project materials have been passed onto the teachers and they will be prepared to continue the \ncurriculum in future years due to their help in the development and assistance through the entire program.  \n \nThe City of Biloxi was a key partner in providing support and information on the specific local conditions of \nstormwater infrastructure throughout the city. The information provided included the function and types of \ninfrastructure present in the city, as well as mapping information to find the location of different systems. \nThis information was used to create accurate and relevant content to develop a program specific to Biloxi. \n \nThe Arts Endowment outcome of learning was addressed very specifically in this project through the direct \ncontact with 368 Junior High students inside their classroom. GCCDS along with the support and assistance of \nthe sixth grade science teachers taught twenty-five classes per day over a four day period. The program was \nrooted in existing curriculum and used several methods for teaching the program including interactive \npresentations and experiments. It also brought an alternative approach to learning in the sciences by \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nintroducing a design approach method to their inquiries. The level of understanding and learning by the \nstudents was evaluated by the quality and content of the artwork created by the students during the project \nlessons. The content of the artworks reflected what information each student learned during class as well as \nhow they could develop solutions that creatively addressed relevant issues raised during the course. Based \non these measures the outcome of learning was achieved by the students. \n \nThis project benefitted GCCDS by built capacity for developing curriculum and teaching school age students \nabout design related issues and methodology. It also expanded the quality and quantity of outreach materials \navailable and created new teaching tools for future community engagement. \n \nThese materials will be of special interest and benefit to other community design educators as a successful \nmodel and program for those teaching similar issues around the country. We predict the program will \nbecome known through the various national conversations we engage in with others in our field as well as \nfrom our website. \n \nThe principal and educators of Biloxi Junior High were very grateful and supportive of the contribution made \nby this program and our organization during our work together. The impact of this NEA program has led to \nfurther conversations with the school principal on ways to continue working with the school and students \nthrough a variety of new programs. \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nEXPERIMENTS WITH STORMWATER\nMAKING ARTFUL COLLAGES OF OUR HOMES\nEXHIBIT AT BILOXI JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL\nIN CLASS EXHIBITS - WATER ACTIVITIES AND RELATING IT TO WHERE WE LIVE\nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\n \nDAY 1 CONNECTING TO AND CARING FOR OUR LOCAL WATERWAYS \n \nIntroductions (3 min) \n1.

Sum up activity – It is really important for us to understand how what we do at home a\nffects the \nwaterways all around us.\n These four classes we’ll be learning about how to keep our water from \ngetting polluted, how to prevent harm to habitat for animals and plants, and how to keep being able \nto enjoy our favorite water activities.  \n8. If there is extr\na time, go throug\nh the different waterways and ask kids about their activities there. \n \nPREZI BILOXI THEN & NOW \n(25 min – 5 minutes per section) \nA. What is Stormwater Runoff \n1. Definition: Stormwater runoff occurs when rain or other precipitation flows over the ground. Whenever it \nrains, water flows into different systems that might include ditches, drains and pipes, but eventually the \nwater in Biloxi that doesn’t soak into the gro\nund comes out at th\ne Gulf of Mexico. Paved surfaces like \ndriveways, sidewalks and streets prevent stormwater from naturally soaking into the ground. Stormwater \nrunoff is important because it affects how much water we have and how clean that water is. Stormwater \nrunoff affects all the water activities we love! \n2. Video: Intro\nduction to Runo\nff (stop after approx. 2 min) \n3. Introduce the four areas on the map: Beach, Bayou, River and Inland. Have the students raise their hand if \nthey live in one of these areas. We will be looking at what these areas are like now, and what th\ney were \nlike before Biloxi was a\n city.  \n \nB. Beach \n1. Now \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\na. Today, Biloxi has a nice long sandy beach along the water.  \nWhat are some of your favorite beach activities on the map? \ni. The sand is raked and fluffed and groomed for beach activities. \nii. Highway 90 runs beside the beach and is separated from it by a sidewalk and a con\ncrete sea \nwall. The conc\nrete wall is used to keep sand off the highway and protect the beach. \niii. Some buildings are right along the water, like the Beau Rivage. \nb. Stormwater diagram \n \n2. Then \na. There used to be a very narrow beach by the water but most of the sand in today’s beach has \nbeen brou\nght in from other places.  \nOak and cyp\nress trees and grasses grew close to the water. It probably looked a lot more like Deer \nIsland.  \nRain and wind transformed the water’s edge, it was constantly changing. \nb. Stormwater diagram \n \n3. Problems \na. While th\ne beach allows for lots of fun a\nc\ntivities, there are so\nme problems with how stormwater \nflows to the beach. \ni. Pollution comes through pipes and dumps onto the beach or directly into the water. The \nwater is sometimes so polluted that the beach has to close for a couple days.  \nii. Litter from pe\nople’s houses can was\nh onto the beach, affecting animals like this Spork Crab. \niii. Have you found any garbage down at the beach? \niv. How might litter affect some of your favorite activities? \n4. Solutions  \na. The stormwater runoff used to get cleaned by plants and grasses that fl\nowed into small streams \nand then into the Gulf. Planting new vegeta\ntion near the water helps to filter and clean water that \nruns off.   \nb. We can participate in beach clean up days to pick up litter.  \nc. Throw garbage and recycling into containers instead of onto the street or anywhere else where it \ncan was\nh down to the beac   h.  \n \nC. Bayou \n1. Now \na. What are som\ne of your favorite beach activities on the map? \nb. Even if you live right near a bayou, you might not know it. A lot of the waterways in Biloxi have \nbeen piped und\nerground.  \nc. Why put th\ne bayou in a pipe and pave over it? (i.e. to build houses, roads, sidewalks, shops) \nd. There may be a storm drain near your house that runs under the street and comes out of a pipe \n(also called a culvert) into a waterway.  \ne. Stormwater di\nagram  \n \n2. Then \na. Before Biloxi was a\n city, the bayous were lined with marsh grasses and many other plants. Many \nmore animals lived both in the water and along the banks.  There were no pipes, houses or \npavement, and there was a lot more water.  \nb. Stormwater diagram \n \n3. Problems \na. In order to buil\nd ho\nuses and ro\na\nds, the banks of the bayou were all filled in. Lots of vegetation and \nanimal habitat was lost when this happened.  \n \nAppendix

rfaces, and we ca\nn design them in creative ways to help with \nstormwater issues. Planted areas help soak up some of the stormwater.  \nc. Some hard materials like these parking pavers also allow some water to soak through the ground \ninstead of running off into the river.  \n \nE. Inla\nnd \n1. Now \na. There are many areas of Bilox\ni that aren’t close to a waterway. In this part of Biloxi, there are \nmany neighborhoods that have houses with yards and streets.  \nb. Stormwater diagram \n2. Then \na. This is an example of a pine forest, which would have be\nen growin\ng in so\nm\ne parts of Biloxi, away \nfrom the water. There were many species of plants and animals that lived in this type of forest.   \nb. Stormwater diagram  \n3. Problems \na. Even if we don’t live anywhere near the water, many of the things we do at our house or \napartment affe\nct the quality of the wat\ner, and how many pollutants it carries with it on its journey \nto a waterway, like the Back Bay or the Gulf of Mexico.  \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nb. There are a lot of chemicals we use at home, like fertilizer for the grass, paint, motor oil, and all \nthese things can end up in a waterway somewhere if we’re not careful. \nc. One example would be working on a car in the driveway. If some motor oil or gas leaks out, it can \ngo down a drai\nn and dump out into a wat\nerway. \nd. When pets go to the bathroom outside and their waste isn’t picked up, there might be bacteria \nand other harmful chemicals that can end up in the water.  \ne. How might what you do at home aff\nect some of your\n favorite water activities? \n \n4. Solutions \na. We can dispose of harmful chemicals properly.  \nb. Some creative designs can help filter some chemicals out of the water and slow down water as it \nruns off yards. This example is a rain garden, where a ditch is plante\nd with grasses tha  t\n don’t mind \nsitting in water some of the time.  \nc. Another way to prevent all the water from the roof flowing over chemicals you might have in the \nyard or on the driveway is to collect and recycle the rainwater with a barrel. This recycled water \ncan be used to water pla\nnts in the yard.\n  \nF. Conclusion \nThe end! Today we talked about four areas of Biloxi: the beach, the bayou, the river and the inland areas. Even \nif rain falls far away from a waterway, it still has a great affect on the water and on all ou\nr favorite ac ti\nvities. \nTomorrow, we’ll learn about how stormwater runoff moves around at your home through an experiment and \nactivity. We’ll learn all about different materials.  \n \nQuestionnaire (3‐5 min) \nWe have a scavenger hunt for you to complete about your own house or apartment. What I want you to do is \ninvestigate yo\nur home and the land arou\nnd it for these different things. Some are about where certain things are, like \nyour driveway, and others are about what materials you have at home. We will use this on Wednesday to work on a site \nplan.  A site plan is a drawing from above\n, like a close up of an aerial map. We will tea\nch you all about the site plan on \nWednesday, but the scavenger hunt is to get you ready.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix

When it rains, the water that falls around your home either absorbs into the ground or flows across \nthe land and ends up in the Gulf of Mexico. This flowing wa\nter is called runoff. \nB. The other day we talked abo\nut some of the effects runoff can have on the water we use for different \nactivities. Lots of runoff can: (put in main points from Day 1) \n1. Cause flooding \n2.

Then we will use our memory, questionnaire, and imagination to make a picture/plan of all the \nmaterials that are around ou\nr homes  \n \nPREZI & EXPERIMENT: HOW MATERIA\nLS AFFECT STORMWATER RUNOFF (15 min.)  \nA. Objects and materials that make up the place you live absorb different amounts of water or none at \nall. Materials that are able to absorb fluids are called porous. Materials that can’t absorb fluids are \ncalled non por\nous. \n1. Ask for three v\nolunteers to do a demonstration on what it means to be porous. \n2. Two students stand with arms and legs out with their fingers and feet touching representing \nsmall pieces of dirt that are porous.  \n3. A third student representing water tries to get th\nrough the rocks. It’s pretty\n easy. \nName some porous materials: dirt, sand, gravel, grass, oyster shells, fabric \n4. Now the two students stand right next to each other shoulder to shoulder representing a \nnon porous material like concrete. \n5.

Let me walk you through an example sight plan of a friend’s house and another friend’s apartment  \n1. This is a picture of my friend Rac\nhel’s hous   e.  \nThe\n house is close to the street \nIt has a driveway on the right and a sidewalk to the front door \nThere are planter boxes and trees in the front yard \nThere is a shed and a little apartment in the back yard \nThere isn’t much grass in the back yar\nd but there is anot\nher tree \n2. Here is the example site plan we put together or this house \n3. There are a lot of hard surfaces around Sarah’s house so there is a lot of runoff here. \n4.

Here is the exa\nmple site plan we put together or this apartment \n6. There is a lot of paving around the apartment so there is a lot of runoff. \n7. Estimate whether the site plan creates little or a lot of stormwater runoff. \nB. Each student will make a ge\nneric model of home prop   erty using colore\nd paper. \n1. GCCDS will prepare standard size elements (sidewalks, driveway, house, garage, trees, \ngarden, gutters, etc.) \n2. Students will take note of the different materials in their site plan, which ones are porous, or \nnon porous, and estimate if their home cre\nates a lot or a l\nittle stormwater runoff. \n \n \n \n \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nDAY 3 POLLUTION AND YOU‐ ACTIVITIES AND BEHAVIORS THAT AFFECT STORMWATER RUNOFF \nIntro (5 Minutes) \nA. Recap from Day 2 \n1. Reintroduce the ideas of how different materials around your home and neighborhood affect the \namount of runoff that leaves your home and makes its way to the Gulf. \n2. Go over what each type of gutter represe\nnts‐ask students if the\ny can remember the different \ntypes of drainage and ask students to define porosity or other key words\n. \n \nPollution and the world around you (15 minutes) \n \nA. When rain runs off our yards, streets, and roofs it absorbs pollutants and brings them into stormwater \nsystem, which results in high concentrations of pollutants in our Bayous and in the Gulf.  \nB.  In this experiment we will show how pollu\ntants mix with wat  e\nr and how they impact the environment. \nThere are four categories of pollutants and each impacts the environment differently. Begin to mix the \npollutions into the water for drainage test‐as mixing tell students what each thing represents and ask \nthem for examples of things around them and discuss how they impact the water.   \n1. The first type of polluta\nnts are contaminate\ns that dissolve into the water \na. We will use Sprinkles to represent these \nb. Can you think of any contaminants that dissolve in water? (Fertilizer, dog poop, \ndetergents, etc.)  \nc. This type of contaminant reduces th\ne water quality whic\nh limits the amount of species \nthat can survive. In particular, the overuse of fertilizers is a widespread problem, and \ncan drastically affect ecosystems by overloading them with nutrients. Have you heard of \nThe Dead Zone in the Gulf?\n \n2. The second type of pollutants are large amounts of organic matter  \na. We will use Parsley Flakes to represent this \nb. Can you think of an example of this? (Yard trash, leaves, bush or tree trimmings).  \nc. While organic material in small amounts is fine for a water system, lar\nge amounts clog \nup water movement and chan\nge the nutrient balance of the water.  \n3. The third type of pollutants is manmade trash  \na. We will use Red Pepper Flakes to represent this \nb. Examples of this include? (Plastic bottles and bags, newspapers, cans, tires etc. ) \nc. Ingested trash can kill wildlife and large amo\nunts of trash can smother a habitat. Also, as \ntrash brea\nks down it can release harmful chemicals.  \n4. The fourth type is the chemicals that don’t mix with water (hydrophobic)\n \na. We will use Sesame Oil to represent this \nb. Examples of this include? (car oil, gasoline, a lot of industrial waste) \nc. These types of pollutants poison wildlife and persist in the environment for a very long \ntime.  \n \nEye‐Spy/ Behavioral Analysis (10 Minutes)  \n \nA. In each of the following images there are ex\namples of goo\nd and bad beh\na\nvior that affect runoff. Can you \npick out some of these? How do you think they affect the environment? If the behavior is negative, how \nwould you improve it? What kind of pollutant/sprinkle is each of these? \nB. Eye‐Spy 1: The House (from le\nft to right) \no

  en at your home that absor\nbs rainwater? Do you have a rain \nbarrel?   \nC. Using our example home, we might note the planters in the front yard, the semi permeable driveway, the \nwater sprinklers that spray the road, the uncollected animal waste... \nD. For this next part, think abo\nut: \n1. How does water move from your home into the bay? Using a marker/\npencil draw how the water \nmoves off of your roof and into the ground or drain. Where does runoff from your driveway go? \nAnd how about your sidewalk? \n2. Continue to note objects/behaviors that affect runoff. Here are some ideas to kee\np you going: \na. Wha\nt kinds of materials are around your house? Thinking back to our experiment on \nporosity, what materials absorb water and which ones shed it?  \nb. What about the gutter or if you don’t have gutters, where does the runoff from the roof \ncollect? \nc. Where is the nearest drain?  \nd. Is there a pile of orga\nnic wast   e? \ne.\n Do you live near a stream or bayou? Does the water from your house flow into it? \n \n \nAppendix L: Elementary Education for Rotten Bayou Watershed\n\nDAY 4:  What You Can Do to Improve Stormwater \n \nIntroduction/Recap (3 mins)  \nLast week we learned what stormwater runoff is, how materials (or our built world) affect runoff, and we learned how \nour behaviors affect runoff. \nA. Questions to engage the class: \n‐ Who can tell me what runoff is? \n‐ Who ca\nn give me an example of a porous surface and ho\nw that surface affects runoff? \n‐ Who can give me an example of a non‐porous surface and how that surface affects runoff? \n‐ What is an example of a behavior that negatively affects runoff/water quality? \n‐ What is an exa\nmple of a beha   vior\n that positively affects runoff/water quality? \n \nPREZI: IMPROVING STORMWATER AT YOUR HOME (12 MINS)  \nToday we are going to learn about ways we can positively affect (or improve) runoff and water quality! \nIn today’s PREZI you will see how people change their actions to improve water quality and how people / designers \ncreate fun and interesting ways to use runoff and improve\n water quality.  After the PREZI you will use these ideas and \nsome of your own ideas to illustrate on your site plan how you can have a positive effect on stormwater runoff from \nyour own home. \n \nSlide: \n1.
